plaster tied to counter nailed to bench clinched to desk how then is this are the green field gone what do they here but look here come more crowd pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for

travel your thousand mile to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handful of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage a a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persian hold the sea holy why did the greek give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and wa drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all river and ocean it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eye and begin to be over conscious of my lung i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea a a passenger for to go a a passenger you must need have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passenger get sea sick grow quarrelsome don t sleep of night do not enjoy themselves much a a general thing no i never go a a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea a a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such office to those who like them for my part i abominate all honorable respectable toil trial and tribulation of every kind whatsoever it is quite a much a i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ship barque brig schooner and what not and a for going a cook though i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on ship board yet somehow i never fancied broiling fowl though once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptian upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummy of those creature in their huge bake house the pyramid no when i go to sea i go a a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast head true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touch one s sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tar pot you have been lording it a a country schoolmaster making the tallest boy stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoic to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wear off in time what of it if some old hunk of a sea captain order me to get a broom and sweep down the deck what doe that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scale of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel think anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunk in that particular instance who ain t a slave tell me that well then however the old sea captain may order me about however they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hand should rub each other s shoulder blade and be content again i always go to sea a a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passenger a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passenger themselves must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thief entailed upon u but being paid what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ill and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea a a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore castle deck for a in this world head wind are far more prevalent than wind from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarter deck get his atmosphere at second hand from the sailor on the forecastle he think he breathes it first but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leader in many other thing at the same time that the leader little suspect it but wherefore it wa that after having repeatedly smelt the sea a a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fate who ha the constant surveillance of me and secretly dog me and influence me in some unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that wa drawn up a long time ago it came in a a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performance i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united state whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan though i can not tell why it wa exactly that those stage manager the fate put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent part in high tragedy and short and easy part in genteel comedy and jolly part in farce though i can not tell why this wa exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstance i think i can see a little into the spring and motif which being cunningly presented to me under various disguise induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it wa a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motif wa the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant sea where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless peril of the whale these with all the attending marvel of a thousand patagonian sight and sound helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such thing would not have been inducement but a for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for thing remote i love to sail forbidden sea and land on barbarous coast not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with it would they let me since it is but well to be on friendly term with all the inmate of the place one lodge in by reason of these thing then the whaling voyage wa welcome the great flood gate of the wonder world swung open and in the wild conceit that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless procession of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter the carpet bag i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet bag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it wa a saturday night in december much wa i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday a most young candidate for the pain and penalty of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may a well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind wa made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there wa a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford ha of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket wa her great original the tyre of this carthage the place where the first dead american whale wa stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the red men first sally out in canoe to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestone so go the story to throw at the whale in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i wa to eat and sleep meanwhile it wa a very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnel i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few piece of silver so wherever you go ishmael said i to myself a i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and don t be too particular with halting step i paced the street and passed the sign of the crossed harpoon but it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red window of the sword fish inn there came such fervent ray that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inch thick in a hard asphaltic pavement rather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projection because from hard remorseless service the sol of my boot were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sound of the tinkling glass within but go on ishmael said i at last don t you hear get away from before the door your patched boot are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the street that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inn such dreary street block of blackness not house on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look a if it were meant for the us of the public so entering the first thing i did wa to stumble over an ash box in the porch ha thought i ha a the flying particle almost choked me are these ash from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoon and the sword fish this then must need be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black face turned round in their row to peer and beyond a black angel of doom wa beating a book in a pulpit it wa a negro church and the preacher s text wa about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the dock and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these word underneath the spouter inn peter coffin coffin spouter rather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there a the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked a if it might have been carted here from the ruin of some burnt district and a the swinging sign had a poverty stricken sort of creak to it i thought that here wa the very spot for cheap lodging and the best of pea coffee it wa a queer sort of place a gable ended old house one side palsied a it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul s tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in door with his foot on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon say an old writer of whose work i possess the only copy extant it maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both side and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i a this passage occurred to my mind old black letter thou reasonest well yes these eye are window and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didn t stop up the chink and the cranny though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it s too late to make any improvement now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chip were carted off a million year ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and

sigh and being a president of a temperance society he only drink the tepid tear of orphan but no more of this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let u scrape the ice from our frosted foot and see what sort of a place this spouter may be chapter the spouter inn entering that gable ended spouter inn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with old fashioned wainscot reminding one of the bulwark of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it wa only by diligent study and a series of systematic visit to it and careful inquiry of the neighbor that you could any way arrive at an understanding of it purpose such unaccountable mass of shade and shadow that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hag had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you wa a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular line floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet wa there a sort of indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but ala deceptive idea would dart you through it s the black sea in a midnight gale it s the unnatural combat of the four primal element it s a blasted heath it s a hyperborean winter scene it s the breaking up of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancy yielded to that one portentous something in the picture s midst that once found out and all the rest were plain but stop doe it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the artist s design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinion of many aged person with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape horner in a great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there with it three dismantled mast alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast head the opposite wall of this entry wa hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous club and spear some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saw others were tufted with knot of human hair and one wa sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mower you shuddered a you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lance and harpoon all broken and deformed some were storied weapon with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty year ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whale between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoon so like a corkscrew now wa flung in javan sea and run away with by a whale year afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty foot and at last wa found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched way cut through what in old time must have been a great central chimney with fireplace all round you enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beam above and such old wrinkled plank beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft s cockpit especially of such a howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass case filled with dusty rarity gathered from this wide world s remotest nook projecting from the further angle of the room stand a dark looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right whale s head be that how it may there stand the vast arched bone of the whale s jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelf ranged round with old decanter bottle flask and in those jaw of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustle a little withered old man who for their money dearly sell the sailor delirium and death abominable are the tumbler into which he pours his poison though true cylinder without within the villanous green goggling glass deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridian rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpad goblet fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seaman gathered about a table examining by a dim light diver specimen of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house wa full not a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objection to sharing a harpooneer s blanket have ye i s pose you are goin a whalin so you d better get used to that sort of thing i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer wa not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man s blanket i thought so all right take a seat supper you want supper supper ll be ready directly i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar wa still further adorning it with his jack knife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his leg he wa trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didn t make much headway i thought at last some four or five of u were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it wa cold a iceland no fire at all the landlord said he couldn t afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candle each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jacket and hold to our lip cup of scalding tea with our half frozen finger but the fare wa of the most substantial kind not only meat and potato but dumpling good heaven dumpling for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumpling in a most direful manner my boy said the landlord you ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumpling he don t he eats nothing but steak and he like em rare the devil he doe say i where is that harpooneer is he here he ll be here afore long wa the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening a a looker on presently a rioting noise wa heard without starting up the landlord cried that s the grampus s crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three year voyage and a full ship hurrah boy now we ll have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boot wa heard in the entry the door wa flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariner enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coat and with their head muffled in woollen comforter all bedarned and ragged and their beard stiff with icicle they seemed an eruption of bear from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this wa the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch like potion of gin and molasses which he swore wa a sovereign cure for all cold and catarrh whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island the liquor soon mounted into their head a it generally doe even with the arrantest toper newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmate by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making a much noise a the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea god had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner one so far a this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six foot in height with noble shoulder and a chest like a coffer dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face wa deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadow of his eye floated some reminiscence that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he wa a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineer from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companion had mounted to it height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minute however he wa missed by his shipmate and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington where s bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it wa now about nine o clock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgy i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seaman no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i don t know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it come to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objection indefinitely multiply nor wa there any earthly reason why i a a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailor no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor king do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it wa fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen a the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it wa getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming landlord i ve changed my mind about that harpooneer i shan t sleep with him i ll try the bench here just a you please i m sorry i can t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and it s a plaguy rough board here feeling of the knot and notch but wait a bit skrimshander i ve got a carpenter s plane there in the bar wait i say and i ll make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shaving flew right and left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord wa near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven s sake to quit the bed wa soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shaving with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it wa a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it wa a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room wa about four inch higher than the planed one so there wa no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially a another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwind in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldn t i steal a march on him bolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knocking it seemed no bad idea but upon second thought i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon a i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person s bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudice against this unknown harpooneer think i i ll wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i ll have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellow after all there s no telling but though the other boarder kept coming in by one two and three and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer landlord said i what sort of a chap is he doe he always keep such late hour it wa now hard upon twelve o clock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally he s an early bird airley to bed and airley to rise yes he s the bird what catch the worm but to night he went out a peddling you see and i don t see what on airth keep him so late unless may be he can t sell his head can t sell his head what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town that s precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldn t sell it here the market s overstocked with what shouted i with head to be sure ain t there too many head in the world i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you d better stop spinning that yarn to me i m not green may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head i ll break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord s it s broke a ready said he broke said i broke do you mean sartain and that s the very reason he can t sell it i guess landlord said i going up to him a cool a mt hecla in a snow storm landlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating story tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow a sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respect safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good a to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i ve no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rip a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of ha just arrived from the south sea where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand head great curio you know and he s sold all on em but one and that one he s trying to sell to night cause to morrow s sunday and it would not do to be sellin human head about the street when folk is goin to church he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just a he wa goin out of the door with four head strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inion this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business a selling the head of dead idolators depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man he pay reg lar wa the rejoinder but come it s getting dreadful late you had better be turning fluke it s a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed it s an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it wouldn t do come along here i ll give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it s sunday you won t see that harpooneer to night he s come to anchor somewhere come along then do come won t ye come i considered the matter a moment and then up stair we went and i wa ushered into a small room cold a a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneer to sleep abreast there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty a a wash stand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four wall and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of thing not properly belonging to the room there wa a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman s bag containing the harpooneer s wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there wa a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook on the shelf over the fire place and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edge with little tinkling tag something like the stained porcupine quill round an indian moccasin there wa a hole or slit in the middle of this mat a you see the same in south american poncho but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the street of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp a though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head peddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bed side i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeve but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed a i wa and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer s not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloon and boot and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven whether that mattress wa stuffed with corn cob or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door lord save me think i that must be the harpooneer the infernal head peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cord of the large bag i before spoke of a being in the room i wa all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag s mouth this accomplished however he turned round when good heaven what a sight such a face it wa of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking square yes it s just a i thought he s a terrible bedfellow he s been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be sticking plaster at all those black square on his cheek they were stain of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too who falling among the cannibal had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyage must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it s only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the square of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south sea and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effect upon the skin now while all these idea were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a seal skin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hat a new beaver hat when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there wa no hair on his head none to speak of at least nothing but a small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even a it wa i thought something of slipping out of the window but it wa the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this head peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i wa now a much afraid of him a if it wa the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i wa so afraid of him that i wa not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arm a i live these covered part of him were checkered with the same square a his face his back too wa all over the same dark square he seemed to have been in a thirty year war and just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt still more his very leg were marked a if a parcel of dark green frog were running up the trunk of young palm it wa now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south sea and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of head too perhaps the head of his own brother he might take a fancy to mine heaven look at that tomahawk but there wa no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pocket and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on it back and exactly the colour of a three day old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin wa a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it wa not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage go up to the empty fire place and removing the papered fire board set up this little hunch backed image like a tenpin between the andiron the chimney jamb and all the brick inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eye hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what wa next to follow first he take about a double handful of shaving out of his grego pocket and place them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shaving into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatch into the fire and still hastier withdrawal of his finger whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ash a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lip all these strange antic were accompanied by still stranger guttural noise from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket a carelessly a if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceeding increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptom of concluding his business operation and jumping into bed with me i thought it wa high time now or never before the light wa put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say wa a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great cloud of tobacco smoke the next moment the light wa extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural response satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning who e debel you he at last said you no speak e dam me i kill e and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark landlord for god s sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch coffin angel save me speak e tell ee me who ee be or dam me i kill e again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ash about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him don t be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldn t harm a hair of your head stop your grinning shouted i and why didn t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer wa a cannibal i thought ye know d it didn t i tell ye he wa a peddlin head around town but turn fluke again and go to sleep queequeg look here you sabbee me i sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee me sabbee plenty grunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he wa on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what s all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myself the man s a human being just a i am he ha just a much reason to fear me a i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i don t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it s dangerous besides i ain t insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bed rolling over to one side a much a to say i won t touch a leg of ye good night landlord said i you may go i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequeg s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane wa of patchwork full of odd little parti coloured square and triangle and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two part of which were of one precise shade owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeve irregularly rolled up at various time this same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it a the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hue together and it wa only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg wa hugging me my sensation were strange let me try to explain them when i wa a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it wa a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance wa this i had been cutting up some caper or other i think it wa trying to crawl up the chimney a i had seen a little sweep do a few day previous and my stepmother who somehow or other wa all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless my mother dragged me by the leg out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it wa only two o clock in the afternoon of the st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there wa no help for it so up stair i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself a slowly a possible so a to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheet i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hour must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hour in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it wa so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coach in the street and the sound of gay voice all over the house i felt worse and worse at last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged foot sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her foot beseeching her a a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she wa the best and most conscientious of stepmother and back i had to go to my room for several hour i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortune at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from it half steeped in dream i opened my eye and the before sun lit room wa now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing wa to be seen and nothing wa to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bed side for what seemed age piled on age i lay there frozen with the most awful fear not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for day and week and month afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempt to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensation at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg s pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past night s event soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom clasp yet sleeping a he wa he still hugged me tightly a though naught but death should part u twain i now strove to rouse him queequeg but his only answer wa a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling a if it were in a horse collar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage s side a if it were a hatchet faced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequeg in the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulation upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff a a pike staff looking at me and rubbing his eye a if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgiving now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became a it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain sign and sound gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself think i queequeg under the circumstance this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savage have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i wa guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motion for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you don t see every day he and his way were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and then still minus his trowsers he hunted up his boot what under the heaven he did it for i can not tell but his next movement wa to crush himself boot in hand and hat on under the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and straining i inferred he wa hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boot but queequeg do you see wa a creature in the transition stage neither caterpillar nor butterfly he wa just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner his education wa not yet completed he wa an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boot at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eye and began creaking and limping about the room a if not being much accustomed to boot his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide one probably not made to order either rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtain to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boot on i begged him a well a i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloon a soon a possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablution to his chest arm and hand he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i wa watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he take the harpoon from the bed corner slip out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begin a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheek think i queequeg this is using rogers s best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edge are always kept the rest of his toilet wa soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshal s baton chapter breakfast i quickly followed suit and descending into the bar room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the more s the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way and the man that ha anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the bar room wa now full of the boarder who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not a yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mate and second mate and third mate and sea carpenter and sea cooper and sea blacksmith and harpooneer and ship keeper a brown and brawny company with bosky beard an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jacket for morning gown you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellow s healthy cheek is like a sun toasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost a musky he can not have been three day landed from his indian voyage that man next him look a few shade lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless ha tarried whole week ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tint seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climate zone by zone grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite self possessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dog a ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which wa the sum of poor mungo s performance this kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere these reflection just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i wa preparing to hear some good story about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of sea dog many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whale on the high sea entire stranger to them and duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling all of kindred taste looking round a sheepishly at each other a though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountain a curious sight these bashful bear these timid warrior whalemen but a for queequeg why queequeg sat there among them at the head of the table too it so chanced a cool a an icicle to be sure i can not say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many head and grappling the beefsteak towards him but that wa certainly very coolly done by him and every one know that in most people s estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequeg s peculiarity here how he eschewed coffee and hot roll and applied his undivided attention to beefsteak done rare enough that when breakfast wa over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk pipe and wa sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll chapter the street if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual a queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the street of new bedford in thoroughfare nigh the dock any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescript from foreign part even in broadway and chestnut street mediterranean mariner will sometimes jostle the affrighted lady regent street is not unknown to lascar and malay and at bombay in the apollo green live yankee have often scared the native but new bedford beat all water street and wapping in these last mentioned haunt you see only sailor but in new bedford actual cannibal stand chatting at street corner savage outright many of whom yet carry on their bone unholy flesh it make a stranger stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimen of the whaling craft which unheeded reel about the street you will see other sight still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town score of green vermonter and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frame fellow who have felled forest and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale lance many are a green a the green mountain whence they came in some thing you would think them but a few hour old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wear a beaver hat and swallow tailed coat girdled with a sailor belt and sheath knife here come another with a sou wester and a bombazine cloak no town bred dandy will compare with a country bred one i mean a downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that in the dog day will mow his two acre in buckskin glove for fear of tanning his hand now when a country dandy like this take it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and join the great whale fishery you should see the comical thing he doe upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his sea outfit he order bell button to his waistcoat strap to his canvas trowsers ah poor hay seed how bitterly will burst those strap in the first howling gale when thou art driven strap button and all down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town ha only harpooneer cannibal and bumpkin to show her visitor not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for u whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in a howling condition a the coast of labrador a it is part of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine the street do not run with milk nor in the spring time do they pave them with fresh egg yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patrician like house park and garden more opulent than in new bedford whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoon round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave house and flowery garden came from the atlantic pacific and indian ocean one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford father they say give whale for dower to their daughter and portion off their niece with a few porpoise a piece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoir of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their length in spermaceti candle in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maple long avenue of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horse chestnut candelabra wise proffer the passer by their tapering upright cone of congregated blossom so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford ha superinduced bright terrace of flower upon the barren refuse rock thrown aside at creation s final day and the woman of new bedford they bloom like their own red rose but rose only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheek is perennial a sunlight in the seventh heaven elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye can not save in salem where they tell me the young girl breathe such musk their sailor sweetheart smell them mile off shore a though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sand chapter the chapel in this same new bedford there stand a whaleman s chapel and few are the moody fisherman shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailor and sailor wife and widow a muffled silence reigned only broken at time by the shriek of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other a if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent island of men and woman sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablet with black border masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following but i do not pretend to quote sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen wa lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november st this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boat crew of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the off shore ground in the pacific december st this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmate sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bow of his boat wa killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august d this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow shaking off the sleet from my ice glazed hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways wa surprised to see queequeg near me affected by the solemnity of the scene there wa a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage wa the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he wa the only one who could not read and therefore wa not reading those frigid inscription on the wall whether any of the relative of the seaman whose name appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not but so many are the unrecorded accident in the fishery and so plainly did several woman present wear the countenance if not the trapping of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing heart the sight of those bleak tablet sympathetically caused the old wound to bleed afresh oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flower can say here here lie my beloved ye know not the desolation that brood in bosom like these what bitter blank in those black bordered marble which cover no ash what despair in those immovable inscription what deadly void and unbidden infidelity in the line that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrection to the being who have placelessly perished without a grave a well might those tablet stand in the cave of elephanta a here in what census of living creature the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb say of them that they tell no tale though containing more secret than the goodwin sand how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indie of this living earth why the life insurance company pay death forfeiture upon immortal in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lie antique adam who died sixty round century ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city all these thing are not without their meaning but faith like a jackal feed among the tomb and even from these dead doubt she gather her most vital hope it need scarcely to be told with what feeling on the eve of a nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablet and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducement to embark fine chance for promotion it seems aye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whaling a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance methinks that in looking at thing spiritual we are too much like oyster observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lee of my better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheer for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself can not chapter the pulpit i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately a the storm pelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man wa the chaplain yes it wa the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he wa a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many year past had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father mapple wa in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissure of his wrinkle there shone certain mild gleam of a newly developing bloom the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february s snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarity about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoe were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpit it wa a very lofty one and since a regular stair to such a height would by it long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stair substituting a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man rope for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it wa seemed by no mean in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hand grasping the ornamental knob of the man rope father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor like but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the step a if ascending the main top of his vessel the perpendicular part of this side ladder a is usually the case with swinging one were of cloth covered rope only the round were of wood so that at every step there wa a joint at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joint in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i wa not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole wa deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere trick of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly tie and connexion yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a self containing stronghold a lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the wall but the side ladder wa not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplain s former sea farings between the marble cenotaph on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed it back wa adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rock and snowy breaker but high above the flying scud and dark rolling cloud there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel s face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship s tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory s plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the cloud are rolling off serenest azure is at hand nor wa the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture it panelled front wa in the likeness of a ship s bluff bow and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ship s fiddle headed beak what could be more full of meaning for the pulpit is ever this earth s foremost part all the rest come in it rear the pulpit lead the world from thence it is the storm of god s quick wrath is first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the god of breeze fair or foul is first invoked for favourable wind yes the world s a ship on it passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is it prow chapter the sermon father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away to larboard larboard gangway to starboard midships midships there wa a low rumbling of heavy sea boot among the bench and a still slighter shuffling of woman s shoe and all wa quiet again and every eye on the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpit s bow folded his large brown hand across his chest uplifted his closed eye and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in prolonged solemn tone like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog in such tone he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanza burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy the rib and terror in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all god s sun lit wave rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pain and sorrow there which none but they that feel can tell oh i wa plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaint no more the whale did me confine with speed he flew to my relief a on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright a lightning shone the face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaf of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmate clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah shipmate this book containing only four chapter four yarn is one of the smallest strand in the mighty cable of the scripture yet what depth of the soul doe jonah s deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to u is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish s belly how billow like and boisterously grand we feel the flood surging over u we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the water sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about u but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teach shipmate it is a two stranded lesson a lesson to u all a sinful men and a lesson to me a a pilot of the living god a sinful men it is a lesson to u all because it is a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awakened fear the swift punishment repentance prayer and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah a with all sinner among men the sin of this son of amittai wa in his wilful disobedience of the command of god never mind now what that command wa or how conveyed which he found a hard command but all the thing that god would have u do are hard for u to do remember that and hence he oftener command u than endeavor to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god by seeking to flee from him he think that a ship made by men will carry him into country where god doe not reign but only the captain of this earth he skulks about the wharf of joppa and seek a ship that s bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all account tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz that s the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmate cadiz is in spain a far by water from joppa a jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient day when the atlantic wa an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa shipmate is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand mile to the westward from that just outside the strait of gibraltar see ye not then shipmate that jonah sought to flee world wide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the sea so disordered self condemning is his look that had there been policeman in those day jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly he s a fugitive no baggage not a hat box valise or carpet bag no friend accompany him to the wharf with their adieu at last after much dodging search he find the tarshish ship receiving the last item of her cargo and a he step on board to see it captain in the cabin all the sailor for the moment desist from hoisting in the good to mark the stranger s evil eye jonah see this but in vain he try to look all ease and confidence in vain essay his wretched smile strong intuition of the man assure the mariner he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whisper to the other jack he s robbed a widow or joe do you mark him he s a bigamist or harry lad i guess he s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderer from sodom another run to read the bill that s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coin for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he read and look from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmate now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hand upon him frighted jonah tremble and summoning all his boldness to his face only look so much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he make the best of it and when the sailor find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pas and he descends into the cabin who s there cry the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his paper for the custom who s there oh how that harmless question mangle jonah for the instant he almost turn to flee again but he rally i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stand before him but no sooner doe he hear that hollow voice than he dart a scrutinizing glance we sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him no sooner sir soon enough for any honest man that go a passenger ha jonah that s another stab but he swiftly call away the captain from that scent i ll sail with ye he say the passage money how much is that i ll pay now for it is particularly written shipmate a if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning now jonah s captain shipmate wa one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity expose it only in the penniless in this world shipmate sin that pay it way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontier so jonah s captain prepares to test the length of jonah s purse ere he judge him openly he charge him thrice the usual sum and it s assented to then the captain know that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolve to help a flight that pave it rear with gold yet when jonah fairly take out his purse prudent suspicion still molest the captain he ring every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutter and jonah is put down for his passage point out my state room sir say jonah now i m travel weary i need sleep thou lookest like it say the captain there s thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laugh lowly to himself and mutter something about the door of convict cell being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty a he is jonah throw himself into his berth and find the little state room ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasp then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ship s water line jonah feel the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowel ward screwed at it axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonah s room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bale received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying level among which it hung the lamp alarm and frightens jonah a lying in his berth his tormented eye roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive find no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hang in me he groan straight upwards so it burn but the chamber of my soul are all in crookedness like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him a the plungings of the roman race horse but so much the more strike his steel tag into him a one who in that miserable plight still turn and turn in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feel a deep stupor steal over him a over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and there s naught to staunch it so after sore wrestling in his berth jonah s prodigy of ponderous misery drag him drowning down to sleep and now the time of tide ha come the ship cast off her cable and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glide to sea that ship my friend wa the first of recorded smuggler the contraband wa jonah but the sea rebel he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm come on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain call all hand to lighten her when box bale and jar are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunder with trampling foot right over jonah s head in all this raging tumult jonah sleep his hideous sleep he see no black sky and raging sea feel not the reeling timber and little hears he or heed he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the sea after him aye shipmate jonah wa gone down into the side of the ship a berth in the cabin a i have taken it and wa fast asleep but the frightened master come to him and shriek in his dead ear what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that direful cry jonah stagger to his foot and stumbling to the deck grasp a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwark wave after wave thus leap into the ship and finding no speedy vent run roaring fore and aft till the mariner come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever a the white moon show her affrighted face from the steep gully in the blackness overhead aghast jonah see the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep terror upon terror run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitude the god fugitive is now too plainly known the sailor mark him more and more certain grow their suspicion of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lot to see for whose cause this great tempest wa upon them the lot is jonah s that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their question what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmate the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariner but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those question but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him i am a hebrew he cry and then i fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now go on to make a full confession whereupon the mariner became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his desert when wretched jonah cry out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest wa upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other mean to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howl louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah and now behold jonah taken up a an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness float out from the east and the sea is still a jonah carry down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he go down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heed the moment when he drop seething into the yawning jaw awaiting him and the whale shoot to all his ivory teeth like so many white bolt upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fish s belly but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful a he is jonah doe not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feel that his dreadful punishment is just he leaf all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pain and pang he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmate is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god wa this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmate i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you a a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah while he wa speaking these word the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonah s sea storm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved a with a ground swell his tossed arm seemed the warring element at work and the thunder that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearer look on him with a quick fear that wa strange to them there now came a lull in his look a he silently turned over the leaf of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eye for the moment seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these word shipmate god ha laid but one hand upon you both his hand press upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teach to all sinner and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this mast head and sit on the hatch there where you sit and listen a you listen while some one of you read me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teach to me a a pilot of the living god how being an anointed pilot prophet or speaker of true thing and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truth in the ear of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached a we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulf of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the sea where the eddying depth sucked him ten thousand fathom down and the weed were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet out of the belly of hell when the whale grounded upon the ocean s utmost bone even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delight of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beaten his ear like two sea shell still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean jonah did the almighty s bidding and what wa that shipmate to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that wa it this shipmate this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slight it woe to him whom this world charm from gospel duty woe to him who seek to pour oil upon the water when god ha brewed them into a gale woe to him who seek to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world court not dishonor woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him who a the great pilot paul ha it while preaching to others is himself a castaway he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eye a he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm but oh shipmate on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the main truck higher than the kelson is low delight is to him a far far upward and inward delight who against the proud god and commodore of this earth ever stand forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong arm yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world ha gone down beneath him delight is to him who give no quarter in the truth and kill burn and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robe of senator and judge delight top gallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the wave of the billow of the sea of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the age and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breath o father chiefly known to me by thy rod mortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this world s or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hand and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he wa left alone in the place chapter a bosom friend returning to the spouter inn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time he wa sitting on a bench before the fire with his foot on the stove hearth and in one hand wa holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into it face and with a jack knife gently whittling away at it nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the page with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth page a i fancied stopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a long drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time a though he could not count more than fifty and it wa only by such a large number of fifty being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of page wa excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he wa and hideously marred about the face at least to my taste his countenance yet had a something in it which wa by no mean disagreeable you can not hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the trace of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eye fiery black and bold there seemed token of a spirit that would dare a thousand devil and besides all this there wa a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it wa too that his head being shaved his forehead wa drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it wa his head wa phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washington s head a seen in the popular bust of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brow which were likewise very projecting like two long promontory thickly wooded on top queequeg wa george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i wa thus closely scanning him half pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much a a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the page of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savage are strange being at time you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm self collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seaman in the inn he made no advance whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintance all this struck me a mighty singular yet upon second thought there wa something almost sublime in it here wa a man some twenty thousand mile from home by the way of cape horn that is which wa the only way he could get there thrown among people a strange to him a though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely this wa a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there wa such a thing a that but perhaps to be true philosopher we mortal should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon a i hear that such or such a man give himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester a i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after it first intensity ha warmed the air it then only glow to be looked at the evening shade and phantom gathering round the casement and peering in upon u silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swell i began to be sensible of strange feeling i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisy and bland deceit wild he wa a very sight of sight to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same thing that would have repelled most others they were the very magnet that thus drew me i ll try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness ha proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly sign and hint doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advance but presently upon my referring to his last night s hospitality he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellow i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few picture that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sight to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puff from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between u if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan s breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left u crony he seemed to take to me quite a naturally and unbiddenly a i to him and when our smoke wa over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his country s phrase that we were bosom friend he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rule would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollar in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portion pushed one of them towards me and said it wa mine i wa going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pocket i let them stay he then went about his evening prayer took out his idol and removed the paper fireboard by certain sign and symptom i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what wa to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise i wa a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth pagan and all included can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship to do the will of god that is worship and what is the will of god to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me that is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shaving helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own conscience and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosure between friend man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their soul to each other and some old couple often lie and chat over old time till nearly morning thus then in our heart honeymoon lay i and queequeg a cosy loving pair chapter nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short interval and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed leg over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulation what little nappishness remained in u altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though day break wa yet some way down the future yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around u leaning against the head board with our four knee drawn up close together and our two nose bending over them a if our kneepan were warming pan we felt very nice and snug the more so since it wa so chilly out of door indeed out of bed clothes too seeing that there wa no fire in the room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you can not be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomfort of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eye for when between sheet whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eye shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eye be closed a if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essence though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eye then and coming out of my own pleasant and self created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve o clock at night i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puff from his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudice grow when love once come to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord s policy of insurance i wa only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jacket drawn about our shoulder we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over u a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the new lit lamp whether it wa that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scene i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his word yet subsequent disclosure when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such a it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter biographical queequeg wa a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is not down in any map true place never are when a new hatched savage running wild about his native woodland in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goat a if he were a green sapling even then in queequeg s ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father wa a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunt who were the wife of unconquerable warrior there wa excellent blood in his vein royal stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his father s bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian land but the ship having her full complement of seaman spurned his suit and not all the king his father s influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pas through when she quitted the island on one side wa a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thicket that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thicket with it prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship wa gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chain and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ring bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in piece in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlas over his naked wrist queequeg wa the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this fine young savage this sea prince of wale never saw the captain s cabin they put him down among the sailor and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyard of foreign city queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countryman for at bottom so he told me he wa actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christian the art whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but ala the practice of whalemen soon convinced him that even christian could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his father s heathen arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailor did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wage in that place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he it s a wicked world in all meridian i ll die a pagan and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christian wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer way about him though now some time from home by hint i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last account he answered no not yet and added that he wa fearful christianity or rather christian had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan king before him but by and by he said he would return a soon a he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oat in all four ocean they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron wa in lieu of a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movement he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling wa my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket a being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hand in his boldly dip into the potluck of both world to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg he wa an experienced harpooneer and a such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me wa wholly ignorant of the mystery of whaling though well acquainted with the sea a known to merchant seaman his story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter wheelbarrow next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrade s bill using however my comrade s money the grinning landlord a well a the boarder seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg especially a peter coffin s cock and bull story about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our thing including my own poor carpet bag and queequeg s canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf a we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so much for they were used to seeing cannibal like him in their street but at seeing him and me upon such confidential term but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turn and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barb i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ship did not find their own harpoon to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted wa true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it wa of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the heart of whale in short like many inland reaper and mower who go into the farmer meadow armed with their own scythe though in no wise obliged to furnish them even so queequeg for his own private reason preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it wa in sag harbor the owner of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thing though in truth he wa entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow queequeg put his chest upon it lash it fast and then shoulder the barrow and march up the wharf why said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didn t the people laugh upon this he told me another story the people of his island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feast express the fragrant water of young cocoanut into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always form the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and it commander from all account a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captain this commander wa invited to the wedding feast of queequeg s sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guest were assembled at the bride s bamboo cottage this captain march in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king queequeg s father grace being said for those people have their grace a well a we though queequeg told me that unlike u who at such time look downwards to our platter they on the contrary copying the duck glance upwards to the great giver of all feast grace i say being said the high priest open the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating finger into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himself being captain of a ship a having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the king s own house the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hand in the punchbowl taking it i suppose for a huge finger glass now said queequeg what you tink now didn t our people laugh at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terrace of street their ice covered tree all glittering in the clear cold air huge hill and mountain of cask on cask were piled upon her wharf and side by side the world wandering whale ship lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenter and cooper with blended noise of fire and forge to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruise were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begin a second and a second ended only begin a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bow a a young colt his snorting how i snuffed that tartar air how i spurned that turnpike earth that common highway all over dented with the mark of slavish heel and hoof and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no record at the same foam fountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostril swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bow a a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall mast buckling like indian cane in land tornado so full of this reeling scene were we a we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glance of the passenger a lubber like assembly who marvelled that two fellow being should be so companionable a though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some booby and bumpkin there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young sapling mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkin s hour of doom wa come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arm and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in mid somerset the fellow landed with bursting lung upon his foot while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting capting here s the devil hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that don t you know you might have killed that chap what him say said queequeg a he mildly turned to me he say said i that you came near kill e that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn kill e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy small e fish e queequeg no kill e so small e fish e queequeg kill e big whale look you roared the captain i ll kill e you you cannibal if you try any more of your trick aboard here so mind your eye but it so happened just then that it wa high time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main sail had parted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom wa now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly wa swept overboard all hand were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinter nothing wa done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bow and stood eyeing the boom a if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knee and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwark and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom a it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar wa that way trapped and all wa safe the schooner wa run into the wind and while the hand were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minute or more he wa seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arm straight out before him and by turn revealing his brawny shoulder through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now took an instant s glance around him and seeming to see just how matter were dived down and disappeared a few minute more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin wa restored all hand voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive wa there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous society he only asked for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwark and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himself it s a mutual joint stock world in all meridian we cannibal must help these christian chapter nantucket nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stand there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at it a mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than you would use in twenty year a a substitute for blotting paper some gamesome wight will tell you that they have to plant weed there they don t grow naturally that they import canada thistle that they have to send beyond sea for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that piece of wood in nantucket are carried about like bit of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstool before their house to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass make an oasis three blade in a day s walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoe something like laplander snow shoe that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chair and table small clam will sometimes be found adhering a to the back of sea turtle but these extravaganza only show that nantucket is no illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island wa settled by the red men thus go the legend in olden time an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talon with loud lament the parent saw their child borne out of sight over the wide water they resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoe after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket the poor little indian s skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crab and quohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with net for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boat and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ship on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigation round it peeped in at behring s strait and in all season and all ocean declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that ha survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt sea mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panic are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assault and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermit issuing from their ant hill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexander parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian ocean a the three pirate power did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two third of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer s for the sea is his he owns it a emperor own empire other seaman having but a right of way through it merchant ship are but extension bridge armed one but floating fort even pirate and privateer though following the sea a highwayman the road they but plunder other ship other fragment of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riot on the sea he alone in bible language go down to it in ship to and fro ploughing it a his own special plantation there is his home there lie his business which a noah s flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the million in china he life on the sea a prairie cock in the prairie he hide among the wave he climb them a chamois hunter climb the alp for year he know not the land so that when he come to it at last it smell like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset fold her wing and is rocked to sleep between billow so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sail and lay him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herd of walrus and whale chapter chowder it wa quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouter inn had recommended u to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pot whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotel in all nantucket and moreover he had assured u that cousin hosea a he called him wa famous for his chowder in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot luck at the try pot but the direction he had given u about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three point to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place wa these crooked direction of his very much puzzled u at first especially a at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse our first point of departure must be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it wa on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there wa no mistaking two enormous wooden pot painted black and suspended by ass ear swung from the cross tree of an old top mast planted in front of an old doorway the horn of the cross tree were sawed off on the other side so that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i wa over sensitive to such impression at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick wa in my neck a i gazed up to the two remaining horn yes two of them one for queequeg and one for me it s ominous think i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstone staring at me in the whalemen s chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pot too are these last throwing out oblique hint touching tophet i wa called from these reflection by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt get along with ye said she to the man or i ll be combing ye come on queequeg said i all right there s mr hussey and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mr hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affair upon making known our desire for a supper and a bed mr hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered u into a little room and seating u at a table spread with the relic of a recently concluded repast turned round to u and said clam or cod what s that about cod ma am said i with much politeness clam or cod she repeated a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mr hussey say i but that s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time ain t it mr hussey but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who wa waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam mr hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for u both on one clam however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before u but when that smoking chowder came in the mystery wa delightfully explained oh sweet friend hearken to me it wa made of small juicy clam scarcely bigger than hazel nut mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flake the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetite being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mr hussey s clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moment the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine cod chowder wa placed before u we resumed business and while plying our spoon in the bowl think i to myself i wonder now if this here ha any effect on the head what s that stultifying saying about chowder headed people but look queequeg ain t that a live eel in your bowl where s your harpoon fishiest of all fishy place wa the try pot which well deserved it name for the pot there were always boiling chowder chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fish bone coming through your clothes the area before the house wa paved with clam shell mr hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account book bound in superior old shark skin there wa a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fisherman s boat i saw hosea s brindled cow feeding on fish remnant and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod s decapitated head looking very slip shod i assure ye supper concluded we received a lamp and direction from mr hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but a queequeg wa about to precede me up the stair the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chamber why not said i every true whaleman sleep with his harpoon but why not because it s dangerous say she ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort nt v y ge of his when he wa gone four year and a half with only three barrel of ile wa found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarder to take sich dangerous weepons in their room at night so mr queequeg for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod to morrow for breakfast men both say i and let s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety chapter the ship in bed we concocted our plan for the morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting yojo the name of his black little god and yojo had told him two or three time over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whaling fleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch a yojo purposed befriending u and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world a though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg i have forgotten to mention that in many thing queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojo s judgment and surprising forecast of thing and cherished yojo with considerable esteem a a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all case did not succeed in his benevolent design now this plan of queequeg s or rather yojo s touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied upon queequeg s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry u and our fortune securely but a all my remonstrance produced no effect upon queequeg i wa obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom for it seemed that it wa some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how it wa i never could find out for though i applied myself to it several time i never could master his liturgy and xxxix article leaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shaving i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiry i learnt that there were three ship up for three year voyage the devil dam the tit bit and the pequod devil dam i do not know the origin of tit bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember wa the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indian now extinct a the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devil dam from her hopped over to the tit bit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this wa the very ship for u you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i know square toed lugger mountainous japanese junk butter box galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft a this same rare old pequod she wa a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw footed look about her long seasoned and weather stained in the typhoon and calm of all four ocean her old hull s complexion wa darkened like a french grenadier s who ha alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable bow looked bearded her mast cut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original one were lost overboard in a gale her mast stood stiffly up like the spine of the three old king of cologne her ancient deck were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim worshipped flag stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquity were added new and marvellous feature pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many year her chief mate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owner of the pequod this old peleg during the term of his chief mateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkill hake s carved buckler or bedstead she wa apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendant of polished ivory she wa a thing of trophy a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bone of her enemy all round her unpanelled open bulwark were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pin to fasten her old hempen thews and tendon to those thews ran not through base block of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaf of sea ivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller wa in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he hold back his fiery steed by clutching it jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble thing are touched with that now when i looked about the quarter deck for some one having authority in order to propose myself a a candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main mast it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it wa of a conical shape some ten foot high consisting of the long huge slab of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaw of the right whale planted with their broad end on the deck a circle of these slab laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibre waved to and fro like the top knot on some old pottowottamie sachem s head a triangular opening faced towards the bow of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ship s work suspended wa now enjoying respite from the burden of command he wa seated on an old fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which wa formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam wa constructed there wa nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he wa brown and brawny like most old seaman and heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style only there wa a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minutest wrinkle interlacing round his eye which must have arisen from his continual sailing in many hard gale and always looking to windward for this cause the muscle about the eye to become pursed together such eye wrinkle are very effectual in a scowl is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of the tent supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him he demanded i wa thinking of shipping thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketer ever been in a stove boat no sir i never have dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare say eh nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn i ve been several voyage in the merchant service and i think that merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that leg i ll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ship but fluke man what make thee want to go a whaling eh it look a little suspicious don t it eh hast not been a pirate hast thou didst not rob thy last captain didst thou dost not think of murdering the officer when thou gettest to sea i protested my innocence of these thing i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendo this old seaman a an insulated quakerish nantucketer wa full of his insular prejudice and rather distrustful of all alien unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard but what take thee a whaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab who is captain ahab sir aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship i am mistaken then i thought i wa speaking to the captain himself thou art speaking to captain peleg that s who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her need including crew we are part owner and agent but a i wa going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is a thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he ha only one leg what do you mean sir wa the other one lost by a whale lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it wa devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat ah ah i wa a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said a calmly a i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there wa any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred a much from the simple fact of the accident look ye now young man thy lung are a sort of soft d ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit sure ye ve been to sea before now sure of that sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyage in the merchant hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant service don t aggravate me i won t have it but let u understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it i do sir very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale s throat and then jump after it answer quick i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i don t take to be the fact good again now then thou not only wantest to go a whaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world wa not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crow s foot into one scowl captain peleg started me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide wa now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect wa unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see well what s the report said peleg when i came back what did ye see not much i replied nothing but water considerable horizon though and there s a squall coming up i think well what doe thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh can t ye see the world where you stand i wa a little staggered but go a whaling i must and i would and the pequod wa a good a ship a any i thought the best and all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me and thou mayest a well sign the paper right off he added come along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin seated on the transom wa what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg wa one of the largest owner of the vessel the other share a is sometimes the case in these port being held by a crowd of old annuitant widow fatherless child and chancery ward each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessel the same way that you do yours in approved state stock bringing in good interest now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers wa a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day it inhabitant in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarity of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by thing altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quaker are the most sanguinary of all sailor and whale hunter they are fighting quaker they are quaker with a vengeance so that there are instance among them of men who named with scripture name a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent life strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarity a thousand bold dash of character not unworthy a scandinavian sea king or a poetical pagan roman and when these thing unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who ha also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night watch in the remotest water and beneath constellation never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all nature s sweet or savage impression fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantage to learn a bold and nervous lofty language that man make one in a whole nation s census a mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedy nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstance he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but a yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only result again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstance like captain peleg captain bildad wa a well to do retired whaleman but unlike captain peleg who cared not a rush for what are called serious thing and indeed deemed those self same serious thing the veriest of all trifle captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creature round the horn all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much a altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness wa there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruple to bear arm against land invader yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled tun upon tun of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his day the pious bildad reconciled these thing in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man s religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this world pay dividend rising from a little cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad bellied waistcoat from that becoming boat header chief mate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad a i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining day to the quiet receiving of his well earned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunk and in his sea going day a bitter hard task master they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he wa certainly rather hard hearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad wa a chief mate to have his drab coloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something a hammer or a marling spike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person wa the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat such then wa the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the deck wa small and there bolt upright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tail his broad brim wa placed beside him his leg were stiffly crossed his drab vesture wa buttoned up to his chin and spectacle on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scripture now for the last thirty year to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad a if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg he say he s our man bildad said peleg he want to ship dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me i dost said i unconsciously he wa so intense a quaker what do ye think of him bildad said peleg he ll do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially a peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ship s article placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it wa high time to settle with myself at what term i would be willing to engage for the voyage i wa already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wage but all hand including the captain received certain share of the profit called lay and that these lay were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duty of the ship s company i wa also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i wa used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the th lay that is the th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the th lay wa what they call a rather long lay yet it wa better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three year beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver it might be thought that this wa a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune and so it wa a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortune and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the th considering i wa of a broad shouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profit wa this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietor of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owner left nearly the whole management of the ship s affair to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hand especially a i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible a if at his own fireside now while peleg wa vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack knife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he wa such an interested party in these proceeding bildad never heeded u but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth where moth well captain bildad interrupted peleg what d ye say what lay shall we give this young man thou knowest best wa the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and seventy seventh wouldn t be too much would it where moth and rust do corrupt but lay lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventy seventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many lay here below where moth and rust do corrupt it wa an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy seven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventy seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy seven gold doubloon and so i thought at the time why blast your eye bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that seven hundred and seventy seventh again said bildad without lifting his eye and then went on mumbling for where your treasure is there will your heart be also i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owner of this ship widow and orphan many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labor of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widow and those orphan the seven hundred and seventy seventh lay captain peleg thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matter i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inch of water or ten fathom i can t tell but a thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me it s an all fired outrage to tell any human creature that he s bound to hell fluke and flame bildad say that again to me and start my soul bolt but i ll i ll yes i ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horn on out of the cabin ye canting drab coloured son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye a he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owner of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt wa all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his way a for peleg after letting off his rage a he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little a if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at last the squall s gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack knife here need the grindstone that s he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmael s thy name didn t ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who want to ship too shall i bring him down to morrow to be sure said peleg fetch him along and we ll look at him what lay doe he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg ha he ever whaled it any turning to me killed more whale than i can count captain peleg well bring him along then and after signing the paper off i went nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning s work and that the pequod wa the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i wa to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many case a whale ship will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain make himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyage are so prolonged and the shore interval at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he doe not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaf her to the owner till all is ready for sea however it is always a well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hand turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab wa to be found and what dost thou want of captain ahab it s all right enough thou art shipped yes but i should like to see him but i don t think thou wilt be able to at present i don t know exactly what s the matter with him but he keep close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he don t look so in fact he ain t sick but no he isn t well either any how young man he won t always see me so i don t suppose he will thee he s a queer man captain ahab so some think but a good one oh thou lt like him well enough no fear no fear he s a grand ungodly god like man captain ahab doesn t speak much but when he doe speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahab s above the common ahab s been in college a well a mong the cannibal been used to deeper wonder than the wave fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foe than whale his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he ain t captain bildad no and he ain t captain peleg he s ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest wa a crowned king and a very vile one when that wicked king wa slain the dog did they not lick his blood come hither to me hither hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he wa only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fool like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee it s a lie i know captain ahab well i ve sailed with him a mate year ago i know what he is a good man not a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good man something like me only there s a good deal more of him aye aye i know that he wa never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he wa a little out of his mind for a spell but it wa the sharp shooting pain in his bleeding stump that brought that about a any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale he s been a kind of moody desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pas off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man it s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he ha a wife not three voyage wedded a sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man ha a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab ha his humanity a i walked away i wa full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don t know what unless it wa the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i can not at all describe wa not exactly awe i do not know what it wa but i felt it and it did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly a he wa known to me then however my thought were at length carried in other direction so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind chapter the ramadan a queequeg s ramadan or fasting and humiliation wa to continue all day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night fall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody s religious obligation never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ant worshipping a toad stool or those other creature in certain part of our earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planet bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possession yet owned and rented in his name i say we good presbyterian christian should be charitable in these thing and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortal pagan and what not because of their half crazy conceit on these subject there wa queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notion about yojo and his ramadan but what of that queequeg thought he knew what he wa about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on u all presbyterian and pagan alike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending towards evening when i felt assured that all his performance and ritual must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer i tried to open it but it wa fastened inside queequeg said i softly through the key hole all silent i say queequeg why don t you speak it s i ishmael but all remained still a before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key hole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect wa but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i wa surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg s harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber that s strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stand yonder and he seldom or never go abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake queequeg queequeg all still something must have happened apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stair i quickly stated my suspicion to the first person i met the chamber maid la la she cried i thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door wa locked and not a mouse to be heard and it s been just so silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping la la ma am mistress murder mr hussey apoplexy and with these cry she ran towards the kitchen i following mr hussey soon appeared with a mustard pot in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castor and scolding her little black boy meantime wood house cried i which way to it run for god s sake and fetch something to pry open the door the axe the axe he s had a stroke depend upon it and so saying i wa unmethodically rushing up stair again empty handed when mr hussey interposed the mustard pot and vinegar cruet and the entire castor of her countenance what s the matter with you young man get the axe for god s sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so a to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my door and with that she seized my arm what s the matter with you what s the matter with you shipmate in a calm but rapid a manner a possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegar cruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimed no i haven t seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing of the stair she glanced in and returning told me that queequeg s harpoon wa missing he s killed himself she cried it s unfort nate stiggs done over again there go another counterpane god pity his poor mother it will be the ruin of my house ha the poor lad a sister where s that girl there betty go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign with no suicide permitted here and no smoking in the parlor might a well kill both bird at once kill the lord be merciful to his ghost what s that noise there you young man avast there and running up after me she caught me a i wa again trying to force open the door i don t allow it i won t have my premise spoiled go for the locksmith there s one about a mile from here but avast putting her hand in her side pocket here s a key that ll fit i guess let s see and with that she turned it in the lock but ala queequeg s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within have to burst it open said i and wa running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premise but i tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heaven there sat queequeg altogether cool and self collected right in the middle of the room squatting on his ham and holding yojo on top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life queequeg said i going up to him queequeg what s the matter with you he hain t been a sittin so all day ha he said the landlady but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so a to change his position for it wa almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially a in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hour going too without his regular meal mr hussey said i he s alive at all event so leave u if you please and i will see to this strange affair myself closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could do for all my polite art and blandishment he would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their ham that way in his native island it must be so yes it s part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest he ll get up sooner or later no doubt it can t last for ever thank god and his ramadan only come once a year and i don t believe it s very punctual then i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long story of some sailor who had just come from a plum pudding voyage a they called it that is a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven o clock i went up stair to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he wa just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his ham in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head for heaven s sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper you ll starve you ll kill yourself queequeg but not a word did he reply despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him a it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of queequeg not four foot off sitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his ham in this dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg a if he had been screwed down to the floor but a soon a the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joint but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan wa over now a i before hinted i have no objection to any person s religion be it what it may so long a that person doe not kill or insult any other person because that other person don t believe it also but when a man s religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine make this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religion and coming down to the various religion of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lent ramadan and prolonged ham squatting in cold cheerless room were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious law of hygiene and common sense i told him too that he being in other thing such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his besides argued i fasting make the body cave in hence the spirit cave in and all thought born of a fast must necessarily be half starved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionist cherish such melancholy notion about their hereafter in one word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsia nurtured by ramadan i then asked queequeg whether he himself wa ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it wa after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o clock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inference without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it wa the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trencher and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanut and with some parsley in their mouth were sent round with the victor s compliment to all his friend just a though these present were so many christmas turkey after all i do not think that my remark about religion made much impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my idea simply a i would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion a though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowder of all sort so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bone chapter his mark a we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed u from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend wa a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibal on board that craft unless they previously produced their paper what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwark and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf i mean he replied he must show his paper yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind peleg s out of the wigwam he must show that he s converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in communion with any christian church why said i he s a member of the first congregational church here be it said that many tattooed savage sailing in nantucket ship at last come to be converted into the church first congregational church cried bildad what that worship in deacon deuteronomy coleman s meeting house and so saying taking out his spectacle he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwark took a good long look at queequeg how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man no said peleg and he hasn t been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devil s blue off his face do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomy s meeting i never saw him going there and i pas it every lord s day i don t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with me explain thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of u and every mother s son and soul of u belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of u cherish some queer crotchet no way touching the grand belief in that we all join hand splice thou mean st splice hand cried peleg drawing nearer young man you d better ship for a missionary instead of a fore mast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomy why father mapple himself couldn t beat it and he s reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the paper i say tell quohog there what s that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon he s got there look like good stuff that and he handle it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whale boat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwark from thence into the bow of one of the whale boat hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way a this cap ain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildad s broad brim clean across the ship s deck and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line spos ee him whale e eye why dad whale dead quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ship s paper we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boat look ye quohog we ll give ye the ninetieth lay and that s more than ever wa given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg wa soon enrolled among the same ship s company to which i myself belonged when all preliminary were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there don t know how to write doe he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremony looked no way abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which wa tattooed upon his arm so that through captain peleg s obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this quohog his x mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pocket of his broad skirted drab coat took out a bundle of tract and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in queequeg s hand and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eye and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the soul of all it crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan way which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad s language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrase avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg pious harpooneer never make good voyager it take the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there wa young nat swaine once the bravest boat header out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whale for fear of after clap in case he got stove and went to davy jones peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eye and hand thou thyself a i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then can st thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three mast overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did st thou not think of death and the judgment then hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hand far down into his pocket hear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three mast making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over u fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life wa what captain ahab and i wa thinking of and how to save all hand how to rig jury mast how to get into the nearest port that wa what i wa thinking of bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmaker who were mending a top sail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter the prophet shipmate have ye shipped in that ship queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thought when the above word were put to u by a stranger who pausing before u levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he wa but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent small pox had in all direction flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing water have been dried up have ye shipped in her he repeated you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him aye the pequod that ship there he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object yes said i we have just signed the article anything down there about your soul about what oh perhaps you hav n t got any he said quickly no matter though i know many chap that hav n t got any good luck to em and they are all the better off for it a soul s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon what are you jabbering about shipmate said i he s got enough though to make up for all deficiency of that sort in other chap abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he queequeg said i let s go this fellow ha broken loose from somewhere he s talking about something and somebody we don t know stop cried the stranger ye said true ye hav n t seen old thunder yet have ye who s old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner captain ahab what the captain of our ship the pequod aye among some of u old sailor chap he go by that name ye hav n t seen him yet have ye no we hav n t he s sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before what do you know about him what did they tell you about him say that they didn t tell much of anything about him only i ve heard that he s a good whale hunter and a good captain to his crew that s true that s true yes both true enough but you must jump when he give an order step and growl growl and go that s the word with captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three day and night nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa heard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didn t ye hear a word about them matter and something more eh no i don t think ye did how could ye who know it not all nantucket i guess but hows ever mayhap ye ve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes that every one know a most i mean they know he s only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i don t know and i don t much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg all about it eh sure you do all pretty sure with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar like stranger stood a moment a if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and said ye ve shipped have ye name down on the paper well well what s signed is signed and what s to be will be and then again perhaps it won t be after all anyhow it s all fixed and arranged a ready and some sailor or other must go with him i suppose a well these a any other men god pity em morning to ye shipmate morning the ineffable heaven bless ye i m sorry i stopped ye look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell u out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle u you are mistaken in your game that s all i have to say and it s said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him the like of ye morning to ye shipmate morning oh when ye get there tell em i ve concluded not to make one of em ah my dear fellow you can t fool u that way you can t fool u it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look a if he had a great secret in him morning to ye shipmate morning morning it is said i come along queequeg let s leave this crazy man but stop tell me your name will you elijah elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each other s fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he wa nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yard when chancing to turn a corner and looking back a i did so who should be seen but elijah following u though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he wa dogging u but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half hinting half revealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kind of vague wonderment and half apprehension and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy thing i wa resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah wa really dogging u or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our step but elijah passed on without seeming to notice u this relieved me and once more and finally a it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter all astir a day or two passed and there wa great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sail being mended but new sail were coming on board and bolt of canvas and coil of rigging in short everything betokened that the ship s preparation were hurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look out upon the hand bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the store and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night fall on the day following queequeg s signing the article word wa given at all the inn where the ship s company were stopping that their chest must be on board before night for there wa no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our trap resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they always give very long notice in these case and the ship did not sail for several day but no wonder there wa a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many thing to be thought of before the pequod wa fully equipped every one know what a multitude of thing bed sauce pan knife and fork shovel and tongs napkin nut cracker and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a three year housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocer costermonger doctor baker and banker and though this also hold true of merchant vessel yet not by any mean to the same extent a with whalemen for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous article peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbor usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ship whaling vessel are the most exposed to accident of all kind and especially to the destruction and loss of the very thing upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boat spare spar and spare line and harpoon and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoop and stave but a before hinted for some time there wa a continual fetching and carrying on board of diver odds and end of thing both large and small chief among those who did this fetching and carrying wa captain bildad s sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickle for the steward s pantry another time with a bunch of quill for the chief mate s desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one s rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which wa charity aunt charity a everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad wa concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of well saved dollar but it wa startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board a she did the last day with a long oil ladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor wa bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward a for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the article needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchway roaring up to the rigger at the mast head and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam during these day of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and a often i asked about captain ahab and how he wa and when he wa going to come on board his ship to these question they would answer that he wa getting better and better and wa expected aboard every day meantime the two captain peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eye on the man who wa to be the absolute dictator of it so soon a the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when a man suspect any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicion even from himself and much this way it wa with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing at last it wa given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start chapter going aboard it wa nearly six o clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf there are some sailor running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg it can t be shadow she s off by sunrise i guess come on avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind u laid a hand upon both our shoulder and then insinuating himself between u stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it wa elijah going aboard hand off will you said i lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way ain t going aboard then yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent no no no i wasn t aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glance elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we are going to the indian and pacific ocean and would prefer not to be detained ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast he s cracked queequeg said i come on holloa cried stationary elijah hailing u when we had removed a few pace never mind him said i queequeg come on but he stole up to u again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder said did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago struck by this plain matter of fact question i answered saying yes i thought i did see four or five men but it wa too dim to be sure very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after u and touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye find who morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i wa going to warn ye against but never mind never mind it s all one all in the family too sharp frost this morning ain t it good bye to ye shan t see ye again very soon i guess unless it s before the grand jury and with these cracked word he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance wa locked within the hatch were all on and lumbered with coil of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered pea jacket he wa thrown at whole length upon two chest his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arm the profoundest slumber slept upon him those sailor we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijah s otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleeper s rear a though feeling if it wa soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there gracious queequeg don t sit there said i oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way won t hurt him face face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes he s heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy it s grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look he ll twitch you off soon i wonder he don t wake queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the foot we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settee and sofa of all sort the king chief and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower order for ottoman and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellow and lay them round in the pier and alcove besides it wa very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden chair which are convertible into walking stick upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place while narrating these thing every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he flourished the hatchet side of it over the sleeper s head what s that for queequeg perry easy kill e oh perry easy he wa going on with some wild reminiscence about his tomahawk pipe which it seemed had in it two us both brained his foe and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eye holloa he breathed at last who be ye smoker shipped men answered i when doe she sail aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sail to day the captain came aboard last night what captain ahab who but him indeed i wa going to ask him some further question concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck holloa starbuck s astir said the rigger he s a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we followed it wa now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in two and three the rigger bestirred themselves the mate were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last thing on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin chapter merry christmas at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship s rigger and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the ever thoughtful charity had come off in a whale boat with her last gift a night cap for stubb the second mate her brother in law and a spare bible for the steward after all this the two captain peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is all ready just spoke to him nothing more to be got from shore eh well call all hand then muster em aft here blast em no need of profane word however great the hurry peleg said bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter deck just a if they were to be joint commander at sea a well a to all appearance in port and a for captain ahab no sign of him wa yet to be seen only they said he wa in the cabin but then the idea wa that his presence wa by no mean necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed a that wa not at all his proper business but the pilot s and a he wa not yet completely recovered so they said therefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially a in the merchant service many captain never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merry making with their shore friend before they quit the ship for good with the pilot but there wa not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg wa now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad aft here ye son of bachelor he cried a the sailor lingered at the main mast mr starbuck drive em aft strike the tent there wa the next order a i hinted before this whalebone marquee wa never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty year the order to strike the tent wa well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor man the capstan blood and thunder jump wa the next command and the crew sprang for the handspike now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officer wa one of the licensed pilot of the port he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ship he wa concerned in for he never piloted any other craft bildad i say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bow for the approaching anchor and at interval singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hand at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girl in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three day previous bildad had told them that no profane song would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watt in each seaman s berth meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the peril we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i wa comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventy seventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round wa horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that wa my first kick is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared spring thou sheep head spring and break thy backbone why don t ye spring i say all of ye spring quohog spring thou chap with the red whisker spring there scotch cap spring thou green pant spring i say all of ye and spring your eye out and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody think i captain peleg must have been drinking something to day at last the anchor wa up the sail were set and off we glided it wa a short cold christmas and a the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased u in ice a in polished armor the long row of teeth on the bulwark glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusk of some huge elephant vast curving icicle depended from the bow lank bildad a pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon a the old craft deep dived into the green sea and sent the shivering frost all over her and the wind howled and the cordage rang his steady note were heard sweet field beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to the jew old canaan stood while jordan rolled between never did those sweet word sound more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet foot and wetter jacket there wa yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and mead and glade so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing that the two pilot were needed no longer the stout sail boat that had accompanied u began ranging alongside it wa curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage beyond both stormy cape a ship in which some thousand of his hard earned dollar were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed a captain a man almost a old a he once more starting to encounter all the terror of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him poor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious stride ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless water only bounded by the far off unseen eastern continent looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon it pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face a much a to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can a for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there wa a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to deck now a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about him captain bildad come old shipmate we must go back the main yard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful careful come bildad boy say your last luck to ye starbuck luck to ye mr stubb luck to ye mr flask good bye and good luck to ye all and this day three year i ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently i hope ye ll have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he need and ye ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go be careful in the hunt ye mate don t stave the boat needlessly ye harpooneer good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year don t forget your prayer either mr starbuck mind that cooper don t waste the spare stave oh the sail needle are in the green locker don t whale it too much a lord s day men but don t miss a fair chance either that s rejecting heaven s good gift have an eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it wa a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the island mr flask beware of fornication good bye good bye don t keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr starbuck it ll spoil be careful with the butter twenty cent the pound it wa and mind ye if come come captain bildad stop palavering away and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hull wildly rolled we gave three heavy hearted cheer and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic chapter the lee shore some chapter back one bulkington wa spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn when on that shivering winter s night the pequod thrust her vindictive bow into the cold malicious wave who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in mid winter just landed from a four year dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his foot wonderfullest thing are ever the unmentionable deep memory yield no epitaph this six inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say that it fared with him a with the storm tossed ship that miserably drive along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blanket friend all that s kind to our mortality but in that gale the port the land is that ship s direst jeopardy she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowd all sail off shore in so doing fight gainst the very wind that fain would blow her homeward seek all the lashed sea s landlessness again for refuge s sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe know ye now bulkington glimpse do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest wind of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore but a in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite a god so better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for worm like then oh who would craven crawl to land terror of the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy ocean perishing straight up leap thy apotheosis chapter the advocate a queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and a this business of whaling ha somehow come to be regarded among landsman a a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsman of the injustice hereby done to u hunter of whale in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal profession if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merit were he presented to the company a a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officer he should append the initial s w f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed pre eminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world decline honoring u whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amount to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilement butcher we are that is true but butcher also and butcher of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commander whom the world invariably delight to honor and a for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain fact hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whale ship at least among the cleanliest thing of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery deck of a whale ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle field from which so many soldier return to drink in all lady plaudit and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier s profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who ha freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale s vast tail fanning into eddy the air over his head for what are the comprehensible terror of man compared with the interlinked terror and wonder of god but though the world scout at u whale hunter yet doe it unwittingly pay u the profoundest homage yea an all abounding adoration for almost all the taper lamp and candle that burn round the globe burn a before so many shrine to our glory but look at this matter in other light weigh it in all sort of scale see what we whalemen are and have been why did the dutch in de witt s time have admiral of their whaling fleet why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit out whaling ship from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of family from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the year and pay to her whalemen in bounty upwards of and lastly how come it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessel manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming of dollar the ship worth at the time of sailing and every year importing into our harbor a well reaped harvest of how come all this if there be not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half look again i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher can not for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty year ha operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and another it ha begotten event so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issue that whaling may well be regarded a that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these thing let a handful suffice for many year past the whale ship ha been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known part of the earth she ha explored sea and archipelago which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if american and european men of war now peacefully ride in once savage harbor let them fire salute to the honor and glory of the whale ship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savage they may celebrate a they will the hero of exploring expedition your cook your krusensterns but i say that score of anonymous captain have sailed out of nantucket that were a great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless empty handedness they in the heathenish sharked water and by the beach of unrecorded javelin island battled with virgin wonder and terror that cook with all his marine and musket would not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyage those thing were but the life time commonplace of our heroic nantucketers often adventure which vancouver dedicates three chapter to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship s common log ah the world oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial wa carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish province on the pacific coast it wa the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those colony and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those part that great america on the other side of the sphere australia wa given to the enlightened world by the whaleman after it first blunder born discovery by a dutchman all other ship long shunned those shore a pestiferously barbarous but the whale ship touched there the whale ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrant were several time saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their water the uncounted isle of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale ship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many case carried the primitive missionary to their first destination if that double bolted land japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling ha no sthetically noble association connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lance with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time the whale ha no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a whaling voyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the word from other the norwegian whale hunter of those time and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devil they have no good blood in their vein no good blood in their vein they have something better than royal blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin wa mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settler of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneer all kith and kin to noble benjamin this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old english statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish oh that s only nominal the whale himself ha never figured in any grand imposing way the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty triumph given to a roman general upon his entering the world s capital the bone of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession see subsequent chapter for something more on this head grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heaven attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in his lifetime ha taken three hundred and fifty whale i account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking a many walled town and a for me if by any possibility there be any a yet undiscovered prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone if at my death my executor or more properly my creditor find any precious ms in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling for a whale ship wa my yale college and my harvard chapter postscript in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated fact but after embattling his fact an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his cause such an advocate would he not be blameworthy it is well known that at the coronation of king and queen even modern one a certain curious process of seasoning them for their function is gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state how they use the salt precisely who know certain i am however that a king s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even a a head of salad can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making it interior run well a they anoint machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smell of that anointing in truth a mature man who us hair oil unless medicinally that man ha probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere a a general rule he can t amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here is this what kind of oil is used at coronation certainly it can not be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bear s oil nor train oil nor cod liver oil what then can it possibly be but sperm oil in it unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oil think of that ye loyal briton we whalemen supply your king and queen with coronation stuff chapter knight and squire the chief mate of the pequod wa starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he wa a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitude his flesh being hard a twice baked biscuit transported to the indie his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast day for which his state is famous only some thirty arid summer had he seen those summer had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxiety and care than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it wa merely the condensation of the man he wa by no mean ill looking quite the contrary his pure tight skin wa an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long age to come and to endure always a now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality wa warranted to do well in all climate looking into his eye you seemed to see there the yet lingering image of those thousand fold peril he had calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part wa a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sound yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain quality in him which at time affected and in some case seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organization seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portent and inward presentiment were his and if at time these thing bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his far away domestic memory of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influence which in some honest hearted men restrain the gush of dare devil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitude of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage wa that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is a careful a man a you ll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely mean when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck wa no crusader after peril in him courage wa not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasion besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage wa one of the great staple outfit of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whale after sun down nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whale for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundred of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom wa his own father s where in the bottomless deep could he find the torn limb of his brother with memory like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness a ha been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it wa not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experience and remembrance a he had it wa not in nature that these thing should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstance would break out from it confinement and burn all his courage up and brave a he might be it wa that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with sea or wind or whale or any of the ordinary irrational horror of the world yet can not withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terror which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbuck s fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable a joint stock company and nation knave fool and murderer there may be men may have mean and meagre face but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellow should run to throw their costliest robe that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within u that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor ruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraiding against the permitting star but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of king and robe but that abounding dignity which ha no robed investiture thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drive a spike that democratic dignity which on all hand radiates without end from god himself the great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy his omnipresence our divine equality if then to meanest mariner and renegade and castaway i shall hereafter ascribe high quality though dark weave round them tragic grace if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at time lift himself to the exalted mount if i shall touch that workman s arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critic bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaf of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebble who didst hurl him upon a war horse who didst thunder him higher than a throne thou who in all thy mighty earthly marching ever cullest thy selectest champion from the kingly common bear me out in it o god chapter knight and squire stubb wa the second mate he wa a native of cape cod and hence according to local usage wa called a cape cod man a happy go lucky neither craven nor valiant taking peril a they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected a a journeyman joiner engaged for the year good humored easy and careless he presided over his whale boat a if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guest he wa a particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat a an old stage driver is about the snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off handedly a a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tune while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaw of death into an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner what perhaps with other thing made stubb such an easy going unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlar all bowed to the ground with their pack what helped to bring about that almost impious good humor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black little pipe wa one of the regular feature of his face you would almost a soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose a without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipe there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his leg into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one know that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless misery of the numberless mortal who have died exhaling it and a in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouth so likewise against all mortal tribulation stubb s tobacco smoke might have operated a a sort of disinfecting agent the third mate wa flask a native of tisbury in martha s vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whale who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathan had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it wa a sort of point of honor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost wa he to all sense of reverence for the many marvel of their majestic bulk and mystic way and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale wa but a specie of magnified mouse or at least water rat requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whale he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three year voyage round cape horn wa only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time a a carpenter s nail are divided into wrought nail and cut nail so mankind may be similarly divided little flask wa one of the wrought one made to clinch tight and last long they called him king post on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic whaler and which by the mean of many radiating side timber inserted into it serf to brace the ship against the icy concussion of those battering sea now these three mate starbuck stubb and flask were momentous men they it wa who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod s boat a headsman in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his force to descend on the whale these three headsman were a captain of company or being armed with their long keen whaling spear they were a a picked trio of lancer even a the harpooneer were flingers of javelin and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by his boat steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjuncture provides him with a fresh lance when the former one ha been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover a there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the pequod s harpooneer were and to what headsman each of them belonged first of all wa queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire but queequeg is already known next wa tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of martha s vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which ha long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneer in the fishery they usually go by the generic name of gay header tashtego s long lean sable hair his high cheek bone and black rounding eye for an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their glittering expression all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunter who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forest of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beast of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whale of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sire to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limb you would almost have credited the superstition of some of the earlier puritan and half believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the power of the air tashtego wa stubb the second mate s squire third among the harpooneer wa daggoo a gigantic coal black negro savage with a lion like tread an ahasuerus to behold suspended from his ear were two golden hoop so large that the sailor called them ring bolt and would talk of securing the top sail halyard to them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbor most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many year the bold life of the fishery in the ship of owner uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtue and erect a a giraffe moved about the deck in all the pomp of six foot five in his sock there wa a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo wa the squire of little flask who looked like a chess man beside him a for the residue of the pequod s company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery are american born though pretty nearly all the officer are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery a with the american army and military and merchant navy and the engineering force employed in the construction of the american canal and railroad the same i say because in all these case the native american liberally provides the brain the rest of the world a generously supplying the muscle no small number of these whaling seaman belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whaler frequently touch to augment their crew from the hardy peasant of those rocky shore in like manner the greenland whaler sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland island to receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but islander seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islander in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isle of the sea and all the end of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the world s grievance before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back black little pip he never did oh no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim pequod s forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarter deck on high he wa bid strike in with angel and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there chapter ahab for several day after leaving nantucket nothing above hatch wa seen of captain ahab the mate regularly relieved each other at the watch and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commander of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with order so sudden and peremptory that after all it wa plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator wa there though hitherto unseen by any eye not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my watch below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation this wa strangely heightened at time by the ragged elijah s diabolical incoherence uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of but poorly could i withstand them much a in other mood i wa almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicality of that outlandish prophet of the wharf but whatever it wa of apprehensiveness or uneasiness to call it so which i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotion for though the harpooneer with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchant ship company which my previous experience had made me acquainted with still i ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it wa especially the aspect of the three chief officer of the ship the mate which wa most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgiving and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely sea officer and men each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every one of them american a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all it intolerable weather behind u it wa one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough morning of the transition when with a fair wind the ship wa rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that a i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon a i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shiver ran over me reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarter deck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire ha overrunningly wasted all the limb without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cellini s cast perseus threading it way out from among his grey hair and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rod like mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly dart down it and without wrenching a single twig peel and groove out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded whether that mark wa born with him or whether it wa the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion wa made to it especially by the mate but once tashtego s senior an old gay head indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he wa full forty year old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old sea tradition the immemorial credulity popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural power of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid out which might hardly come to pas so he muttered then whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birth mark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moment i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness wa owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale s jaw aye he wa dismasted off japan said the old gay head indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it he ha a quiver of em i wa struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of the pequod s quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shroud there wa an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ship s ever pitching prow there wa an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his officer say aught to him though by all their minutest gesture and expression they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled master eye and not only that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he wa every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivot hole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck a the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse a if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pas that he wa almost continually in the air but a yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed a unnecessary there a another mast but the pequod wa only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mate were fully competent to so that there wa little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the cloud that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow a ever all cloud choose the loftiest peak to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood for a when the red cheeked dancing girl april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic wood even the barest ruggedest most thunder cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprout to welcome such glad hearted visitant so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile chapter enter ahab to him stubb some day elapsed and ice and iceberg all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reign on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant day were a crystal goblet of persian sherbet heaped up flaked up with rose water snow the starred and stately night seemed haughty dame in jewelled velvet nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earl the golden helmeted sun for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome day and such seducing night but all the witchery of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spell and potency to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hour of eve came on then memory shot her crystal a the clear ice most form of noiseless twilight and all these subtle agency more and more they wrought on ahab s texture old age is always wakeful a if the longer linked with life the less man ha to do with aught that look like death among sea commander the old greybeard will oftenest leave their berth to visit the night cloaked deck it wa so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visit were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the plank it feel like going down into one s tomb he would mutter to himself for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my grave dug berth so almost every twenty four hour when the watch of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumber of the band below and when if a rope wa to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailor flung it not rudely down a by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to it place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmate when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considering touch of humanity wa in him for at time like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter deck because to his wearied mate seeking repose within six inch of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dream would have been on the crunching teeth of shark but once the mood wa on him too deep for common regardings and a with heavy lumber like pace he wa measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab wa pleased to walk the plank then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then am i a cannon ball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy way i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such a ye sleep between shroud to use ye to the filling one at last down dog and kennel starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb wa speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir avast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away a if to avoid some passionate temptation no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely be called a dog sir then be called ten time a donkey and a mule and an as and begone or i ll clear the world of thee a he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terror in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated i wa never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb a he found himself descending the cabin scuttle it s very queer stop stubb somehow now i don t well know whether to go back and strike him or what s that down here on my knee and pray for him yes that wa the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray it s queer very queer and he s queer too aye take him fore and aft he s about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at me his eye like powder pan is he mad anyway there s something on his mind a sure a there must be something on a deck when it crack he aint in his bed now either more than three hour out of the twenty four and he don t sleep then didn t that dough boy the steward tell me that of a morning he always find the old man s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheet down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knot and the pillow a sort of frightful hot a though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess he s got what some folk ashore call a conscience it s a kind of tic dolly row they say worse nor a toothache well well i don t know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it he s full of riddle i wonder what he go into the after hold for every night a dough boy tell me he suspect what s that for i should like to know who s made appointment with him in the hold ain t that queer now but there s no telling it s the old game here go for a snooze damn me it s worth a fellow s while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it that s about the first thing baby do and that s a sort of queer too damn me but all thing are queer come to think of em but that s against my principle think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfth so here go again but how s that didn t he call me a dog blaze he called me ten time a donkey and piled a lot of jackass on top of that he might a well have kicked me and done with it maybe he did kick me and i didn t observe it i wa so taken all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the devil s the matter with me i don t stand right on my leg coming afoul of that old man ha a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming though how how how but the only way s to stash it so here go to hammock again and in the morning i ll see how this plaguey juggling think over by daylight chapter the pipe when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwark and then a had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked in old norse time the throne of the sea loving danish king were fabricated saith tradition of the tusk of the narwhale how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bone without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathan wa ahab some moment passed during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puff which blew back again into his face how now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuring aye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiff a if like the dying whale my final jet were the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapor among mild white hair not among torn iron grey lock like mine i ll smoke no more he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the wave the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the plank chapter queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask such a queer dream king post i never had you know the old man s ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what wa still more curious flask you know how curious all dream are through all this rage that i wa in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it wa not much of an insult that kick from ahab why think i what s the row it s not a real leg only a false leg and there s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump that s what make a blow from the hand flask fifty time more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living member that make the living insult my little man and think i to myself all the while mind while i wa stubbing my silly toe against that cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory wa it all all the while i say i wa thinking to myself what s his leg now but a cane a whalebone cane yes think i it wa only a playful cudgelling in fact only a whaleboning that he gave me not a base kick besides think i look at it once why the end of it the foot part what a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me there s a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only but now come the greatest joke of the dream flask while i wa battering away at the pyramid a sort of badger haired old merman with a hump on his back take me by the shoulder and slew me round what are you bout say he slid man but i wa frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i wa over the fright what am i about say i at last and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout what do you think i saw why thunder alive man his stern wa stuck full of marlinspike with the point out say i on second thought i guess i won t kick you old fellow wise stubb said he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gum like a chimney hag seeing he wasn t going to stop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might a well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa say i what s the matter now old fellow look ye here say he let s argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didn t he yes he did say i right here it wa very good say he he used his ivory leg didn t he yes he did say i well then say he wise stubb what have you to complain of didn t he kick with right good will it wasn t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with wa it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb it s an honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old england the greatest lord think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garter knight of but be your boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say be kicked by him account his kick honor and on no account kick back for you can t help yourself wise stubb don t you see that pyramid with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i wa in my hammock now what do you think of that dream flask i don t know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho may be may be but it s made a wise man of me flask d ye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he say halloa what s that he shout hark mast head there look sharp all of ye there are whale hereabouts if ye see a white one split your lung for him what do you think of that now flask ain t there a small drop of something queer about that eh a white whale did ye mark that man look ye there s something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab ha that that s bloody on his mind but mum he come this way chapter cetology already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in it unshored harbourless immensity ere that come to pas ere the pequod s weedy hull roll side by side with the barnacled hull of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelation and allusion of all sort which are to follow it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genus that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the classification of the constituent of a chaos nothing less is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authority have laid down no branch of zoology is so much involved a that which is entitled cetology say captain scoresby a d it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry a to the true method of dividing the cetacea into group and family utter confusion exists among the historian of this animal sperm whale say surgeon beale a d unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable water impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field strewn with thorn all these incomplete indication but serve to torture u naturalist thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those light of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of book there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whale many are the men small and great old and new landsman and seaman who have at large or in little written of the whale run over a few the author of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linn u rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lac p de bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extract will show of the name in this list of whale author only those following owen ever saw living whale and but one of them wa a real professional harpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or right whale he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and say nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the sea he is not even by any mean the largest of the whale yet owing to the long priority of his claim and the profound ignorance which till some seventy year back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale and which ignorance to this present day still reign in all but some few scientific retreat and whale port this usurpation ha been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusion in the great poet of past day will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival wa to them the monarch of the sea but the time ha at last come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people all the greenland whale is deposed the great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two book in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those book are beale s and bennett s both in their time surgeon to english south sea whale ship and both exact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volume is necessarily small but so far a it go it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description a yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic life not complete in any literature far above all other hunted whale his is an unwritten life now the various specie of whale need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all it department by subsequent laborer a no better man advance to take this matter in hand i hereupon offer my own poor endeavor i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various specie or in this place at least to much of any description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder but it is a ponderous task no ordinary letter sorter in the post office is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have one s hand among the unspeakable foundation rib and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful taunting in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through library and sailed through ocean i have had to do with whale with these visible hand i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminary to settle first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarter it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of nature a d linn u declares i hereby separate the whale from the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year shark and shad alewife and herring against linn u s express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same sea with the leviathan the ground upon which linn u would fain have banished the whale from the water he state a follows on account of their warm bilocular heart their lung their movable eyelid their hollow ear penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege natur jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friend simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmate of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reason set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect doe the whale differ from other fish above linn u ha given you those item but in brief they are these lung and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next how shall we define the whale by his obvious external so a conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail there you have him however contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation a walrus spout much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is still more cogent a coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsman have not a flat but a vertical or up and down tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no mean exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded a alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology now then come the grand division of the entire whale host i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and dugong pig fish and sow fish of the coffin of nantucket are included by many naturalist among the whale but a these pig fish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouth of river and feeding on wet hay and especially a they do not spout i deny their credential a whale and have presented them with their passport to quit the kingdom of cetology first according to magnitude i divide the whale into three primary book subdivisible into chapter and these shall comprehend them all both small and large i the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale a the type of the folio i present the sperm whale of the octavo the grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise folio among these i here include the following chapter i the sperm whale ii the right whale iii the fin back whale iv the hump backed whale v the razor back whale vi the sulphur bottom whale book i folio chapter i sperm whale this whale among the english of old vaguely known a the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the german and the macrocephalus of the long word he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whale to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarity will in many other place be enlarged upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it is absurd some century ago when the sperm whale wa almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil wa only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those day spermaceti it would seem wa popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england a the greenland or right whale it wa the idea also that this same spermaceti wa that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally express in those time also spermaceti wa exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only a an ointment and medicament it wa only to be had from the druggist a you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when a i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known it original name wa still retained by the dealer no doubt to enhance it value by a notion so strangely significant of it scarcity and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti wa really derived book i folio chapter ii right whale in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathan being the one first regularly hunted by man it yield the article commonly known a whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known a whale oil an inferior article in commerce among the fisherman he is indiscriminately designated by all the following title the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the specie thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in the second specie of my folio it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalist the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swede it is the whale which for more than two century past ha been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic sea it is the whale which the american fisherman have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil bank on the nor west coast and various other part of the world designated by them right whale cruising ground some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the american but they precisely agree in all their grand feature nor ha there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivision based upon the most inconclusive difference that some department of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale book i folio chapter iii fin back under this head i reckon a monster which by the various name of fin back tall spout and long john ha been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passenger crossing the atlantic in the new york packet track in the length he attains and in his baleen the fin back resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lip present a cable like aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting fold of large wrinkle his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some three or four foot long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at time be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripple and this gnomon like fin stand up and cast shadow upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with it style and wavy hour line graved on it on that ahaz dial the shadow often go back the fin back is not gregarious he seems a whale hater a some men are man hater very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen water his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming a to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the fin back is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic specie denominated whalebone whale that is whale with baleen of these so called whalebone whale there would seem to be several variety most of which however are little known broad nosed whale and beaked whale pike headed whale bunched whale under jawed whale and rostrated whale are the fisherman s name for a few sort in connection with this appellative of whalebone whale it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusion to some kind of whale yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked part or feature very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinction which the whale in his kind present how then the baleen hump back fin and teeth these are thing whose peculiarity are indiscriminately dispersed among all sort of whale without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particular thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each ha a hump but there the similitude cease then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these ha baleen but there again the similitude cease and it is just the same with the other part above mentioned in various sort of whale they form such irregular combination or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation a utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the whale naturalist ha split but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal part of the whale in his anatomy there at least we shall be able to hit the right classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whale s anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowel of the various leviathan why there you will not find distinction a fiftieth part a available to the systematizer a those external one already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whale bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed book i folio chapter iv hump back this whale is often seen on the northern american coast he ha been frequently captured there and towed into harbor he ha a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular name for him doe not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also ha a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he ha baleen he is the most gamesome and light hearted of all the whale making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them book i folio chapter v razor back of this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunter and philosopher though no coward he ha never yet shown any part of him but his back which rise in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor doe anybody else book i folio chapter vi sulphur bottom another retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tile in some of his profounder diving he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern sea and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is never chased he would run away with rope walk of line prodigy are told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer thus end book i folio and now begin book ii octavo octavoes these embrace the whale of middling magnitude among which present may be numbered i the grampus ii the black fish iii the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killer why this book of whale is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while the whale of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinder s quarto volume in it dimensioned form doe not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume doe book ii octavo chapter i grampus though this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing ha furnished a proverb to landsman is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whale but possessing all the grand distinctive feature of the leviathan most naturalist have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twenty five foot in length and of corresponding dimension round the waist he swim in herd he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some fisherman his approach is regarded a premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale book ii octavo chapter ii black fish i give the popular fisherman s name for all these fish for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish so called because blackness is the rule among almost all whale so call him the hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angle of his lip are curved upwards he carry an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale average some sixteen or eighteen foot in length he is found in almost all latitude he ha a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which look something like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunter sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment a some frugal housekeeper in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whale will yield you upwards of thirty gallon of oil book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostril whale another instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen foot in length while it horn average five foot though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen foot strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found on the sinister side which ha an ill effect giving it owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left handed man what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answer it would be hard to say it doe not seem to be used like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailor tell me that the narwhale employ it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin said it wa used for an ice piercer for the narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrust his horn up and so break through but you can not prove either of these surmise to be correct my own opinion is that however this one sided horn may really be used by the narwhale however that may be it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlet the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old author i have gathered that this same sea unicorn s horn wa in ancient day regarded a the great antidote against poison and a such preparation of it brought immense price it wa also distilled to a volatile salt for fainting lady the same way that the horn of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it wa in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tell me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace a his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knee he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knee did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature the narwhale ha a very picturesque leopard like look being of a milk white ground colour dotted with round and oblong spot of black his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar sea book ii octavo chapter iv killer of this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he wa about the bigness of a grampus he is very savage a sort of feegee fish he sometimes take the great folio whale by the lip and hang there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he ha exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of it indistinctness for we are all killer on land and on sea bonaparte and shark included book ii octavo chapter v thrasher this gentleman is famous for his tail which he us for a ferule in thrashing his foe he mount the folio whale s back and a he swim he work his passage by flogging him a some schoolmaster get along in the world by a similar process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaw even in the lawless sea thus end book ii octavo and begin book iii duodecimo duodecimoes these include the smaller whale i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy mouthed porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fish not commonly exceeding four or five foot should be marshalled among whale a word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creature set down above a duodecimoes are infallibly whale by the term of my definition of what a whale is i e a spouting fish with a horizontal tail book iii duodecimo chapter huzza porpoise this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoise and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always swim in hilarious shoal which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like cap in a fourth of july crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine spirit they invariably come from the breezy billow to windward they are the lad that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheer at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a well fed plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaw is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jeweller and watchmaker sailor put it on their hone porpoise meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spout indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise a pirate very savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many time but never yet saw him captured book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealy mouthed porpoise the largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far a it is known the only english name by which he ha hitherto been designated is that of the fisher right whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentleman like figure he ha no fin on his back most other porpoise have he ha a lovely tail and sentimental indian eye of a hazel hue but his mealy mouth spoil all though his entire back down to his side fin is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct a the mark in a ship s hull called the bright waist that line streak him from stem to stern with two separate colour black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which make him look a if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal bag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise beyond the duodecimo this system doe not proceed inasmuch a the porpoise is the smallest of the whale above you have all the leviathan of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive half fabulous whale which a an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their fore castle appellation for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigator who may complete what i have here but begun if any of the following whale shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitude the bottle nose whale the junk whale the pudding headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authority there might be quoted other list of uncertain whale blessed with all manner of uncouth name but i omit them a altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sound full of leviathanism but signifying nothing finally it wa stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected you can not but plainly see that i have kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even a the great cathedral of cologne wa left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small erection may be finished by their first architect grand one true one ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing anything this whole book is but a draught nay but the draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience chapter the specksnyder concerning the officer of the whale craft this seems a good a place a any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship board arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officer a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale fleet the large importance attached to the harpooneer s vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two century and more ago the command of a whale ship wa not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but wa divided between him and an officer called the specksnyder literally this word mean fat cutter usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in those day the captain s authority wa restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whale hunting department and all it concern the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he rank simply a senior harpooneer and a such is but one of the captain s more inferior subaltern nevertheless a upon the good conduct of the harpooneer the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstance night watch on a whaling ground the command of the ship s deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demand that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished a their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded a their social equal now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is this the first life aft the last forward hence in whale ship and merchantman alike the mate have their quarter with the captain and so too in most of the american whaler the harpooneer are lodged in the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meal in the captain s cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyage now or ever made by man the peculiar peril of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their profit not upon fixed wage but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these thing do in some case tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantman generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instance live together for all that the punctilious external at least of the quarter deck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ship in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost a much outward homage a if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot cloth and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod wa the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted wa implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoe from his foot ere stepping upon the quarter deck and though there were time when owing to peculiar circumstance connected with event hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual term whether of condescension or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab wa by no mean unobservant of the paramount form and usage of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those form and usage a it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private end than they were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those form that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship for be a man s intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external art and entrenchment always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever keep god s true prince of the empire from the world s hustings and leaf the highest honor that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small thing when extreme political superstition invest them that in some royal instance even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency but when a in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herd crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in it fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art a the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still move before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperor and king i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale hunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trapping and housing are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it must need be plucked at from the sky and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air chapter the cabin table it is noon and dough boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf of bread face from the cabin scuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarter boat ha just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shroud he swing himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr starbuck disappears into the cabin when the last echo of his sultan s step ha died away and starbuck the first emir ha every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rous from his quietude take a few turn along the plank and after a grave peep into the binnacle say with some touch of pleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounge about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise take up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessor but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarter deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sort of knowing wink in all sort of direction and kicking off his shoe he strike into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk s head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he go down rollicking so far at least a he remains visible from the deck reversing all other procession by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pause ship a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahab s presence in the character of abjectus or the slave it is not the least among the strange thing bred by the intense artificialness of sea usage that while in the open air of the deck some officer will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officer the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander s cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him a he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner table of invited guest that man s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that man s royalty of state transcends belshazzar s for belshazzar wa not the greatest who ha but once dined his friend ha tasted what it is to be c sar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship master then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea life just mentioned over his ivory inlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sea lion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cub in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served they were a little child before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eye all fastened upon the old man s knife a he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic a the weather no and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef wa locked ahab thereby motioned starbuck s plate towards him the mate received his meat a though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial elector so these cabin meal were somehow solemn meal eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself wa dumb what a relief it wa to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he wa the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shinbone of the saline beef his would have been the drumstick for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chance were ahab had never so much a noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owner of the ship denied it to him on account of it clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless water butter wa at a premium and therefore wa not for him a subaltern however it wa flask ala wa a butterless man another thing flask wa the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up consider for hereby flask s dinner wa badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon show symptom of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthful that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it wa that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it wa to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger a keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of old fashioned beef in the forecastle a i used to when i wa before the mast there s the fruit of promotion now there s the vanity of glory there s the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask s official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance wa to go aft at dinner time and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky light sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab now ahab and his three mate formed what may be called the first table in the pequod s cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth wa cleared or rather wa restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneer were bidden to the feast they being it residuary legatee they made a sort of temporary servant hall of the high and mighty cabin in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain s table wa the entire care free license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellow the harpooneer while their master the mate seemed afraid of the sound of the hinge of their own jaw the harpooneer chewed their food with such a relish that there wa a report to it they dined like lord they filled their belly like indian ship all day loading with spice such portentous appetite had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancy made by the previous repast often the pale dough boy wa fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hop skip and jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoon wise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted dough boy s memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he wa naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this bread faced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitation of these three savage dough boy s whole life wa one continual lip quiver commonly after seeing the harpooneer furnished with all thing they demanded he would escape from their clutch into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blind of it door till all wa over it wa a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indian s crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limb making the low cabin framework to shake a when an african elephant go passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro wa wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthful he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostril snuffed in the sublime life of the world not by beef or by bread are giant made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough so much so that the trembling dough boy almost looked to see whether any mark of teeth lurked in his own lean arm and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bone might be picked the simple witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fit of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneer carried in their pocket for their lance and other weapon and with which whetstone at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knife that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy how could he forget that in his island day queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretion ala dough boy hard fare the white waiter who wait upon cannibal not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three salt sea warrior would rise and depart to his credulous fable mongering ear all their martial bone jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbard but though these barbarian dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habit they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtime and just before sleeping time when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarter in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captain who a a set rather incline to the opinion that by right the ship s cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mate and harpooneer of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it wa something a a street door enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and a a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin wa no companionship socially ahab wa inaccessible though nominally included in the census of christendom he wa still an alien to it he lived in the world a the last of the grisly bear lived in settled missouri and a when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the wood burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paw so in his inclement howling old age ahab s soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paw of it gloom chapter the mast head it wa during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seaman my first mast head came round in most american whalemen the mast head are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel s leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand mile and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three four or five year voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her say an empty vial even then her mast head are kept manned to the last and not till her skysail pole sail in among the spire of the port doe she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more now a the business of standing mast head ashore or afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let u in some measure expatiate here i take it that the earliest stander of mast head were the old egyptian because in all my research i find none prior to them for though their progenitor the builder of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest mast head in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck wa put to it a that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of god s wrath therefore we can not give these babel builder priority over the egyptian and that the egyptian were a nation of mast head stander is an assertion based upon the general belief among arch ologists that the first pyramid were founded for astronomical purpose a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair like formation of all four side of those edifice whereby with prodigious long uplifting of their leg those old astronomer were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new star even a the look out of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylite the famous christian hermit of old time who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on it summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander of mast head who wa not to be driven from his place by fog or frost rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post of modern stander of mast head we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stand with arm folded some one hundred and fifty foot in the air careless now who rule the deck below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stand high aloft on his towering main mast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillar his column mark that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortal will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun metal stand his mast head in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsel the distracted deck upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirit penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoal and what rock must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast head stander of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stand accountable the worthy obed tell u that in the early time of the whale fishery ere ship were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spar along the sea coast to which the look out ascended by mean of nailed cleat something a fowl go upstairs in a hen house a few year ago this same plan wa adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the ready manned boat nigh the beach but this custom ha now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper mast head that of a whale ship at sea the three mast head are kept manned from sun rise to sun set the seaman taking their regular turn a at the helm and relieving each other every two hour in the serene weather of the tropic it is exceedingly pleasant the mast head nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred foot above the silent deck striding along the deep a if the mast were gigantic stilt while beneath you and between your leg a it were swim the hugest monster of the sea even a ship once sailed between the boot of the famous colossus at old rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the wave the tranced ship indolently roll the drowsy trade wind blow everything resolve you into languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazette extra with startling account of commonplace never delude you into unnecessary excitement you hear of no domestic affliction bankrupt security fall of stock are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner for all your meal for three year and more are snugly stowed in cask and your bill of fare is immutable in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four year voyage a often happens the sum of the various hour you spend at the mast head would amount to several entire month and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such a pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivance in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallant mast where you stand upon two thin parallel stick almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallant cross tree here tossed about by the sea the beginner feel about a cosy a he would standing on a bull s horn to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watch coat but properly speaking the thickest watch coat is no more of a house than the unclad body for a the soul is glued inside of it fleshy tabernacle and can not freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alp in winter so a watch coat is not so much of a house a it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you can not put a shelf or chest of drawer in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch coat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast head of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tent or pulpit called crow s nest in which the look out of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen sea in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the iceberg in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the re discovery of the lost icelandic colony of old greenland in this admirable volume all stander of mast head are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow s nest of the glacier which wa the name of captain sleet s good craft he called it the sleet s crow s nest in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own child after our own name we father being the original inventor and patentee so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the sleet s crow s nest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable side screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little trap hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrella comforter and coat in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical convenience when captain sleet in person stood his mast head in this crow s nest of his he tell u that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhale or vagrant sea unicorn infesting those water for you can not successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it wa plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe a he doe all the little detailed convenience of his crow s nest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treat u to a very scientific account of his experiment in this crow s nest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the error resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnet an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship s plank and in the glacier s case perhaps to there having been so many broken down blacksmith among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviation azimuth compass observation and approximate error he know very well captain sleet that he wa not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditation a to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case bottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow s nest within easy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case bottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with mittened finger and hooded head he wa studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird s nest within three or four perch of the pole but if we southern whale fisher are not so snugly housed aloft a captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counter balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive sea in which we south fisher mostly float for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pasture and so at last mount to my ultimate destination let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could i being left completely to myself at such a thought engendering altitude how could i but lightly hold my obligation to observe all whale ship standing order keep your weather eye open and sing out every time and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye ship owner of nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fishery any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offer to ship with the ph don instead of bowditch in his head beware of such an one i say your whale must be seen before they can be killed and this sunken eyed young platonist will tow you ten wake round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these monition at all unneeded for nowadays the whale fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent minded young men disgusted with the carking care of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perch himself upon the mast head of some luckless disappointed whale ship and in moody phrase ejaculate roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubber hunter sweep over thee in vain very often do the captain of such ship take those absent minded young philosopher to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage half hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition a that in their secret soul they would rather not see whale than otherwise but all in vain those young platonist have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are short sighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have left their opera glass at home why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lad we ve been cruising now hard upon three year and thou hast not raised a whale yet whale are scarce a hen s teeth whenever thou art up here perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoal of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opium like listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absent minded youth by the blending cadence of wave with thought that at last he loses his identity take the mystic ocean at his foot for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange half seen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimly discovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thought that only people the soul by continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebb away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like cranmer s sprinkled pantheistic ash forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tide of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity come back in horror over descartian vortex you hover and perhaps at mid day in the fairest weather with one half throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheist chapter the quarter deck enter ahab then all it wa not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab a wa his wont ascended the cabin gangway to the deck there most sea captain usually walk at that hour a country gentleman after the same meal take a few turn in the garden soon his steady ivory stride wa heard a to and fro he paced his old round upon plank so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stone with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger foot print the foot print of his one unsleeping ever pacing thought but on the occasion in question those dent looked deeper even a his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought wa ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the main mast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him a he turned and pace in him a he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement d ye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick that s in him peck the shell twill soon be out the hour wore on ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwark and inserting his bone leg into the auger hole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship board except in some extraordinary case send everybody aft repeated ahab mast head there come down when the entire ship s company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive face were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwark and then darting his eye among the crew started from his standpoint and a though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turn upon the deck with bent head and half slouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried what do ye do when ye see a whale men sing out for him wa the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voice good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tone observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them and what do ye next men lower away and after him and what tune is it ye pull to men a dead whale or a stove boat more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariner began to gaze curiously at each other a if marvelling how it wa that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless question but they were all eagerness again a ahab now half revolving in his pivot hole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus all ye mast header have before now heard me give order about a white whale look ye d ye see this spanish ounce of gold holding up a broad bright coin to the sun it is a sixteen dollar piece men d ye see it mr starbuck hand me yon top maul while the mate wa getting the hammer ahab without speaking wa slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirt of his jacket a if to heighten it lustre and without using any word wa meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheel of his vitality in him receiving the top maul from starbuck he advanced towards the main mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raise me a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raise me that white headed whale with three hole punctured in his starboard fluke look ye whosoever of ye raise me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boy huzza huzza cried the seaman a with swinging tarpaulin they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast it s a white whale i say resumed ahab a he threw down the topmaul a white whale skin your eye for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started a if each wa separately touched by some specific recollection captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash doe he fan tail a little curious sir before he go down said the gay header deliberately and ha he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab and he have one two three oh good many iron in him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twiske tee be twisk like him him faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round a though uncorking a bottle like him him corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoon lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white a a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep shearing aye tashtego and he fan tail like a split jib in a squall death and devil men it is moby dick ye have seen moby dick moby dick captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain ahab i have heard of moby dick but it wa not moby dick that took off thy leg who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it wa moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart stricken moose aye aye it wa that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arm with measureless imprecation he shouted out aye aye and i ll chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition s flame before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both side of land and over all side of earth till he spout black blood and roll fin out what say ye men will ye splice hand on it now i think ye do look brave aye aye shouted the harpooneer and seaman running closer to the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but what s this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for moby dick i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaw of death too captain ahab if it fairly come in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whale not my commander s vengeance how many barrel will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if money s to be the measurer man and the accountant have computed their great counting house the globe by girdling it with guinea one to every three part of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here he smites his chest whispered stubb what s that for methinks it ring most vast but hollow vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous hark ye yet again the little lower layer all visible object man are but a pasteboard mask but in each event in the living act the undoubted deed there some unknown but still reasoning thing put forth the moulding of it feature from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think there s naught beyond but ti enough he task me he heap me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy man i d strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creation but not my master man is even that fair play who s over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye more intolerable than fiend glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat ha melted thee to anger glow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm word are small indignity i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheek of spotted tawn living breathing picture painted by the sun the pagan leopard the unrecking and unworshipping thing that live and seek and give no reason for the torrid life

shot from my dilated nostril he ha inhaled it in his lung starbuck now is mine can not oppose me now without rebellion god keep me keep u all murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibration of the wind in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sail against the mast a for a moment their heart sank in for again starbuck s downcast eye lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the wind blew on the sail filled out the ship heaved and rolled a before ah ye admonition and warning why stay ye not when ye come but rather are ye prediction than warning ye shadow yet not so much prediction from without a verification of the foregoing thing within for with little external to constrain u the innermost necessity in our being these still drive u on the measure the measure cried ahab receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneer he ordered them to produce their weapon then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoon in their hand while his three mate stood at his side with their lance and the rest of the ship s company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eye met his a the bloodshot eye of the

advance ye mate cross your lance full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the three level radiating lance at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed a though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life the three mate quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of

of the dread in my soul a wild mystical sympathetical feeling wa in me ahab s quenchless feud seemed mine with greedy ear i learned the history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oath of violence and revenge for some time past though at interval only the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized sea mostly frequented by the sperm whale fisherman but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who a yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him wa small indeed for owing to the large number of whale cruiser the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitude so a seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single news telling sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the time of sailing from home all these with other circumstance direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole world wide whaling fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it wa hardly to be doubted that several vessel reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailant had completely escaped them to some mind it wa not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick yet a of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instance of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore it wa that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunter perhaps for the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more a it were to the peril of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and a for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost a boldly and fearlessly lowered for him a for any other whale of that specie but at length such calamity did ensue in these assault not restricted to sprained wrist and ankle broken limb or devouring amputation but fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulse all accumulating and piling their terror upon moby dick those thing had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunter to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come nor did wild rumor of all sort fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true history of these deadly encounter for not only do fabulous rumor naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible event a the smitten tree give birth to it fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumor abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and a the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumor which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen a a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailor but of all sailor they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye it greatest marvel but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest water that though you sailed a thousand mile and passed a thousand shore you would not come to any chiseled hearth stone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitude and longitude pursuing too such a calling a he doe the whaleman is wrapped by influence all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery space the outblown rumor of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hint and half formed f tal suggestion of supernatural agency which eventually invested moby dick with new terror unborrowed from anything that visibly appears so that in many case such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumor at least had heard of the white whale few of those hunter were willing to encounter the peril of his jaw but there were still other and more vital practical influence at work not even at the present day ha the original prestige of the sperm whale a fearfully distinguished from all other specie of the leviathan died out of the mind of the whalemen a a body there are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would perhaps either from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nation not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatch these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tale of southern whaling nor is the pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prow which stem him and a if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary time thrown it shadow before it we find some book naturalist olassen and povelson declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious a continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time a cuvier s were these or almost similar impression effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish shark included are struck with the most lively terror and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rock with such violence a to cause instantaneous death and however the general experience in the fishery may amend such report a these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitude of their vocation revived in the mind of the hunter so that overawed by the rumor and portent concerning him not a few of the fisherman recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier day of the sperm whale fishery when it wa oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the peril of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathan might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition a the sperm whale wa not for mortal man that to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are some remarkable document that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these thing were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specific detail of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniment were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered one of the wild suggestion referred to a at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the mind of the superstitiously inclined wa the unearthly conceit that moby dick wa ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitude at one and the same instant of time nor credulous a such mind must have been wa this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for a the secret of the current in the sea have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden way of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuer and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculation regarding them especially concerning the mystic mode whereby after sounding to a great depth he transport himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant point it is a thing well known to both american and english whale ship and a well a thing placed upon authoritative record year ago by scoresby that some whale have been captured far north in the pacific in whose body have been found the barb of harpoon darted in the greenland sea nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instance it ha been declared that the interval of time between the two assault could not have exceeded very many day hence by inference it ha been believed by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a problem to man wa never a problem to the whale so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigy related in old time of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there wa said to be a lake in which the wreck of ship floated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose water were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narration are almost fully equalled by the reality of the whalemen forced into familiarity then with such prodigy a these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assault the white whale had escaped alive it can not be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstition declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though grove of spear should be planted in his flank he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billow hundred of league away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there wa enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power for it wa not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whale but a wa elsewhere thrown out a peculiar snow white wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent feature the token whereby even in the limitless uncharted sea he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him the rest of his body wa so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleaming nor wa it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror a that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific account he had over and over again evinced in his assault more than all his treacherous retreat struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuer with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several time been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boat to splinter or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several fatality had attended his chase but though similar disaster however little bruited ashore were by no mean unusual in the fishery yet in most instance such seemed the white whale s infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused wa not wholly regarded a having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitch of inflamed distracted fury the mind of his more desperate hunter were impelled when amid the chip of chewed boat and the sinking limb of torn comrade they swam out of the white curd of the whale s direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on a if at a birth or a bridal his three boat stove around him and oar and men both whirling in the eddy one captain seizing the line knife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale a an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep life of the whale that captain wa ahab and then it wa that suddenly sweeping his sickle shaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahab s leg a a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice small reason wa there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woe but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperation the white whale swam before him a the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agency which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which ha been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christian ascribe one half of the world which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring it idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torment all that stir up the lee of thing all truth with malice in it all that crack the sinew and cake the brain all the subtle demonism of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon the whale s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then a if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot heart s shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania in him took it instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long month of day and week ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape then it wa that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad that it wa only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact that at interval during the passage he wa a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and wa moreover intensified by his delirium that his mate were forced to lace him fast even there a he sailed raving in his hammock in a strait jacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gale and when running into more sufferable latitude the ship with mild stun sail spread floated across the tranquil tropic and to all appearance the old man s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swell and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected front however pale and issued his calm order once again and his mate thanked god the direful madness wa now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form ahab s full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flow narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but a in his narrow flowing monomania not one jot of ahab s broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all it concentred cannon upon it own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object this is much yet ahab s larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundity and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand however grand and wonderful now quit it and take your way ye nobler sadder soul to those vast roman hall of thermes where far beneath the fantastic tower of man s upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquity and throned on torsoes so with a broken throne the great god mock that captive king so like a caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablature of age wind ye down there ye prouder sadder soul question that proud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalty and from your grim sire only will the old state secret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my mean are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling wa only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea wa likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptom the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reason he wa all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness a the bloody hunt of whale gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fang of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brute or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underling to the attack but be all this a it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all engrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintance on shore but half dreamed of what wa lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous soul have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruise the profit to be counted down in dollar from the mint he wa intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then wa this grey headed ungodly old man chasing with curse a job s whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegade and castaway and cannibal morally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge how it wa that they so aboundingly responded to the old man s ire by what evil magic their soul were possessed that at time his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale a much their insufferable foe a his how all this came to be what the white whale wa to them or how to their unconscious understanding also in some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the sea of life all this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner that work in u all how can one tell whither lead his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his pick who doe not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow of a seventy four can stand still for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill chapter the whiteness of the whale what the white whale wa to ahab ha been hinted what at time he wa to me a yet remains unsaid aside from those more obvious consideration touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any man s soul some alarm there wa another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him which at time by it intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable wa it that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form it wa the whiteness of the whale that above all thing appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chapter might be naught though in many natural object whiteness refiningly enhances beauty a if imparting some special virtue of it own a in marble japonica and pearl and though various nation have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old king of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephant above all their other magniloquent ascription of dominion and the modern king of siam unfurling the same snow white quadruped in the royal standard and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow white charger and the great austrian empire c sarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this pre eminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness ha been even made significant of gladness for among the roman a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathy and symbolizing this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble thing the innocence of bride the benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum wa the deepest pledge of honor though in many clime whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of king and queen drawn by milk white steed though even in the higher mystery of the most august religion it ha been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian fire worshipper the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythology great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow white bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog wa by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian priest derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomp of the romish faith white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the vision of st john white robe are given to the redeemed and the four and twenty elder stand clothed in white before the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated association with whatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strike more of panic to the soul than that redness which affright in blood this elusive quality it is which cause the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly association and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bound witness the white bear of the pole and the white shark of the tropic what but their smooth flaky whiteness make them the transcendent horror they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fierce fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage a the white shrouded bear or shark with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rise from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stand invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotion in our mind the polar bear frightens u with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror a for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary mood strangely tally with the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish mass for the dead begin with requiem eternam eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habit the french call him requin bethink thee of the albatross whence come those cloud of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sail in all imagination not coleridge first threw that spell but god s great unflattering laureate nature i remember the first albatross i ever saw it wa during a prolonged gale in water hard upon the antarctic sea from my forenoon watch below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatch i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at interval it arched forth it vast archangel wing a if to embrace some holy ark wondrous fluttering and throbbing shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cry a some king s ghost in supernatural distress through it inexpressible strange eye methought i peeped to secret which took hold of god a abraham before the angel i bowed myself the white thing wa so white it wing so wide and in those for ever exiled water i had lost the miserable warping memory of tradition and of town long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i can not tell can only hint the thing that darted through me then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird wa this a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i learned that goney wa some seaman s name for albatross so that by no possibility could coleridge s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impression which were mine when i saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of term there are bird called grey albatross and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotion a when i beheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line a the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round it neck with the ship s time and place and then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man wa taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing folding the invoking and adoring cherub most famous in our western annals and indian tradition is that of the white steed of the prairie a magnificent milk white charger large eyed small headed bluff chested and with the dignity of a thousand monarch in his lofty overscorning carriage he wa the elected xerxes of vast herd of wild horse whose pasture in those day were only fenced by the rocky mountain and the alleghanies at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening lead on the host of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housing more resplendent than gold and silver beater could have furnished him a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eye of the old trapper and hunter revived the glory of those primeval time when adam walked majestic a a god bluff browed and fearless a this mighty steed whether marching amid his aide and marshal in the van of countless cohort that endlessly streamed it over the plain like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subject browsing all around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostril reddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest indian he wa the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stand on legendary record of this noble horse that it wa his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other instance where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shock the eye a that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bear the albino is a well made a other men ha no substantive deformity and yet this mere aspect of all pervading whiteness make him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so nor in quite other aspect doe nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agency fail to enlist among her force this crowning attribute of the terrible from it snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern sea ha been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instance ha the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate white hood of ghent murder their bailiff in the market place nor in some thing doe the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it can not well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there a if indeed that pallor were a much like the badge of consternation in the other world a of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstition do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantom all ghost rising in a milk white fog yea while these terror seize u let u add that even the king of terror when personified by the evangelist ride on his pallid horse therefore in his other mood symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in it profoundest idealized significance it call up a peculiar apparition to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the citation of some of those instance wherein this thing of whiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct association calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over u the same sorcery however modified can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct u to the hidden cause we seek let u try but in a matter like this subtlety appeal to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these hall and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impression about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day doe the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless procession of slow pacing pilgrim down cast and hooded with new fallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the middle american state why doe the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what is there apart from the tradition of dungeoned warrior and king which will not wholly account for it that make the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structure it neighbor the byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer tower the white mountain of new hampshire whence in peculiar mood come that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of virginia s blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitude and longitude doe the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lull u with mortal thought of long lacquered mild afternoon on the wave followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunset or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tale of central europe doe the tall pale man of the hartz forest whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glide through the green of the grove why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imp of the blocksburg nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedral toppling earthquake nor the stampedoes of her frantic sea nor the tearlessness of arid sky that never rain nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spire wrenched cope stone and cross all adroop like canted yard of anchored fleet and her suburban avenue of house wall lying over upon each other a a tossed pack of card it is not these thing alone which make tearless lima the strangest saddest city thou can st see for lima ha taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old a pizarro this whiteness keep her ruin for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spread over her broken rampart the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fix it own distortion i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of object otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearance whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statement may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following example first the mariner when drawing nigh the coast of foreign land if by night he hear the roar of breaker start to vigilance and feel just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculty but under precisely similar circumstance let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness a if from encircling headland shoal of combed white bear were swimming round him then he feel a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened water is horrible to him a a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still off sounding heart and helm they both go down he never rest till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it wa not so much the fear of striking hidden rock a the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the snow howdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitude and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitude much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference view an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the antarctic sea where at time by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the power of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbow speaking hope and solace to his misery view what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with it lean ice monument and splintered cross but thou sayest methinks that white lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont far removed from all beast of prey why is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he can not even see it but only smell it wild animal muskiness why will he start snort and with bursting eye paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any goring of wild creature in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smell can not recall to him anything associated with the experience of former peril for what know he this new england colt of the black bison of distant oregon no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousand of mile from oregon still when he smell that savage musk the rending goring bison herd are a present a to the deserted wild foal of the prairie which this instant they may be trampling into dust thus then the muffled rolling of a milky sea the bleak rustling of the festooned frost of mountain the desolate shifting of the windrowed snow of prairie all these to ishmael are a the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt though neither know where lie the nameless thing of which the mystic sign give forth such hint yet with me a with the colt somewhere those thing must exist though in many of it aspect this visible world seems formed in love the invisible sphere were formed in fright but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeal with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentous why a we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual thing nay the very veil of the christian s deity and yet should be a it is the intensifying agent in thing the most appalling to mankind is it that by it indefiniteness it shadow forth the heartless void and immensity of the universe and thus stab u from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depth of the milky way or is it that a in essence whiteness is not so much a colour a the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colour is it for these reason that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snow a colourless all colour of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosopher that all other earthly hue every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinge of sunset sky and wood yea and the gilded velvet of butterfly and the butterfly cheek of young girl all these are but subtile deceit not actually inherent in substance but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely paint like the harlot whose allurement cover nothing but the charnel house within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produce every one of her hue the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all object even tulip and rose with it own blank tinge pondering all this the palsied universe lie before u a leper and like wilful traveller in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glass upon their eye so the wretched infidel gaze himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wrap all the prospect around him and of all these thing the albino whale wa the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery hunt chapter hark hist did you hear that noise cabaco it wa the middle watch a fair moonlight the seaman were standing in a cordon extending from one of the fresh water butt in the waist to the scuttle butt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the bucket to fill the scuttle butt standing for the most part on the hallowed precinct of the quarter deck they were careful not to speak or rustle their foot from hand to hand the bucket went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel it wa in the midst of this repose that archy one of the cordon whose post wa near the after hatch whispered to his neighbor a cholo the word above hist did you hear that noise cabaco take the bucket will ye archy what noise d ye mean there it is again under the hatch don t you hear it a cough it sounded like a cough cough be damned pas along that return bucket there again there it is it sound like two or three sleeper turning over now caramba have done shipmate will ye it s the three soaked biscuit ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye nothing else look to the bucket say what ye will shipmate i ve sharp ear aye you are the chap ain t ye that heard the hum of the old quakeress s knitting needle fifty mile at sea from nantucket you re the chap grin away we ll see what turn up hark ye cabaco there is somebody down in the after hold that ha not yet been seen on deck and i suspect our old mogul know something of it too i heard stubb tell flask one morning watch that there wa something of that sort in the wind tish the bucket chapter the chart had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea chart spread them before him on his screwed down table then seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various line and shading which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional course over space that before were blank at interval he would refer to pile of old log book beside him wherein were set down the season and place in which on various former voyage of various ship sperm whale had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chain over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleam and shadow of line upon his wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himself wa marking out line and course on the wrinkled chart some invisible pencil wa also tracing line and course upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead but it wa not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin ahab thus pondered over his chart almost every night they were brought out almost every night some pencil mark were effaced and others were substituted for with the chart of all four ocean before him ahab wa threading a maze of current and eddy with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the way of the leviathan it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped ocean of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew the set of all tide and current and thereby calculating the drifting of the sperm whale s food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained season for hunting him in particular latitude could arrive at reasonable surmise almost approaching to certainty concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale s resorting to given water that many hunter believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the log for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migration of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring shoal or the flight of swallow on this hint attempt have been made to construct elaborate migratory chart of the sperm whale since the above wa written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april th by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and portion of it are presented in the circular this chart divide the ocean into district of five degree of latitude by five degree of longitude perpendicularly through each of which district are twelve column for the twelve month and horizontally through each of which district are three line one to show the number of day that have been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the number of day in which whale sperm or right have been seen besides when making a passage from one feeding ground to another the sperm whale guided by some infallible instinct say rather secret intelligence from the deity mostly swim in vein a they are called continuing their way along a given ocean line with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these case the direction taken by any one whale be straight a a surveyor s parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confined to it own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these time he is said to swim generally embrace some few mile in width more or less a the vein is presumed to expand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale ship s mast head when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at particular season within that breadth and along that path migrating whale may with great confidence be looked for and hence not only at substantiated time upon well known separate feeding ground could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanse of water between those ground he could by his art so place and time himself on his way a even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting there wa a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality perhaps though the gregarious sperm whale have their regular season for particular ground yet in general you can not conclude that the herd which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instance where the contrary of this ha proved true in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitary and hermit among the matured aged sperm whale so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those spot at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feeding ground where he had at time revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual stopping place and ocean inn so to speak not his place of prolonged abode and where ahab s chance of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion ha only been made to whatever way side antecedent extra prospect were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibility would become probability and a ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase the season on the line for there and then for several consecutive year moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those water for awhile a the sun in it annual round loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac there it wa too that most of the deadly encounter with the white whale had taken place there the wave were storied with his deed there also wa that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hope upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those hope nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart a to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the season on the line no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southward double cape horn and then running down sixty degree of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequod s sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexion of thing because an interval of three hundred and sixty five day and night wa before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in sea far remote from his periodical feeding ground should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china sea or in any other water haunted by his race so that monsoon pampas nor wester harmattan trade any wind but the levanter and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zig zag world circle of the pequod s circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even a a white bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfare of constantinople yes for the peculiar snow white brow of moby dick and his snow white hump could not but be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself a after poring over his chart till long after midnight he would throw himself back in revery tallied him and shall he escape his broad fin are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheep s ear and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trance of torment doe that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleep with clenched hand and wake with his own bloody nail in his palm often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dream of the night which resuming his own intense thought through the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his life spot became insufferable anguish and when a wa sometimes the case these spiritual throe in him heaved his being up from it base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flame and lightning shot up and accursed fiend beckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eye ahab would burst from his state room a though escaping from a bed that wa on fire yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptom of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest token of it intensity for at such time crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock wa not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again the latter wa the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other time employed it for it outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it wa no longer an integral but a the mind doe not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahab s case yielding up all his thought and fancy to his one supreme purpose that purpose by it own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against god and devil into a kind of self assumed independent being of it own nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it wa conjoined fled horror stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eye when what seemed ahab rushed from his room wa for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thought have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus make him a prometheus a vulture feed upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates chapter the affidavit so far a what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed a indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particular in the habit of sperm whale the foregoing chapter in it earlier part is a important a one a will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some mind a to the natural verity of the main point of this affair i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citation of item practically or reliably known to me a a whaleman and from these citation i take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known three instance where a whale after receiving a harpoon ha effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three year ha been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two iron both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where three year intervened between the flinging of the two harpoon and i think it may have been something more than that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two year often endangered by serpent savage tiger poisonous miasma with all the other common peril incident to wandering in the heart of unknown region meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on it travel no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with it flank all the coast of africa but to no purpose this man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have known three instance similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whale struck and upon the second attack saw the two iron with the respective mark cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the three year instance it so fell out that i wa in the boat both time first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale s eye which i had observed there three year previous i say three year but i am pretty sure it wa more than that here are three instance then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many other instance from person whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instance where a particular whale in the ocean ha been at distant time and place popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked wa not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarity a distinguished from other whale for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarity by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil no the reason wa this that from the fatal experience of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale a there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most fisherman were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulin when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devil ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutation to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not only did each of these famous whale enjoy great individual celebrity nay you may call it an ocean wide renown not only wa he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle story after death but he wa admitted into all the right privilege and distinction of a name had a much a name indeed a cambyses or c sar wa it not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long did st lurk in the oriental strait of that name whose spout wa oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay wa it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of all cruiser that crossed their wake in the vicinity of the tattoo land wa it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at time assumed the semblance of a snow white cross against the sky wa it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphic upon the back in plain prose here are four whale a well known to the student of cetacean history a marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various time creating great havoc among the boat of different vessel were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captain who heaved up their anchor with that express object a much in view a in setting out through the narragansett wood captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other thing which to me seem important a in printed form establishing in all respect the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of those disheartening instance where truth requires full a much bolstering a error so ignorant are most landsman of some of the plainest and most palpable wonder of the world that without some hint touching the plain fact historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at moby dick a a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory first though most men have some vague flitting idea of the general peril of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception of those peril and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disaster and death by casualty in the fishery ever find a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whale line off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do you suppose that that poor fellow s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to morrow at your breakfast no because the mail are very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ship every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boat s crew for god s sake be economical with your lamp and candle not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of man s blood wa spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two fold enormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plague of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in some case sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious a with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale ha done it first in the year the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket wa cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spout lowered her boat and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whale ere long several of the whale were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boat issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than ten minute she settled down and fell over not a surviving plank of her ha been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land in their boat being returned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the god shipwrecked him again upon unknown rock and breaker for the second time his ship wa utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he ha never tempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who wa chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few mile of the scene of the catastrophe the following are extract from chace s narrative every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it wa anything but chance which directed his operation he made two several attack upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which according to their direction were calculated to do u the most injury by being made ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two object for the shock to effect which the exact man uvres which he made were necessary his aspect wa most horrible and such a indicated resentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companion a if fired with revenge for their suffering again at all event the whole circumstance taken together all happening before my own eye and producing at the time impression in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impression i can not now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion here are his reflection some time after quitting the ship during a black night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling water were nothing the fear of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rock with all the other ordinary subject of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflection until day again made it appearance in another place p he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal secondly the ship union also of nantucket wa in the year totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic particular of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunter i have now and then heard casual allusion to it thirdly some eighteen or twenty year ago commodore j then commanding an american sloop of war of the first class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captain on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich island conversation turning upon whale the commodore wa pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentleman present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloop of war a to cause her to leak so much a a thimbleful very good but there is more coming some week after the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he wa stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moment confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the commodore s craft such a thwack that with all his pump going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the commodore s interview with that whale a providential wa not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now refer you to langsdorff s voyage for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you must know by the way wa attached to the russian admiral krusenstern s famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begin his seventeenth chapter by the thirteenth of may our ship wa ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather wa very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing for some day we had very little wind it wa not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale the body of which wa larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but wa not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which wa in full sail wa almost upon him so that it wa impossible to prevent it striking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger a this gigantic creature setting up it back raised the ship three foot at least out of the water the mast reeled and the sail fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain d wolf applied immediately to the pump to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured now the captain d wolf here alluded to a commanding the ship in question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventure a a sea captain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however wa by no mean a large one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down manly book of old fashioned adventure so full too of honest wonder the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier s old chum i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff that i can not forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed lionel it seems wa on his way to john ferdinando a he call the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he say about four o clock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty league from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed the shock wa so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement wa a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the suddenness of the shock made the gun leap in their carriage and several of the men were shaken out of their hammock captain davis who lay with his head on a gun wa thrown out of his cabin lionel then go on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock wa after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed with several more example one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at time of the sperm whale in more than one instance he ha been known not only to chase the assailing boat back to their ship but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lance hurled at him from it deck the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and a for his strength let me say that there have been example where the line attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water a a horse walk off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then act not so often with blind rage a with wilful deliberate design of destruction to his pursuer nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minute but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain fact of the present day but that these marvel like all marvel are mere repetition of the age so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon verily there is nothing new under the sun in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the day when justinian wa emperor and belisarius general a many know he wrote the history of his own time a work every way of uncommon value by the best authority he ha always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particular not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned now in this history of his procopius mention that during the term of his prefecture at constantinople a great sea monster wa captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed vessel at interval in those water for a period of more than fifty year a fact thus set down in substantial history can not easily be gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise specie this sea monster wa is not mentioned but a he destroyed ship a well a for other reason he must have been a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep water connecting with it even now i am certain that those sea are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of thing a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigation have recently proved to me that in modern time there have been isolated instance of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale now a a vessel of war readily pass through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pas out of the mediterranean into the propontis in the propontis a far a i can learn none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale squid or cuttle fish lurks at the bottom of that sea because large creature but by no mean the largest of that sort have been found at it surface if then you properly put these statement together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning procopius s sea monster that for half a century stove the ship of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale chapter surmise though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his thought and action ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interest to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he wa by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s way altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motif much more influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whale and that the more monster he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chance that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were still additional consideration which though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no mean incapable of swaying him to accomplish his object ahab must use tool and of all tool used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respect wa over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation starbuck s body and starbuck s coerced will were ahab s so long a ahab kept his magnet at starbuck s brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captain s quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale wa seen during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapse of rebellion against his captain s leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influence were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick wa noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few men s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watch his officer and men must have some nearer thing to think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailor of all sort are more or less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outer weather and they inhale it fickleness and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all thing requisite that temporary interest and employment should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash nor wa ahab unmindful of another thing in time of strong emotion mankind disdain all base consideration but such time are evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the heart of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breed a certain generous knight errantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetite for even the high lifted and chivalric crusader of old time were not content to traverse two thousand mile of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglary picking pocket and gaining other pious perquisite by the way had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object that final and romantic object too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all hope of cash aye cash they may scorn cash now but let some month go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor wa there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod s voyage ahab wa now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequence of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it wa possible for his crew to be subjected to for all these reason then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod s voyage observe all customary usage and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession be all this a it may his voice wa now often heard hailing the three mast head and admonishing them to keep a bright look out and not omit reporting even a porpoise this vigilance wa not long without reward chapter the mat maker it wa a cloudy sultry afternoon the seaman were lazily lounging about the deck or vacantly gazing over into the lead coloured water queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword mat for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding wa all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self i wa the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat a i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarn of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and a queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the thread and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed a if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fate there lay the fixed thread of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other thread with it own this warp seemed necessity and here thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable thread meantime queequeg s impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly a the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savage s sword thought i which thus finally shape and fashion both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance aye chance free will and necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly working together the straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from it ultimate course it every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given thread and chance though restrained in it play within the right line of necessity and sideways in it motion directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turn rule either and ha the last featuring blow at event thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the cloud whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the cross tree wa that mad gay header tashtego his body wa reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden interval he continued his cry to be sure the same sound wa that very moment perhaps being heard all over the sea from hundred of whalemen s look out perched a high in the air but from few of those lung could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence a from tashtego the indian s a he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadow of fate and by those wild cry announcing their coming there she blow there there there she blow she blow where away on the lee beam about two mile off a school of them instantly all wa commotion the sperm whale blow a a clock tick with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribe of his genus there go fluke wa now the cry from tashtego and the whale disappeared quick steward cried ahab time time dough boy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to ahab the ship wa now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whale had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bow for that singular craft at time evinced by the sperm whale when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mill round and swiftly swim off in the opposite quarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action for there wa no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of the men selected for shipkeepers that is those not appointed to the boat by this time relieved the indian at the main mast head the sailor at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tub were fixed in their place the crane were thrust out the mainyard wa backed and the three boat swung over the sea like three samphire basket over high cliff outside of the bulwark their eager crew with one hand clung to the rail while one foot wa expectantly poised on the gunwale so look the long line of man of war s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy s ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation wa heard that took every eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who wa surrounded by five dusky phantom that seemed fresh formed out of air chapter the first lowering the phantom for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackle and band of the boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boat though technically called the captain s on account of it hanging from the starboard quarter the figure that now stood by it bow wa tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from it steel like lip a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness wa a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companion of this figure were of that vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal native of the manilla a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariner supposed to be the paid spy and secret confidential agent on the water of the devil their lord whose counting room they suppose to be elsewhere while yet the wondering ship s company were gazing upon these stranger ahab cried out to the white turbaned old man at their head all ready there fedallah ready wa the half hissed reply lower away then d ye hear shouting across the deck lower away there i say such wa the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaf whirled round in the block with a wallow the three boat dropped into the sea while with a dexterous off handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailor goat like leaped down the rolling ship s side into the tossed boat below hardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five stranger rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so a to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eye again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmate of the other boat obeyed not the command captain ahab said starbuck spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boat thou flask pull out more to leeward aye aye sir cheerily cried little king post sweeping round his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew there there there again there she blow right ahead boy lay back never heed yonder yellow boy archy oh i don t mind em sir said archy i knew it all before now didn t i hear em in the hold and didn t i tell cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaway mr flask pull pull my fine heart alive pull my child pull my little one drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom still showed sign of uneasiness why don t you break your backbone my boy what is it you stare at those chap in yonder boat tut they are only five more hand come to help u never mind from where the more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstone devil are good fellow enough so so there you are now that s the stroke for a thousand pound that s the stroke to sweep the stake hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my hero three cheer men all heart alive easy easy don t be in a hurry don t be in a hurry why don t you snap your oar you rascal bite something you dog so so so then softly softly that s it that s it long and strong give way there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallion ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleeper and pull pull will ye pull can t ye pull won t ye why in the name of gudgeon and ginger cake don t ye pull pull and break something pull and start your eye out here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mother s son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth that s it that s it now ye do something that look like it my steel bit start her start her my silver spoon start her marling spike stubb s exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passion with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would say the most terrific thing to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely a a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocation without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly gaped open mouthed at time that the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew then again stubb wa one of those odd sort of humorist whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous a to put all inferior on their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck wa now pulling obliquely across stubb s bow and when for a minute or so the two boat were pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inch a he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from stubb s what think ye of those yellow boy sir smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong boy in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lad but never mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what will spring my men spring there s hogshead of sperm ahead mr stubb and that s what ye came for pull my boy sperm sperm s the play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand aye aye i thought a much soliloquized stubb when the boat diverged a soon a i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and that s what he went into the after hold for so often a dough boy long suspected they were hidden down there the white whale s at the bottom of it well well so be it can t be helped all right give way men it ain t the white whale to day give way now the advent of these outlandish stranger at such a critical instant a the lowering of the boat from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship s company but archy s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and stubb s confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjecture a to dark ahab s precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious shadow i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn a well a the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah meantime ahab out of hearing of his officer having sided the furthest to windward wa still ranging ahead of the other boat a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew wa pulling him those tiger yellow creature of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five trip hammer they rose and fell with regular stroke of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer a for fedallah who wa seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depression of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencer s thrown half backward into the air a if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab wa seen steadily managing his steering oar a in a thousand boat lowering ere the white whale had torn him all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boat s five oar were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boat in the rear paused on their way the whale had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it every man look out along his oar cried starbuck thou queequeg stand up nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eye gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it wa also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself wa seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea not very far distant flask s boat wa also lying breathlessly still it commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two foot above the level of the stern platform it is used for catching turn with the whale line it top is not more spacious than the palm of a man s hand and standing upon such a base a that flask seemed perched at the mast head of some ship which had sunk to all but her truck but little king post wa small and short and at the same time little king post wa full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand point of his did by no mean satisfy king post i can t see three sea off tip u up an oar there and let me on to that upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulder for a pedestal good a mast head a any sir will you mount that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you fifty foot taller whereupon planting his foot firmly against two opposite plank of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to flask s foot and then putting flask s hand on his hearse plumed head and bidding him spring a he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulder and here wa flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross running sea still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstance but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo wa yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen haired flask seemed a snow flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro s lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tide and her season for that meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far gazing solicitude the whale might have made one of their regular sounding not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case stubb a his wont in such case it seems wa resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumb end but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eye had been setting to windward like two fixed star suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat cry out in a quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give way there they are to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puff of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billow the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled a it were like the air over intensely heated plate of iron beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whale were swimming seen in advance of all the other indication the puff of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning courier and detached flying outrider all four boat were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on a a mass of interblending bubble borne down a rapid stream from the hill pull pull my good boy said starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eye darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed a two visible needle in two unerring binnacle compass he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the silence of the boat wa at interval startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whisper now harsh with command now soft with entreaty how different the loud little king post sing out and say something my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolt beach me beach me on their black back boy only do that for me and i ll sign over to you my martha s vineyard plantation boy including wife and child boy lay me on lay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed after he s got fit that flask ha fit yes give him fit that s the very word pitch fit into em merrily merrily heart alive pudding for supper you know merry s the word pull babe pull suckling pull all but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbone and bite your knife in two that s all take it easy why don t ye take it easy i say and burst all your liver and lung but what it wa that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger yellow crew of his these were word best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel shark in the audacious sea may give ear to such word when with tornado brow and eye of red murder and foam glued lip ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile all the boat tore on the repeated specific allusion of flask to that whale a he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat s bow with it tail these allusion of his were at time so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this wa against all rule for the oarsman must put out their eye and ram a skewer through their neck usage pronouncing that they must have no organ but ear and no limb but arm in these critical moment it wa a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swell of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made a they rolled along the eight gunwale like gigantic bowl in a boundless bowling green the brief suspended agony of the boat a it would tip for an instant on the knife like edge of the sharper wave that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glen and hollow the keen spurring and goading to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sled like slide down it other side all these with the cry of the headsman and harpooneer and the shuddering gasp of the oarsman with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boat with outstretched sail like a wild hen after her screaming brood all this wa thrilling not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead man s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotion than that man doe who for the first time find himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase wa now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadow flung upon the sea the jet of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whale seemed separating their wake the boat were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whale running dead to leeward our sail wa now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oar could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row lock soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be seen give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall come there s white water again close to spring soon after two cry in quick succession on each side of u denoted that the other boat had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightning like hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his foot though not one of the oarsman wa then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eye on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound a of fifty elephant stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat wa still booming through the mist the wave curling and hissing around u like the erected crest of enraged serpent that s his hump there there give it to him whispered starbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it wa the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath u the whole crew were half suffocated a they were tossed helter skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped though completely swamped the boat wa nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the floating oar and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our place there we sat up to our knee in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eye the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to u from the bottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl the wave dashed their buckler together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around u like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaw of death in vain we hailed the other boat a well roar to the live coal down the chimney of a flaming furnace a hail those boat in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadow of night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempt to bale out the boat the oar were useless a propeller performing now the office of life preserver so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failure starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg a the standard bearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eye a the dawn came on the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his foot hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking a of rope and yard hitherto muffled by the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mist were dimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea a the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon u within a distance of not much more than it length floating on the wave we saw the abandoned boat a for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship s bow like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it wa seen no more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the sea and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall came close to the other boat had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given u up but wa still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing an oar or a lance pole chapter the hyena there are certain queer time and occasion in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man take this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspect that the joke is at nobody s expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolt down all event all creed and belief and persuasion all hard thing visible and invisible never mind how knobby a an ostrich of potent digestion gobble down bullet and gun flint and a for small difficulty and worrying prospect of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly good natured hit and jolly punch in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of come over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it come in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like the peril of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale it object queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and i wa still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water queequeg my fine friend doe this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such thing did often happen mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oil jacket wa now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman s discretion certain i ve lowered for whale from a leaking ship in a gale off cape horn mr flask said i turning to little king post who wa standing close by you are experienced in these thing and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back foremost into death s jaw can t you twist that smaller said flask yes that s the law i should like to see a boat s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that here then from three impartial witness i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squall and capsizing in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matter of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hand of him who steered the boat oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat wa chiefly to be imputed to starbuck s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding wa famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbuck s boat and finally considering in what a devil s chase i wa implicated touching the white whale taking all thing together i say i thought i might a well go below and make a rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee it may seem strange that of all men sailor should be tinkering at their last will and testament but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion this wa the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing after the ceremony wa concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone wa rolled away from my heart besides all the day i should now live would be a good a the day that lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many month or week a the case might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bar of a snug family vault now then thought i unconsciously rolling up the sleeve of my frock here go for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost chapter ahab s boat and crew fedallah who would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug hole with my timber toe oh he s a wonderful old man i don t think it so strange after all on that account said flask if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing that would disable him but he ha one knee and good part of the other left you know i don t know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel among whale wise people it ha often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active peril of the chase so tamerlane s soldier often argued with tear in their eye whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering that with two leg man is but a hobbling wight in all time of danger considering that the pursuit of whale is always under great and extraordinary difficulty that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstance is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale boat in the hunt a a general thing the joint owner of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although his friend at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitude of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his order in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him a a regular headsman in the hunt above all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men a that same boat s crew he well knew that such generous conceit never entered the head of the owner of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boat s crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desire on that head nevertheless he had taken private measure of his own touching all that matter until cabaco s published discovery the sailor had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hand had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboat for service when some time after this ahab wa now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole pin with his own hand for what wa thought to be one of the spare boat and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewer which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this wa observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat a if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat a it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boat s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it wa observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these thing i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no mean involve the remotest suspicion a to any boat s crew being assigned to that boat now with the subordinate phantom what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonder soon wane besides now and then such unaccountable odds and end of strange nation come up from the unknown nook and ash hole of the earth to man these floating outlaw of whaler and the ship themselves often pick up such queer castaway creature found tossing about the open sea on plank bit of wreck oar whaleboat canoe blown off japanese junk and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle but be all this a it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantom soon found their place among the crew though still a it were somehow distinct from them yet that hair turbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahab s peculiar fortune nay so far a to have some sort of a half hinted influence heaven know but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew but one can not sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah he wa such a creature a civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dream and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic community especially the oriental isle to the east of the continent those insulated immemorial unalterable country which even in these modern day still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth s primal generation when the memory of the first man wa a distinct recollection and all men his descendant unknowing whence he came eyed each other a real phantom and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to genesis the angel indeed consorted with the daughter of men the devil also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amour chapter the spirit spout day week passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising ground that off the azores off the cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it wa while gliding through these latter water that one serene and moonlight night when all the wave rolled by like scroll of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet wa seen far in advance of the white bubble at the bow lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight night it wa his wont to mount to the main mast head and stand a look out there with the same precision a if it had been day and yet though herd of whale were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotion then the seaman beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hour his turban and the moon companion in one sky but when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive night without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice wa heard announcing that silvery moon lit jet every reclining mariner started to his foot a if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blow had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it wa a most unwonted hour yet so impressive wa the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering walking the deck with quick side lunging stride ahab commanded the t gallant sail and royal to be set and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then with every mast head manned the piled up craft rolled down before the wind the strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollow of so many sail made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the foot while still she rushed along a if two antagonistic influence were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched ahab s face that night you would have thought that in him also two different thing were warring while his one live leg made lively echo along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin tap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrow the eager glance shot yet the silvery jet wa no more seen that night every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time this midnight spout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some day after lo at the same silent hour it wa again announced again it wa descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared a if it had never been and so it served u night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight a the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two day or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring u on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness a it seemed which in many thing invested the pequod were there wanting some of the seaman who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote time or in however far apart latitude and longitude that unnearable spout wa cast by one self same whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition a if it were treacherously beckoning u on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon u and rend u at last in the remotest and most savage sea these temporary apprehension so vague but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all it blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm a for day and day we voyaged along through sea so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urn like prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape wind began howling around u and we rose and fell upon the long troubled sea that are there when the ivory tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark wave in her madness till like shower of silver chip the foam flake flew over her bulwark then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sight more dismal than before close to our bow strange form in the water darted hither and thither before u while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea raven and every morning perched on our stay row of these bird were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp a though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roosting place for their homeless self and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea a if it vast tide were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoso a called of yore for long allured by the perfidious silence that before had attended u we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where guilty being transformed into those fowl and these fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon but calm snow white and unvarying still directing it fountain of feather to the sky still beckoning u on from before the solitary jet would at time be descried during all this blackness of the element ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mate in tempestuous time like these after everything above and aloft ha been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalist so with his ivory leg inserted into it accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hour and hour would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelash together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous sea that burstingly broke over it bow stood in a line along the bulwark in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping wave each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung a in a loosened belt few or no word were spoken and the silent ship a if manned by painted sailor in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac wave by night the same muteness of humanity before the shriek of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowline still wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old man s aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eye sitting straight in his floor screwed chair the rain and half melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those chart of tide and current which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the body wa erect the head wa thrown back so that the closed eye were pointed towards the needle of the tell tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling the cabin compass is called the tell tale because without going to the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course of the ship terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter the albatross south eastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross by name a she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the fore mast head i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fishery a whaler at sea and long absent from home a if the wave had been fuller this craft wa bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her side this spectral appearance wa traced with long channel of reddened rust while all her spar and her rigging were like the thick branch of tree furred over with hoar frost only her lower sail were set a wild sight it wa to see her long bearded look out at those three mast head they seemed clad in the skin of beast so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four year of cruising standing in iron hoop nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast head of one ship to those of the other yet those forlorn looking fisherman mildly eyeing u a they passed said not one word to our own look out while the quarter deck hail wa being heard from below ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale but a the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwark wa in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship wa still increasing the distance between while in various silent way the seaman of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whale s name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed a though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel wa a nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailed ahoy there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letter to the pacific ocean and this time three year if i am not at home tell them to address them to at that moment the two wake were fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular way shoal of small harmless fish that for some day before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fin and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger s flank though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifle capriciously carry meaning swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the word but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voice up helm keep her off round the world round the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feeling but whereto doe all that circumnavigation conduct only through numberless peril to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before u were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distance and discover sight more sweet and strange than any cyclades or island of king solomon then there were promise in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mystery we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swim before all human heart while chasing such over this round globe they either lead u on in barren maze or midway leave u whelmed chapter the gam the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken wa this the wind and sea betokened storm but even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded her judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasion if so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put for a it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five minute with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usage of whaling vessel when meeting each other in foreign sea and especially on a common cruising ground if two stranger crossing the pine barren in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wild these twain for the life of them can not well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barren and salisbury plain of the sea two whaling vessel descrying each other at the end of the earth off lone fanning s island or the far away king s mill how much more natural i say that under such circumstance these ship should not only interchange hail but come into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessel owned in one seaport and whose captain officer and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sort of dear domestic thing to talk about for the long absent ship the outward bounder perhaps ha letter on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some paper of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb worn file and in return for that courtesy the outward bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessel crossing each other s track on the cruising ground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a transfer of letter from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letter may be for the people of the ship she now meet besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathy of sailor but likewise with all the peculiar congeniality arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privation and peril nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long a both party speak one language a is the case with american and english though to be sure from the small number of english whaler such meeting do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he doe not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whaler sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whaler regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript provincialism a a sort of sea peasant but where this superiority in the english whalemen doe really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankee in one day collectively kill more whale than all the english collectively in ten year but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale hunter which the nantucketer doe not take much to heart probably because he know that he ha a few foible himself so then we see that of all ship separately sailing the sea the whaler have most reason to be sociable and they are so whereas some merchant ship crossing each other s wake in the mid atlantic will oftentimes pas on without so much a a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high sea like a brace of dandy in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each other s rig a for men of war when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of silly bowing and scraping such a ducking of ensign that there doe not seem to be much right down hearty good will and brotherly love about it at all a touching slave ship meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other a soon a possible and a for pirate when they chance to cross each other s cross bone the first hail is how many skull the same way that whaler hail how many barrel and that question once answered pirate straightway steer apart for they are infernal villain on both side and don t like to see overmuch of each other s villanous likeness but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable free and easy whaler what doe the whaler do when she meet another whaler in any sort of decent weather she ha a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ship that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouter and blubber boiler and such like pretty exclamation why it is that all merchant seaman and also all pirate and man of war s men and slave ship sailor cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale ship this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of pirate say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs ha any peculiar glory about it it sometimes end in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he ha no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate ha no solid basis to stand on but what is a gam you might wear out your index finger running up and down the column of dictionary and never find the word dr johnson never attained to that erudition noah webster s ark doe not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word ha now for many year been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankee certainly it need a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view let me learnedly define it gam noun a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a cruising ground when after exchanging hail they exchange visit by boat crew the two captain remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mate on the other there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here all profession have their own little peculiarity of detail so ha the whale fishery in a pirate man of war or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheet on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steer himself with a pretty little milliner s tiller decorated with gay cord and ribbon but the whale boat ha no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all high time indeed if whaling captain were wheeled about the water on castor like gouty old alderman in patent chair and a for a tiller the whale boat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore a in gamming a complete boat s crew must leave the ship and hence a the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eye of the whole visible world resting on him from the side of the two ship this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his leg nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the after oar reciprocating by rapping his knee in front he is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched leg but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of two pole and you can not stand them up then again it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted eye it would never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hand indeed a token of his entire buoyant self command he generally carry his hand in his trowsers pocket but perhaps being generally very large heavy hand he carry them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instance well authenticated one too where the captain ha been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the nearest oarsman s hair and hold on there like grim death chapter the town ho s story a told at the golden inn the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corner of a great highway where you meet more traveller than in any other part it wa not very long after speaking the goney that another homeward bound whaleman the town ho wa encountered she wa manned almost wholly by polynesian in the short gam that ensued she gave u strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white whale wa now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town ho s story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgment of god which at time are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance with it own particular accompaniment forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ear of captain ahab or his mate for that secret part of the story wa unknown to the captain of the town ho himself it wa the private property of three confederate white seaman of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunction of secrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he wa wakened he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seaman in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod s main mast interweaving in it proper place this darker thread with the story a publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record the ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin for my humor s sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friend one saint s eve smoking upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavalier the young don pedro and sebastian were on the closer term with me and hence the interluding question they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time some two year prior to my first learning the event which i am about rehearsing to you gentleman the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket wa cruising in your pacific here not very many day sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she wa somewhere to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pump according to daily usage it wa observed that she made more water in her hold than common they supposed a sword fish had stabbed her gentleman but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitude and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold a low down a wa possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariner working at the pump at wide and easy interval but no good luck came more day went by and not only wa the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the island there to have his hull hove out and repaired though no small passage wa before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pump were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those six and thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breeze the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo lakeman buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass on the eastern shore of our lake erie don but i crave your courtesy may be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentleman in square sail brig and three masted ship well nigh a large and stout a any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land locked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impression popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh water sea of ours erie and ontario and huron and superior and michigan possess an ocean like expansiveness with many of the ocean s noblest trait with many of it rimmed variety of race and of clime they contain round archipelago of romantic isle even a the polynesian water do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nation a the atlantic is they furnish long maritime approach to our numerous territorial colony from the east dotted all round their bank here and there are frowned upon by battery and by the goat like craggy gun of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victory at interval they yield their beach to wild barbarian whose red painted face flash from out their peltry wigwam for league and league are flanked by ancient and unentered forest where the gaunt pine stand like serried line of king in gothic genealogy those same wood harboring wild afric beast of prey and silken creature whose exported fur give robe to tartar emperor they mirror the paved capital of buffalo and cleveland a well a winnebago village they float alike the full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blast a direful a any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwreck are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all it shrieking crew thus gentleman though an inlander steelkilt wa wild ocean born and wild ocean nurtured a much of an audacious mariner a any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet wa he quite a vengeful and full of social quarrel a the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitude of buck horn handled bowie knife yet wa this nantucketer a man with some good hearted trait and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave s right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all event he had proved so thus far but radney wa doomed and made mad and steelkilt but gentleman you shall hear it wa not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the town ho s leak seemed again increasing but only so a to require an hour or more at the pump every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skipper think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be that he and his shipmate would never again remember it on account of all hand gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage sea far from you to the westward gentleman is it altogether unusual for ship to keep clanging at their pump handle in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those water some really landless latitude that her captain begin to feel a little anxious much this way had it been with the town ho so when her leak wa found gaining once more there wa in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sail to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose wa a little of a coward and a little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person a any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentleman therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seaman declared that it wa only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pump there wa on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them a they stood with their foot continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear a any mountain spring gentleman that bubbling from the pump ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spout at the lee scupper hole now a you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours watery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellow men find one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern s tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine a it may gentleman at all event steelkilt wa a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housing of your last viceroy s snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentleman which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagne s father but radney the mate wa ugly a a mule yet a hardy a stubborn a malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it espying the mate drawing near a he wa toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings aye aye my merry lad it s a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and let s have a taste by the lord it s worth bottling i tell ye what men old rad s investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boy that sword fish only began the job he s come back again with a gang of ship carpenter saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvement i suppose if old rad were here now i d tell him to jump overboard and scatter em they re playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but he s a simple old soul rad and a beauty too boy they say the rest of his property is invested in looking glass i wonder if he d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose damn your eye what s that pump stopping for roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailor talk thunder away at it aye aye sir said steelkilt merry a a cricket lively boy lively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engine the men tossed their hat off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lung wa heard which denotes the fullest tension of life s utmost energy quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eye bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now what cozening fiend it wa gentleman that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the plank and also a shovel and remove some offensive matter consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large now gentleman sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all time but raging gale is regularly attended to every evening it ha been known to be done in the case of ship actually foundering at the time such gentleman is the inflexibility of sea usage and the instinctive love of neatness in seaman some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their face but in all vessel this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boy if boy there be aboard besides it wa the stronger men in the town ho that had been divided into gang taking turn at the pump and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gang consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duty such being the case with his comrade i mention all these particular so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men but there wa more than this the order about the shovel wa almost a plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt a though radney had spat in his face any man who ha gone sailor in a whale ship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but a he sat still for a moment and a he steadfastly looked into the mate s malignant eye and perceived the stack of powder cask heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them a he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being a repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling gentleman stole over steelkilt therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he wa temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck wa not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lad a the customary sweeper who not being billeted at the pump had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted cooper s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by heated and irritated a he wa by his spasmodic toil at the pump for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inch of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it wa to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne a much a comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatch and thus spoke to the officer mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable malediction retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentleman the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the god immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate wa stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale ere the cry could go aft steelkilt wa shaking one of the backstay leading far aloft to where two of his comrade were standing their masthead they were both canallers canallers cried don pedro we have seen many whale ship in our harbour but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they canallers don are the boatman belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of it nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous north aye well then don refill my cup your chicha s very fine and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may throw side light upon my story for three hundred and sixty mile gentleman through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous city and most thriving village through long dismal uninhabited swamp and affluent cultivated field unrivalled for fertility by billiard room and bar room through the holy of holy of great forest on roman arch over indian river through sun and shade by happy heart or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk county and especially by row of snow white chapel whose spire stand almost like milestone flow one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life there s your true ashantee gentleman there howl your pagan where you ever find them next door to you under the long flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of church for by some curious fatality a it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooter that they ever encamp around the hall of justice so sinner gentleman most abound in holiest vicinity is that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern well for our northern friend dame isabella s inquisition wane in lima laughed don sebastian proceed senor a moment pardon cried another of the company in the name of all u limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no mean overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this coast corrupt a lima it but bear out your saying too church more plentiful than billiard table and for ever open and corrupt a lima so too venice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st mark st dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you pour out again freely depicted in his own vocation gentleman the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for day and day along his green turfed flowery nile he indolently float openly toying with his red cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sport his slouched and gaily ribboned hat betoken his grand feature a terror to the smiling innocence of the village through which he float his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in city once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turn from one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming quality of your man of violence that at time he ha a stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait a to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentleman what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains so many of it most finished graduate and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captain nor doe it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousand of our rural boy and young men born along it line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn field and recklessly ploughing the water of the most barbaric sea i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffle no need to travel the world s one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north the generation were cold and holy a the hill but the story i left off gentleman where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he wa surrounded by the three junior mate and the four harpooneer who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the rope like baleful comet the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailor joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harm s way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale pike calling upon his officer to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarter deck at interval he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperado were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large cask in a line with the windlass these sea parisian entrenched themselves behind the barricade come out of that ye pirate roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come out of that ye cut throat steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistol could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his steelkilt s death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hand fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgent instantly to return to their duty will you promise not to touch u if we do demanded their ringleader turn to turn to i make no promise to your duty do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he once more raised a pistol sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of u turn to unless you swear not to raise a rope yarn against u what say ye men turning to his comrade a fierce cheer wa their response the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentence a these it s not our fault we didn t want it i told him to take his hammer away it wa boy s business he might have known me before this i told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ain t those mincing knife down in the forecastle there men look to those handspike my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word don t be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat u decently and we re your men but we won t be flogged turn to i make no promise turn to i say look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him there are a few of u here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise d ye see now a you well know sir we can claim our discharge a soon a the anchor is down so we don t want a row it s not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we won t be flogged turn to roared the captain steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then said i tell you what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we won t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack u but till you say the word about not flogging u we don t do a hand s turn down into the forecastle then down with ye i ll keep ye there till ye re sick of it down ye go shall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bear into a cave a the lakeman s bare head wa just level with the plank the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hand upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon them ten in number leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral all night a wide awake watch wa kept by all the officer forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it wa feared the insurgent might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hour of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pump whose clinking and clanking at interval through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoner to work but with a yell they refused water wa then lowered down to them and a couple of handful of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter deck twice every day for three day this wa repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling wa heard a the customary summons wa delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fear of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineer bolted up into the air from the desperate arm below that sought to restrain them only three were left better turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer shut u up again will ye cried steelkilt oh certainly said the captain and the key clicked it wa at this point gentleman that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associate and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place a black a the bowel of despair it wa then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knife long crescentic heavy implement with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not that wa the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what wa more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader a fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly a his two comrade would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentleman the foul play of these miscreant must come out upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treachery together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their soul to each other in three sentence and bound the sleeper with cord and gagged him with cord and shrieked out for the captain at midnight thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mate and harpooneer rushed for the forecastle in a few minute the scuttle wa opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader wa shoved up into the air by his perfidious ally who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarter of meat and there they hung till morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them the vulture would not touch ye ye villain at sunrise he summoned all hand and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought upon the whole he would do so he ought to justice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular but a for you ye carrion rogue turning to the three men in the rigging for you i mean to mince ye up for the try pot and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the back of the two traitor till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their head sideways a the two crucified thief are drawn my wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldn t give up take that gag from his mouth and let u hear what he can say for himself for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaw and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss what i say is this and mind it well if you flog me i murder you say ye so then see how ye frighten me and the captain drew off with the rope to strike best not hissed the lakeman but i must and the rope wa once more drawn back for the stroke steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hand started back paced the deck rapidly two or three time and then suddenly throwing down his rope said i won t do it let him go cut him down d ye hear but a the junior mate were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested them radney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene such wa the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe you are a coward hissed the lakeman so i am but take that the mate wa in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilt s threat whatever that might have been the three men were then cut down all hand were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seaman the iron pump clanged a before just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor wa heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitor running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaty cuff and kick could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ship s run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilt s instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all order to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thing namely not to sing out for whale in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other peril the town ho still maintained her mast head and her captain wa just a willing to lower for a fish that moment a on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate wa quite a ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale but though the lakeman had induced the seaman to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all wa over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricle of his heart he wa in radney the chief mate s watch and a if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstance steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwark of the quarter deck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which wa hoisted up there a little above the ship s side in this attitude it wa well known he sometimes dozed there wa a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this wa the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o clock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watch below what are you making there said a shipmate what do you think what doe it look like like a lanyard for your bag but it s an odd one seems to me yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arm s length before him but i think it will answer shipmate i haven t enough twine have you any but there wa none in the forecastle then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft you don t mean to go a begging to him said a sailor why not do you think he won t do me a turn when it s to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it wa given him neither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman s monkey jacket a he wa tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twenty four hour after his trick at the silent helm nigh to the man who wa apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour wa then to come and in the fore ordaining soul of steelkilt the mate wa already stark and stretched a a corpse with his forehead crushed in but gentleman a fool saved the would be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hand into it own the damning thing he would have done it wa just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the deck that a stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the main chain all at once shouted out there she roll there she roll jesu what a whale it wa moby dick moby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do whale have christening whom call you moby dick a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don but that would be too long a story how how cried all the young spaniard crowding nay don don nay nay i can not rehearse that now let me get more into the air sir the chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend look faint fill up his empty glass no need gentleman one moment and i proceed now gentleman so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yard of the ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast head all wa now a phrensy the white whale the white whale wa the cry from captain mate and harpooneer who undeterred by fearful rumour were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curse the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentleman a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these event a if verily mapped out before the world itself wa charted the mutineer wa the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it wa his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boat were lowered the mate s got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt a he strained at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he wa always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his bandaged cry wa to beach him on the whale s topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whiteness together till of a sudden the boat struck a against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant a he fell on the whale s slippery back the boat righted and wa dashed aside by the swell while radney wa tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant wa dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaw and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down meantime at the first tap of the boat s bottom the lakeman had slackened the line so a to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thought but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale wa free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatter of radney s red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boat gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared in good time the town ho reached her port a savage solitary place where no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palm eventually a it turned out seizing a large double war canoe of the savage and setting sail for some other harbor the ship s company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islander to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous ally wa this small band of white necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme wa the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officer he anchored the ship a far off shore a possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bow stacked his musket on the poop and warning the islander not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred mile distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe wa descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of coral he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked war canoe the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much a clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubble and foam what do you want of me cried the captain where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt no lie i am bound to tahiti for more men very good let me board you a moment i come in peace with that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain cross your arm sir throw back your head now repeat after me a soon a steelkilt leaf me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six day if i do not may lightning strike me a pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrade watching the boat till it wa fairly beached and drawn up to the root of the cocoa nut tree steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended him two ship were about to sail for france and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution some ten day after the french ship sailed the whale boat arrived and the captain wa forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitian who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings where steelkilt now is gentleman none know but upon the island of nantucket the widow of radney still turn to the sea which refuse to give up it dead still in dream see the awful white whale that destroyed him are you through said don sebastian quietly i am don then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own conviction this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to press also bear with all of u sir sailor for we all join in don sebastian s suit cried the company with exceeding interest is there a copy of the holy evangelist in the golden inn gentleman nay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised this may grow too serious will you be so good a to bring the priest also don though there are no auto da f s in lima now said one of the company to another i fear our sailor friend run risk of the archiepiscopacy let u withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need of this excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelist you can this is the priest he brings you the evangelist said don sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it so help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye gentleman is in substance and it great item true i know it to be true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney chapter of the monstrous picture of whale i shall ere long paint to you a well a one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale a he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portrait of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such picture of the whale all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusion will be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculpture for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous time when on the marble panelling of temple the pedestal of statue and on shield medallion cup and coin the dolphin wa drawn in scale of chain armor like saladin s and a helmeted head like st george s ever since then ha something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular picture of the whale but in many scientific presentation of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale s is to be found in the famous cavern pagoda of elephanta in india the brahmin maintain that in the almost endless sculpture of that immemorial pagoda all the trade and pursuit every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured age before any of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known a the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so a only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong it look more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palm of the true whale s majestic fluke but go to the old gallery and look now at a great christian painter s portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is guido s picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the sea monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange creature a that nor doe hogarth in painting the same scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it ha a sort of howdah on it back and it distended tusked mouth into which the billow are rolling might be taken for the traitor gate leading from the thames by water into the tower then there are the prodromus whale of old scotch sibbald and jonah s whale a depicted in the print of old bible and the cut of old primer what shall be said of these a for the book binder s whale winding like a vine stalk round the stock of a descending anchor a stamped and gilded on the back and title page of many book both old and new that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figure on antique vas though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this book binder s fish an attempt at a whale because it wa so intended when the device wa first introduced it wa introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the th century during the revival of learning and in those day and even down to a comparatively late period dolphin were popularly supposed to be a specie of the leviathan in the vignette and other embellishment of some ancient book you will at time meet with very curious touch at the whale where all manner of spout jet d eau hot spring and cold saratoga and baden baden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the title page of the original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some curious whale but quitting all these unprofessional attempt let u glance at those picture of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineation by those who know in old harris s collection of voyage there are some plate of whale extracted from a dutch book of voyage a d entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plate the whale like great raft of log are represented lying among ice isle with white bear running over their living back in another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular fluke then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn into the south sea for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fishery in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marine to mention but one thing about it let me say that it ha an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow window some five foot long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give u jonah looking out of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilation of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake look at that popular work goldsmith s animated nature in the abridged london edition of there are plate of an alleged whale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale look much like an amputated sow and a for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboy then again in bernard germain count de lac p de a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several picture of the different specie of the leviathan all these are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man a touching that specie declares not to have it counterpart in nature but the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blundering business wa reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron in he published a natural history of whale in which he give what he call a picture of the sperm whale before showing that picture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier s sperm whale is not a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell perhaps he got it a his scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortion that is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lad with the pencil those chinese are many queer cup and saucer inform u a for the sign painter whale seen in the street hanging over the shop of oil dealer what shall be said of them they are generally richard iii whale with dromedary hump and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tart that is whaleboat full of mariner their deformity floundering in sea of blood and blue paint but these manifold mistake in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawing have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about a correct a a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all it undashed pride of hull and spar though elephant have stood for their full length the living leviathan ha never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable water and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched line of battle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so a to preserve all his mighty swell and undulation and not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full grown platonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whale hoisted to a ship s deck such is then the outlandish eel like limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hint may be derived touching his true form not at all for it is one of the more curious thing about this leviathan that his skeleton give very little idea of his general shape though jeremy bentham s skeleton which hang for candelabra in the library of one of his executor correctly conveys the idea of a burly browed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremy s other leading personal characteristic yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan s articulated bone in fact a the great hunter say the mere skeleton of the whale bear the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal a the insect doe to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelope it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head a in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin the bone of which almost exactly answer to the bone of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin ha four regular bone finger the index middle ring and little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering a the human finger in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve u said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle u without mitten for all these reason then any way you may look at it you must need conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really look like and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan chapter of the less erroneous picture of whale and the true picture of whaling scene in connexion with the monstrous picture of whale i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous story of them which are to be found in certain book both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pas that matter by i know of only four published outline of the great sperm whale colnett s huggins s frederick cuvier s and beale s in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to huggins s is far better than theirs but by great odds beale s is the best all beale s drawing of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whale in various attitude capping his second chapter his frontispiece boat attacking sperm whale though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and life like in it general effect some of the sperm whale drawing in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though of the right whale the best outline picture are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he ha but one picture of whaling scene and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such picture only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale a seen by his living hunter but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some detail not the most correct presentation of whale and whaling scene to be anywhere found are two large french engraving well executed and taken from painting by one garnery respectively they represent attack on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundity of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven plank the prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monster s spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping a if from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true the half emptied line tub float on the whitened sea the wooden pole of the spilled harpoon obliquely bob in it the head of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expression of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical detail of this whale but let that pas since for the life of me i could not draw so good a one in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that roll his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from the patagonian cliff his jet are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowel below sea fowl are pecking at the small crab shell fish and other sea candy and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carry on his pestilent back and all the while the thick lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving ton of tumultuous white curd in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swell like a skiff caught nigh the paddle wheel of an ocean steamer thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sail of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale pole inserted into his spout hole who garnery the painter is or wa i know not but my life for it he wa either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lad for painting action go and gaze upon all the painting of europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas a in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fight his way pell mell through the consecutive great battle of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern light and the successive armed king and emperor dash by like a charge of crowned centaur not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battle piece of garnery the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of thing seems to be peculiarly evinced in what painting and engraving they have of their whaling scene with not one tenth of england s experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the american they have nevertheless furnished both nation with the only finished sketch at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale draughtsman seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of thing such a the vacant profile of the whale which so far a picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving u a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniature of narwhale and porpoise treat u to a series of classical engraving of boat hook chopping knife and grapnel and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety six fac simile of magnified arctic snow crystal i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager i honor him for a veteran but in so important a matter it wa certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace in addition to those fine engraving from garnery there are two other french engraving worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other account it is a quiet noon scene among the isle of the pacific a french whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sail of the ship and the long leaf of the palm in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when considered with reference to it presenting the hardy fisherman under one of their few aspect of oriental repose the other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hove to upon the open sea and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the act of cutting in hove over to the monster a if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whale in the distance the harpoon and lance lie levelled for use three oarsman are just setting the mast in it hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stand half erect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torment of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithy and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squall and rain seems to quicken the activity of the excited seaman chapter of whale in paint in teeth in wood in sheet iron in stone in mountain in star on tower hill a you go down to the london dock you may have seen a crippled beggar or kedger a the sailor say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg there are three whale and three boat and one of the boat presumed to contain the missing leg in all it original integrity is being crunched by the jaw of the foremost whale any time these ten year they tell me ha that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification ha now come his three whale are a good whale a were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump a unquestionable a stump a any you will find in the western clearing but though for ever mounted on that stump never a stump speech doe the poor whaleman make but with downcast eye stand ruefully contemplating his own amputation throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketch of whale and whaling scene graven by the fisherman themselves on sperm whale teeth or lady busks wrought out of the right whale bone and other like skrimshander article a the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivance they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hour of ocean leisure some of them have little box of dentistical looking implement specially intended for the skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their jack knife alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner s fancy long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him i e what is called savagery your true whale hunter is a much a savage a an iroquois i myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibal and ready at any moment to rebel against him now one of the peculiar characteristic of the savage in his domestic hour is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian war club or spear paddle in it full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is a great a trophy of human perseverance a a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken sea shell or a shark s tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden net work ha been achieved and it ha cost steady year of steady application a with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailor savage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single shark s tooth of his one poor jack knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite a workmanlike but a close packed in it maziness of design a the greek savage achilles s shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness a the print of that fine old dutch savage albert durer wooden whale or whale cut in profile out of the small dark slab of the noble south sea war wood are frequently met with in the forecastle of american whaler some of them are done with much accuracy at some old gable roofed country house you will see brass whale hung by the tail for knocker to the road side door when the porter is sleepy the anvil headed whale would be best but these knocking whale are seldom remarkable a faithful essay on the spire of some old fashioned church you will see sheet iron whale placed there for weather cock but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intent and purpose so labelled with hand off you can not examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit in bony ribby region of the earth where at the base of high broken cliff mass of rock lie strewn in fantastic grouping upon the plain you will often discover image a of the petrified form of the leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day break against them in a surf of green surge then again in mountainous country where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical height here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpse of the profile of whale defined along the undulating ridge but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sight and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand point else so chance like are such observation of the hill that your precise previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the soloma island which still remain incognita though once high ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whale in the starry heaven and boat in pursuit of them a when long filled with thought of war the eastern nation saw army locked in battle among the cloud thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolution of the bright point that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic sky i have boarded the argo navis and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish with a frigate s anchor for my bridle bitt and fasces of harpoon for spur would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost sky to see whether the fabled heaven with all their countless tent really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight chapter brit steering north eastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadow of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feed for league and league it undulated round u so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless field of ripe and golden wheat on the second day number of right whale were seen who secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaw sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibre of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouth wa in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip a morning mower who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythe through the long wet grass of marshy mead even so these monster swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swath of blue upon the yellow sea that part of the sea known among whalemen a the brazil bank doe not bear that name a the bank of newfoundland do because of there being shallow and sounding there but because of this remarkable meadow like appearance caused by the vast drift of brit continually floating in those latitude where the right whale is often chased but it wa only the sound they made a they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mower seen from the mast head especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black form looked more like lifeless mass of rock than anything else and a in the great hunting country of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pas on the plain recumbent elephant without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevation of the soil even so often with him who for the first time beholds this specie of the leviathan of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense magnitude render it very hard really to believe that such bulky mass of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all part with the same sort of life that life in a dog or a horse indeed in other respect you can hardly regard any creature of the deep with the same feeling that you do those of the shore for though some old naturalist have maintained that all creature of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialty where for example doe the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answer to the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him but though to landsman in general the native inhabitant of the sea have ever been regarded with emotion unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown world to discover his one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific of all mortal disaster have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen ten and hundred of thousand of those who have gone upon the water though but a moment s consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impression man ha lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much a a widow that same ocean roll now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ship of last year yea foolish mortal noah s flood is not yet subsided two third of the fair world it yet cover wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other preternatural terror rested upon the hebrew when under the foot of korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever set but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallow up ship and crew but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is also a fiend to it own off spring worse than the persian host who murdered his own guest sparing not the creature which itself hath spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlay her own cub so the sea dash even the mightiest whale against the rock and leaf them there side by side with the split wreck of ship no mercy no power but it own control it panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that ha lost it rider the masterless ocean overrun the globe consider the subtleness of the sea how it most dreaded creature glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tint of azure consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of it most remorseless tribe a the dainty embellished shape of many specie of shark consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creature prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself for a this appalling ocean surround the verdant land so in the soul of man there lie one insular tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horror of the half known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst never return chapter squid slowly wading through the meadow of brit the pequod still held on her way north eastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering mast mildly waved to that languid breeze a three mild palm on a plain and still at wide interval in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burnished sun glade on the water seemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered wave whispered together a they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre wa seen by daggoo from the main mast head in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snow slide new slid from the hill thus glistening for a moment a slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on re appearing once more with a stiletto like cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled out there there again there she breach right ahead the white whale the white whale upon this the seaman rushed to the yard arm a in swarming time the bee rush to the bough bare headed in the sultry sun ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his order to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he wa now prepared to connect the idea of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued however this wa or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave order for lowering the four boat were soon on the water ahab s in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oar suspended we were awaiting it reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thought of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret sea have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlong in length and breadth of a glancing cream colour lay floating on the water innumerable long arm radiating from it centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anaconda a if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billow an unearthly formless chance like apparition of life a with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated water where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimed almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost what wa it sir said flask the great live squid which they say few whale ship ever beheld and returned to their port to tell of it but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest a silently following whatever superstition the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance ha gone far to invest it with portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague idea concerning it true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food for though other specie of whale find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zone below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists at time when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arm of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty foot in length they fancy that the monster to which these arm belonged ordinarily cling by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other specie is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in which the bishop describes it a alternately rising and sinking with some other particular he narrates in all this the two correspond but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it by some naturalist who have vaguely heard rumor of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttle fish to which indeed in certain external respect it would seem to belong but only a the anak of the tribe chapter the line with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described a well a for the better understanding of all similar scene elsewhere presented i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale line the line originally used in the fishery wa of the best hemp slightly vapored with tar not impregnated with it a in the case of ordinary rope for while tar a ordinarily used make the hemp more pliable to the rope maker and also render the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected but a most seaman are beginning to learn tar in general by no mean add to the rope s durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss of late year the manilla rope ha in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp a a material for whale line for though not so durable a hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an sthetics in all thing is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla is a a golden haired circassian to behold the whale line is only two third of an inch in thickness at first sight you would not think it so strong a it really is by experiment it one and fifty yarn will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pound so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three ton in length the common sperm whale line measure something over two hundred fathom towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the worm pipe of a still though but so a to form one round cheese shaped mass of densely bedded sheaf or layer of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese a the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebody s arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in it tub some harpooneer will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so a in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkle and twist in the english boat two tub are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tub there is some advantage in this because these twin tub being so small they fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly three foot in diameter and of proportionate depth make a rather bulky freight for a craft whose plank are but one half inch in thickness for the bottom of the whale boat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line tub the boat look a if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding cake to present to the whale both end of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eye splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over it edge completely disengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two account first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep a to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instance the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale a it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist it consort second this arrangement is indispensable for common safety s sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute a he sometimes doe he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no town crier would ever find her again before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man s oar so that it jog against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men a they alternately sit at the opposite gunwale to the leaded chock or groove in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chock it hang in a slight festoon over the bow and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathom called box line being coiled upon the box in the bow it continues it way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is then attached to the short warp the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the short warp go through sundry mystification too tedious to detail thus the whale line fold the whole boat in it complicated coil twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the oarsman are involved in it perilous contortion so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem a indian juggler with the deadliest snake sportively festooning their limb nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacy and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortion be put in play like ringed lightning he can not be thus circumstanced without a shudder that make the very marrow in his bone to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habit strange thing what can not habit accomplish gayer sally more merry mirth better joke and brighter repartee you never heard over your mahogany than you will hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat when thus hung in hangman s noose and like the six burgher of calais before king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaw of death with a halter around every neck a you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disaster some few of which are casually chronicled of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam engine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for you can not sit motionless in the heart of these peril because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain self adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the all seeing sun himself could never pierce you out again a the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself a the seemingly harmless rifle hold the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line a it silently serpentines about the oarsman before being brought into actual play this is a thing which carry more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men live enveloped in whale line all are born with halter round their neck but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortal realize the silent subtle ever present peril of life and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whale boat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side chapter stubb kill a whale if to starbuck the apparition of the squid wa a thing of portent to queequeg it wa quite a different object when you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale the next day wa exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the pequod s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpse of porpoise dolphin flying fish and other vivacious denizen of more stirring water than those off the rio de la plata or the in shore ground off peru it wa my turn to stand at the foremast head and with my shoulder leaning against the slackened royal shroud to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway a a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seaman at the main and mizzen mast head were already drowsy so that at last all three of u lifelessly swung from the spar and for every swing that we made there wa a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman the wave too nodded their indolent crest and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all suddenly bubble seemed bursting beneath my closed eye like vice my hand grasped the shroud some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathom off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the sun s ray like a mirror but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale wa thy last a if struck by some enchanter s wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voice from all part of the vessel simultaneously with the three note from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry a the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air clear away the boat luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spoke the sudden exclamation of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boat were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripple a he swam that thinking after all he might not a yet be alarmed ahab gave order that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whisper so seated like ontario indian on the gunwale of the boat we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sail being set presently a we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty foot into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up there go fluke wa the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite wa granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smoker s boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honor of the capture it wa obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuer all silence of cautiousness wa therefore no longer of use paddle were dropped and oar came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy he wa going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale s enormous head consists though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably doe so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cut water formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot boat start her start her my men don t hurry yourselves take plenty of time but start her start her like thunder clap that s all cried stubb spluttering out the smoke a he spoke start her now give em the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boy start her all but keep cool keep cool cucumber is the word easy easy only start her like grim death and grinning devil and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graf boy that s all start her woo hoo wa hee screamed the gay header in reply raising some old war whoop to the sky a every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave but his wild scream were answered by others quite a wild kee hee kee hee yelled daggoo straining forward and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage ka la koo loo howled queequeg a if smacking his lip over a mouthful of grenadier s steak and thus with oar and yell the keel cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth like desperado they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry wa heard stand up tashtego give it to him the harpoon wa hurled stern all the oarsman backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrist it wa the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turn with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of it increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fume from his pipe a the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb s hand from which the hand cloth or square of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these time had accidentally dropped it wa like holding an enemy s sharp two edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed sea water into it more turn were taken so that the line began holding it place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fin stubb and tashtego here changed place stem for stern a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop wa used to dash the running line with water in many other ship a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from it now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keel one cleaving the water the other the air a the boat churned on through both opposing element at once a continual cascade played at the bow a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantic and pacific seemed passed a they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight haul in haul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hand began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat wa being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale s horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling the red tide now poured from all side of the monster like brook down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlong behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back it reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after jet of white smoke wa agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman a at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blow against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale pull up pull up he now cried to the bowsman a the waning whale relaxed in his wrath pull up close to and the boat ranged along the fish s flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning a if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he wa fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought wa the innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout hole with sharp cracking agonized respiration at last gush after gush of clotted red gore a if it had been the purple lee of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flank into the sea his heart had burst he s dead mr stubb said daggoo yes both pipe smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ash over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made chapter the dart a word concerning an incident in the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale boat push off from the ship with the headsman or whale killer a temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whale fastener pulling the foremost oar the one known a the harpooneer oar now it need a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement ha to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty foot but however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamation and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one s compass while all the other muscle are strained and half started what that is none know but those who have tried it for one i can not bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry stand up and give it to him he now ha to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essay to pitch it somehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty fair chance for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneer are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood vessel in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four year with four barrel no wonder that to many ship owner whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that make the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale start to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else it is then they change place and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft take his proper station in the bow of the boat now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bow from first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstance obvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation ha convinced me that in the vast majority of failure in the fishery it ha not by any mean been so much the speed of the whale a the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that ha caused them to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneer of this world must start to their foot from out of idleness and not from out of toil chapter the crotch out of the trunk the branch grow out of them the twig so in productive subject grow the chapter the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two foot in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly project from the prow thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to it hurler who snatch it up a readily from it rest a a backwoodsman swing his rifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoon reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second iron but these two harpoon each by it own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chance but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightning like in his movement to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless a the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all event be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hand tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such case the spare coil of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instance prudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualty furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharp edged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the line or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all direction nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse consider now how it must be in the case of four boat all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these quality in him a well a to the thousand concurring accident of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second iron may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied with several harpoon to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particular are faithfully narrated here a they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passage in scene hereafter to be painted chapter stubb s supper stubb s whale had been killed some distance from the ship it wa a calm so forming a tandem of three boat we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now a we eighteen men with our thirty six arm and one hundred and eighty thumb and finger slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long interval good evidence wa hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hang ho or whatever they call it in china four or five laborer on the foot path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along a if laden with pig lead in bulk darkness came on but three light up and down in the pequod s main rigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lantern over the bulwark vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual order for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature wa dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him a if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick wa yet to be slain and though a thousand other whale were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod s deck that all hand were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chain are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the port hole but by those clanking link the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bow the whale now lie with it black hull close to the vessel s and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spar and rigging aloft the two ship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullock whereof one reclines while the other remains standing a little item may a well be related here the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship ha upon the whale when moored alongside is by the fluke or tail and a from it greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side fin it flexibility even in death cause it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you can not get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at it outer end and a weight in it middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with it broad fluke or lobe if moody ahab wa now all quiescence at least so far a could be known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still good natured excitement such an unwonted bustle wa he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affair one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb wa soon made strangely manifest stubb wa a high liver he wa somewhat intemperately fond of the whale a a flavorish thing to his palate a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small here be it known that though these wild fisherman do not a a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expense of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak wa cut and cooked and lighted by two lantern of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan head a if that capstan were a sideboard nor wa stubb the only banqueter on whale s flesh that night mingling their mumbling with his own mastication thousand on thousand of shark swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on it fatness the few sleeper below in their bunk were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tail against the hull within a few inch of the sleeper heart peering over the side you could just see them a before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black water and turning over on their back a they scooped out huge globular piece of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthful remains a part of the universal problem of all thing the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight shark will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship s deck like hungry dog round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butcher over the deck table are thus cannibally carving each other s live meat with carving knife all gilded and tasselled the shark also with their jewel hilted mouth are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all party and though shark also are the invariable outrider of all slave ship crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instance might be set down touching the set term place and occasion when shark do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless number and in gayer or more jovial spirit than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil worship and the expediency of conciliating the devil but a yet stubb heeded not the mumbling of the banquet that wa going on so nigh him no more than the shark heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lip cook cook where s that old fleece he cried at length widening his leg still further a if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish a if stabbing with his lance cook you cook sail this way cook the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old black there wa something the matter with his knee pan which he did not keep well scoured like his other pan this old fleece a they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoop this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb s sideboard when with both hand folded before him and resting on his two legged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so a to bring his best ear into play cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth don t you think this steak is rather overdone you ve been beating this steak too much cook it s

over the sea so a to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the shark while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that wa said fellow critter i se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin ob de lip massa stubb say dat you can fill

stood before there over against me and pay particular attention all dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you cook what dat do wid de teak said the old black testily silence how old are you cook bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred year cook and don t know yet how to cook a whale steak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a

be take it i say holding the tongs towards him take it and taste it faintly smacking his withered lip over it for a moment the old negro muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the church passed one once in cape down said the old man sullenly and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape town where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearer a his beloved fellow creature have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie a you did just now eh said stubb where do you expect to go to cook go to bed berry soon he mumbled half turning a he spoke avast heave to i mean when you die cook it s an awful question now what s your answer when dis old brack man dy said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor he hisself won t go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch him fetch him how in a coach and four a they fetched elijah and fetch him where

then halloa stop make a bow before you go avast heaving again whale ball for breakfast don t forget wish by gor whale eat him stead of him eat whale i m bressed if he ain t more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock chapter the whale a a dish that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feed his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light a you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must need go a little into the history and philosophy of it it is upon record that three century ago the tongue of the right whale wa esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large price there also that in henry viiith s time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoise which you remember are a specie of whale porpoise indeed are to this day considered fine eating the meat is made into ball about the size of billiard ball and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle ball or veal ball the old monk of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the crown the fact is that among his hunter at least the whale would by all hand be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meat pie nearly one hundred foot long it take away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whale but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whale and have rare old vintage of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doctor recommends strip of blubber for infant a being exceedingly juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishman who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel that these men actually lived for several month on the mouldy scrap of whale which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scrap are called fritter which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old amsterdam housewife dough nut or oly cook when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most self denying stranger can hardly keep his hand off but what further depreciates the whale a a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which would be a fine eating a the buffalo s which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent half jellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of it growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watch of the night it is a common thing for the seaman to dip their ship biscuit into the huge oil pot and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made in the case of a small sperm whale the brain are accounted a fine dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobe being withdrawn precisely resembling two large pudding they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calf head which is quite a dish among some epicure and every one know that some young buck among the epicure by continually dining upon calf brain by and by get to have a little brain of their own so a to be able to tell a calf s head from their own head which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf s head before him is somehow one of the saddest sight you can see the head look a sort of reproachfully at him with an et tu brute expression it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsman seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned i e that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by it own light but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox wa regarded a a murderer perhaps he wa hung and if he had been put on his trial by ox he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer doe go to the meat market of a saturday night and see the crowd of live biped staring up at the long row of dead quadruped doe not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal s jaw cannibal who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest goose to the ground and feastest on their bloated liver in thy pat de foie gras but stubb he eats the whale by it own light doe he and that is adding insult to injury is it look at your knife handle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made of what but the bone of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to gander formally indite his circular it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pen chapter the shark massacre when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not a a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires all hand to set about it therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm a lee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchor watch shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all go well but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable host of shark gather round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hour say on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning in most other part of the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at time considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling spade a procedure notwithstanding which in some instance only seems to tickle them into still greater activity but it wa not thus in the present case with the pequod s shark though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sight to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea wa one huge cheese and those shark the maggot in it nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchor watch after his supper wa concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitement wa created among the shark for immediately suspending the cutting stage over the side and lowering three lantern so that they cast long gleam of light over the turbid sea these two mariner darting their long whaling spade kept up an incessant murdering of the shark by striking the keen steel deep into their skull seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling host the marksman could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelation of the incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each other s disembowelment but like flexible bow bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor wa this all it wa unsafe to meddle with the corps and ghost of these creature a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joint and bone after what might be called the individual life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these shark almost took poor queequeg s hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw the whaling spade used for cutting in is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a man s spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only it side are perfectly flat and it upper end considerably narrower than the lower this weapon is always kept a sharp a possible and when being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in it socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty foot long is inserted for a handle queequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly lifting his hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin chapter cutting in it wa a saturday night and such a sabbath a followed ex officio professor of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod wa turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red ox to the sea god in the first place the enormous cutting tackle among other ponderous thing comprising a cluster of block generally painted green and which no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grape wa swayed up to the main top and firmly lashed to the lower mast head the strongest point anywhere above a ship s deck the end of the hawser like rope winding through these intricacy wa then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackle wa swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pound wa attached and now suspended in stage over the side starbuck and stubb the mate armed with their long spade began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side fin this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship careen over on her side every bolt in her start like the nail head of an old house in frosty weather she tremble quiver and nod her frighted mast head to the sky more and more she lean over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billow till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship roll upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rise into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now a the blubber envelope the whale precisely a the rind doe an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely a an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keep the whale rolling over and over in the water and a the blubber in one strip uniformly peel off along the line called the scarf simultaneously cut by the spade of starbuck and stubb the mate and just a fast a it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till it upper end graz the main top the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blood dripping mass sway to and fro a if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swing else it may box his ear and pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneer now advance with a long keen weapon called a boarding sword and watching his chance he dexterously slice out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so a to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hand to stand off once more make a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicing severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanket piece swing clear and is all ready for lowering the heaver forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down go the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber room into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hand keep coiling away the long blanket piece a if it were a great live mass of plaited serpent and thus the work proceeds the two tackle hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heaver singing the blubber room gentleman coiling the mate scarfing the ship straining and all hand swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction chapter the blanket i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale i have had controversy about it with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalist ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence of firm close grained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and range from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inch in thickness now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature s skin a being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fact these are no argument against such a presumption because you can not raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale s body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shred of isinglass only it is almost a flexible and soft a satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contract and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bit which i use for mark in my whale book it is transparent a i said before and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whale through their own spectacle a you may say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded a the skin of the creature a the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new born child but no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin a in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrel of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in it expressed state is only three fourth and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yield such a lake of liquid a that reckoning ten barrel to the ton you have ten ton for the net weight of only three quarter of the stuff of the whale s skin in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvel he present almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re crossed with numberless straight mark in thick array something like those in the finest italian line engraving but these mark do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it a if they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some instance to the quick observant eye those linear mark a in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineation these are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cypher on the wall of pyramid hieroglyphic then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphic upon one sperm whale in particular i wa much struck with a plate representing the old indian character chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisade on the bank of the upper mississippi like those mystic rock too the mystic marked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian rock reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomenon which the exterior of the sperm whale present he not seldom display the back and more especially his flank effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratch altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new england rock on the sea coast which agassiz imago to bear the mark of violent scraping contact with vast floating iceberg i should say that those rock must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me that such scratch in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whale for i have most remarked them in the large full grown bull of the specie a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale it ha already been said that it is stript from him in long piece called blanket piece like most sea term this one is very happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber a in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weather in all sea time and tide what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy sea of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean water but these be it observed are your cold blooded lungless fish whose very belly are refrigerator creature that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg a a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale ha lung and warm blood freeze his blood and he dy how wonderful is it then except after explanation that this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is a indispensable a it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lip for life in those arctic water where when seaman fall overboard they are sometimes found month afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the heart of field of ice a a fly is found glued in amber but more surprising is it to know a ha been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer it doe seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick wall and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peter s and like the great whale retain o man in all season a temperature of thine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine thing of erection how few are domed like st peter s of creature how few vast a the whale chapter the funeral haul in the chain let the carcase go astern the vast tackle have now done their duty the peeled white body of the beheaded whale flash like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it ha not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal slowly it float more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate shark and the air above vexed with rapacious flight of screaming fowl whose beak are like so many insulting poniard in the whale the vast white headless phantom float further and further from the ship and every rod that it so float what seem square rood of shark and cubic rood of fowl augment the murderous din for hour and hour from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breeze that great mass of death float on and on till lost in infinite perspective there s a most doleful and most mocking funeral the sea vulture all in pious mourning the air shark all punctiliously in black or speckled in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free nor is this the end desecrated a the body is a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare espied by some timid man of war or blundering discovery vessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowl nevertheless still show the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whale s unharming corpse with trembling finger is set down in the log shoal rock and breaker hereabouts beware and for year afterwards perhaps ship shun the place leaping over it a silly sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there when a stick wa held there s your law of precedent there s your utility of tradition there s the story of your obstinate survival of old belief never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air there s orthodoxy thus while in life the great whale s body may have been a real terror to his foe in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world are you a believer in ghost my friend there are other ghost than the cock lane one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in them chapter the sphynx it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan he wa beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeon very much pride themselves and not without reason consider that the whale ha nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten foot intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstance he ha to cut many foot deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much a getting one single peep into the ever contracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted part and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by it insertion into the skull do you not marvel then at stubb s boast that he demanded but ten minute to behead a sperm whale when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whale s head embrace nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden a that even by the immense tackle of a whaler this were a vain a thing a to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jeweller scale the pequod s whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head wa hoisted against the ship s side about half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by it native element and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast head and every yard arm on that side projecting like a crane over the wave there that blood dripping head hung to the pequod s waist like the giant holofernes s from the girdle of judith when this last task wa accomplished it wa noon and the seaman went below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus wa more and more unfolding it noiseless measureless leaf upon the sea a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin taking a few turn on the quarter deck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the main chain he took stubb s long spade still remaining there after the whale s decapitation and striking it into the lower part of the half suspended mass placed it other end crutch wise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eye attentively fixed on this head it wa a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the sphynx s in the desert speak thou vast and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with moss speak mighty head and tell u the secret thing that is in thee of all diver thou hast dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleam ha moved amid this world s foundation where unrecorded name and navy rust and untold hope and anchor rot where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bone of million of the drowned there in that awful water land there wa thy most familiar home thou hast been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailor s side where sleepless mother would give their life to lay them down thou saw st the locked lover when leaping from their flaming ship heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when heaven seemed false to them thou saw st the murdered mate when tossed by pirate from the midnight deck for hour he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderer still sailed on unharmed while swift lightning shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arm o head thou hast seen enough to split the planet and make an infidel of abraham and not one syllable is thine sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the main mast head aye well now that s cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting himself while whole thunder cloud swept aside from his brow that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man where away three point on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to u better and better man would now st paul would come along that way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogy not the smallest atom stir or life on matter but ha it cunning duplicate in mind chapter the jeroboam s story hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the pequod began to rock by and by through the glass the stranger s boat and manned mast head proved her a whale ship but a she wa so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal wa set to see what response would be made here be it said that like the vessel of military marine the ship of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signal being collected in a book with the name of the respective vessel attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale commander are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distance and with no small facility the pequod s signal wa at last responded to by the stranger s setting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring her yard she bore down ranged abeam under the pequod s lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but a the side ladder wa being rigged by starbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain wa fearful of infecting the pequod s company for though himself and boat s crew remained untainted and though his ship wa half a rifle shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod but this did by no mean prevent all communication preserving an interval of some few yard between itself and the ship the jeroboam s boat by the occasional use of it oar contrived to keep parallel to the pequod a she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her main topsail aback though indeed at time by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearing again subject to this and other the like interruption now and then a conversation wa sustained between the two party but at interval not without still another interruption of a very different sort pulling an oar in the jeroboam s boat wa a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notability make up all totality he wa a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with freckle and wearing redundant yellow hair a long skirted cabalistically cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeve of which were rolled up on his wrist a deep settled fanatic delirium wa in his eye so soon a this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimed that s he that s he the long togged scaramouch the town ho s company told u of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spoke the town ho according to this account and what wa subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story wa this he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shaker where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meeting having several time descended from heaven by the way of a trap door announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vest pocket but which instead of containing gunpowder wa supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady common sense exterior and offered himself a a green hand candidate for the jeroboam s whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon the ship s getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet he announced himself a the archangel gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth a the deliverer of the isle of the sea and vicar general of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these thing the dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terror of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the mind of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of him a such a man however wa not of much practical use in the ship especially a he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individual s intention wa to land him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seal and vial devoting the ship and all hand to unconditional perdition in case this intention wa carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciple among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel wa sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he wa therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pas that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all this wa that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mate and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague a he called it wa at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailor mostly poor devil cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his instruction sometimes rendering him personal homage a to a god such thing may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatic half so striking in respect to the measureless self deception of the fanatic himself a his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the pequod i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwark to captain mayhew who stood in the boat s stern come on board but now gabriel started to his foot think think of the fever yellow and bilious beware of the horrible plague gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and it seethings drowned all speech hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted back think think of thy whale boat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible tail i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead a if dragged by fiend nothing wa said for some moment while a succession of riotous wave rolled by which by one of those occasional caprice of the sea were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm whale s head jogged about very violently and gabriel wa seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant when this interlude wa over captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruption from gabriel whenever his name wa mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whale ship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shaker receiving the bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick wa fairly sighted from the mast head macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangel s denunciation and forewarning macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onset he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to the main royal mast head wa tossing one arm in frantic gesture and hurling forth prophecy of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailant of his divinity now while macey the mate wa standing up in his boat s bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe wa venting his wild exclamation upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by it quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the body of the oarsman next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life wa smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yard not a chip of the boat wa harmed nor a hair of any oarsman s head but the mate for ever sank it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accident in the sperm whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost a frequent a any sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boat s bow is knocked off or the thigh board in which the headsman stand is torn from it place and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instance than one when the body ha been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead the whole calamity with the falling form of macey wa plainly descried from the ship raising a piercing shriek the vial the vial gabriel called off the terror stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciple believed that he had specifically fore announced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many mark in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such question to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab answered aye straightway then gabriel once more started to his foot glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed finger think think of the blasphemer dead and down there beware of the blasphemer s end ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have just bethought me of my letter bag there is a letter for one of thy officer if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag every whale ship take out a goodly number of letter for various ship whose delivery to the person to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four ocean thus most letter never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three year or more soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it wa sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the post boy can st not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye it s but a dim scrawl what s this a he wa studying it out starbuck took a long cutting spade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without it coming any closer to the ship meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr har yes mr harry a woman s pinny hand the man s wife i ll wager aye mr harry macey ship jeroboam why it s macey and he s dead poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let me have it nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going that way curse throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbuck s hand he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat but a he did so the oarsman expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ship s stern so that a if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel s eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boat knife and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahab s foot then gabriel shrieked out to his comrade to give way with their oar and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod a after this interlude the seaman resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange thing were hinted in reference to this wild affair chapter the monkey rope in the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forward among the crew now hand are wanted here and then again hand are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything ha to be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavor the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it wa mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale s back the blubber hook wa inserted into the original hole there cut by the spade of the mate but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass a that same hook get fixed in that hole it wa inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it wa a harpooneer to descend upon the monster s back for the special purpose referred to but in very many case circumstance require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded the whale be it observed lie almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate part operated upon so down there some ten foot below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounder about half on the whale and half in the water a the vast mass revolves like a tread mill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costume a shirt and sock in which to my eye at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him a will presently be seen being the savage s bowsman that is the person who pulled the bow oar in his boat the second one from forward it wa my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard scrabble scramble upon the dead whale s back you have seen italian organ boy holding a dancing ape by a long cord just so from the ship s steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey rope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist it wa a humorously perilous business for both of u for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkey rope wa fast at both end fast to queequeg s broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united u queequeg wa my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liability which the hempen bond entailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motion i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality wa now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that another s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death therefore i saw that here wa a sort of interregnum in providence for it even handed equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further pondering while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam him still further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine wa the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most case he one way or other ha this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortal if your banker break you snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pill you die true you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chance of life but handle queequeg s monkey rope heedfully a i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it the monkey rope is found in all whaler but it wa only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original usage wa introduced by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey rope holder i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this wa not the only jamming jeopardy he wa exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the shark now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creature swarmed round it like bee in a beehive and right in among those shark wa queequeg who often pushed them aside with his floundering foot a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey a a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkey rope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark he wa provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stage tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale spade wherewith they slaughtered a many shark a they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure wa very disinterested and benevolent of them they meant queequeg s best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the shark were at time half hidden by the blood muddled water those indiscreet spade of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hook poor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his yojo and gave up his life into the hand of his god well well my dear comrade and twin brother thought i a i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matter it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of u men in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those shark your foe those spade your friend and what between shark and spade you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now a with blue lip and blood shot eye the exhausted savage at last climb up the chain and stand all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advance and with a benevolent consolatory glance hand him what some hot cognac no hand him ye god hand him a cup of tepid ginger and water ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near yes this must be ginger peering into the a yet untasted cup then standing a if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me mr dough boy where lie the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use dough boy to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ginger what the devil is ginger sea coal firewood lucifer match tinder gunpowder what the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please then watching the mate s countenance he added the steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitter by which he blow back the life into a half drowned man i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough aye aye steward cried stubb we ll teach you to drug a harpooneer none of your apothecary s medicine here you want to poison u do ye you have got out insurance on our life and want to murder u all and pocket the proceeds do ye it wa not me cried dough boy it wa aunt charity that brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneer any spirit but only this ginger jub so she called it ginger jub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the locker and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captain s order grog for the harpooneer on a whale enough replied starbuck only don t hit him again but oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellow s a weazel what were you about saying sir only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea caddy in the other the first contained strong spirit and wa handed to queequeg the second wa aunt charity s gift and that wa freely given to the wave chapter stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk over him it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale s prodigious head hanging to the pequod s side but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matter press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackle may hold now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by it occasional patch of yellow brit gave unusual token of the vicinity of right whale a specie of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near and though all hand commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creature and though the pequod wa not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed number of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement wa made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered nor wa this long wanting tall spout were seen to leeward and two boat stubb s and flask s were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast head but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boat must be fast an interval passed and the boat were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemed a if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rod of the plank he wholly disappeared from view a if diving under the keel cut cut wa the cry from the ship to the boat which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel s side but having plenty of line yet in the tub and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so a to get ahead of the ship for a few minute the struggle wa intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oar in another the contending strain threatened to take them under but it wa only a few foot advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor wa felt running like lightning along the keel a the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bow snapping and quivering and so flinging off it dripping that the drop fell like bit of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boat were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boat after him so that they performed a complete circuit meantime they hauled more and more upon their line till close flanking him on both side stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitude of shark that had before swum round the sperm whale s body rushed to the fresh blood that wa spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash a the eager israelite did at the new bursting fountain that poured from the smitten rock at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse while the two headsman were engaged in making fast cord to his fluke and in other way getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them i wonder what the old man want with this lump of foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan want with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boat s bow did you never hear that the ship which but once ha a sperm whale s head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whale s on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize why not i don t know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ship charm but i sometimes think he ll charm the ship to no good at last i don t half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake s head stubb sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwark and no one by look down there flask pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hand aye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship he s the devil i say the reason why you don t see his tail is because he tuck it up out of sight he carry it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it he s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toe of his boot he sleep in his boot don t he he hasn t got any hammock but i ve seen him lay of night in a coil of rigging no doubt and it s because of his cursed tail he coil it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging what s the old man have so much to do with him for striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose bargain about what why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then he ll surrender moby dick pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that i don t know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye why they say a how he went a sauntering into the old flag ship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor wa at home well he wa at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching his hoof up and say i want john what for say the old governor what business is that of yours say the devil getting mad i want to use him take him say the governor and by the lord flask if the devil didn t give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him i ll eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharp ain t you all ready there well then pull ahead and let s get the whale alongside i think i remember some such story a you were telling said flask when at last the two boat were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but i can t remember where three spaniard adventure of those three bloody minded soldadoes did ye read it there flask i guess ye did no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me stubb do you suppose that that devil you wa speaking of just now wa the same you say is now on board the pequod am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesn t the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil wa dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil ha a latch key to get into the admiral s cabin don t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well that s the figure one now take all the hoop in the pequod s hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldn t begin to be fedallah s age nor all the cooper in creation couldn t show hoop enough to make oughts enough but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a sea toss if you got a good chance now if he s so old a all those hoop of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboard tell me that give him a good ducking anyhow but he d crawl back duck him again and keep ducking him suppose he should take it into his head to duck you though yes and drown you what then i should like to see him try it i d give him such a pair of black eye that he wouldn t dare to show his face in the admiral s cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he life and hereabouts on the upper deck where he sneak so much damn the devil flask so you suppose i m afraid of the devil who s afraid of him except the old governor who daresn t catch him and put him in double darbies a he deserves but let him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped he d roast for him there s a governor do you suppose fedallah want to kidnap captain ahab do i suppose it you ll know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp look out on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on i ll just take him by the nape of his neck and say look here beelzebub you don t do it and if he make any fuss by the lord i ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stump do you see and then i rather guess when he find himself docked in that queer fashion he ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his leg and what will you do with the tail stubb do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get home what else now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb mean or not mean here we are at the ship the boat were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chain and other necessary were already prepared for securing him didn t i tell you so said flask yes you ll soon see this right whale s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti s in good time flask s saying proved true a before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale s head now by the counterpoise of both head she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in locke s head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant s and you come back again but in very poor plight thus some mind for ever keep trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunder head overboard and then you will float light and right in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceeding commonly take place a in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lip and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown piece but nothing like this in the present case had been done the carcase of both whale had dropped astern and the head laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening pannier meantime fedallah wa calmly eyeing the right whale s head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkle there to the line in his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the parsee s shadow wa there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahab s a the crew toiled on laplandish speculation were bandied among them concerning all these passing thing chapter the sperm whale s head contrasted view here now are two great whale laying their head together let u join them and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathan the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whale regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extreme of all the known variety of the whale a the external difference between them is mainly observable in their head and a a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod s side and a we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deck where i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these head both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale s which the right whale s sadly lack there is more character in the sperm whale s head a you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fisherman technically call a grey headed whale let u now note what is least dissimilar in these head namely the two most important organ the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whale s jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colt s eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale s eye it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whale s eye corresponds to that of a man s ear and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey object through your ear you would find that you could only command some thirty degree of vision in advance of the straight side line of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two back so to speak but at the same time also two front side front for what is it that make the front of a man what indeed but his eye moreover while in most other animal that i can now think of the eye are so planted a imperceptibly to blend their visual power so a to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whale s eye effectually divided a they are by many cubic foot of solid head which tower between them like a great mountain separating two lake in valley this of course must wholly separate the impression which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentry box with two joined sash for his window but with the whale these two sash are separately inserted making two distinct window but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whale s eye is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scene a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter a touching the leviathan but i must be content with a hint so long a a man s eye are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he can not then help mechanically seeing whatever object are before him nevertheless any one s experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of thing at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two thing however large or however small at one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two object and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner a to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eye in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than man s that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospect one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he can then is it a marvellous a thing in him a if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstration of two distinct problem in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle whim but it ha always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillation of movement displayed by some whale when beset by three or four boat the timidity and liability to queer fright so common to such whale i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite power of vision must involve them but the ear of the whale is full a curious a the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two head for hour and never discover that organ the ear ha no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ear this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former ha an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so a to be quite imperceptible from without is it not curious that so vast a being a the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare s but if his eye were broad a the lens of herschel s great telescope and his ear capacious a the porch of cathedral would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at all why then do you try to enlarge your mind subtilize it let u now with whatever lever and steam engine we have at hand cant over the sperm whale s head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let u hold on here by this tooth and look about u where we are what a really beautiful and chaste looking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy a bridal satin but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so a to get it overhead and expose it row of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such ala it prof to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spike fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathom down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen foot long hanging straight down at right angle with his body for all the world like a ship s jib boom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sort perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinge of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock jaw upon him in most case this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fisherman fashion all sort of curious article including cane umbrella stock and handle to riding whip with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board a if it were an anchor and when the proper time come some few day after the other work queequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentist are set to drawing teeth with a keen cutting spade queequeg lance the gum then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth a michigan ox drag stump of old oak out of wild wood land there are generally forty two teeth in all in old whale much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slab and piled away like joist for building house chapter the right whale s head contrasted view crossing the deck let u now have a good long look at the right whale s head a in general shape the noble sperm whale s head may be compared to a roman war chariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the right whale s head bear a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot toed shoe two hundred year ago an old dutch voyager likened it shape to that of a shoemaker s last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny but a you come nearer to this great head it begin to assume different aspect according to your point of view if you stand on it summit and look at these two f shaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol and these spiracle the aperture in it sounding board then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comb like incrustation on the top of the mass this green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fisher the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eye solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a bird s nest in it crotch at any rate when you watch those live crab that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy ha been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea whose green crown ha been put together for him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenter s measurement about twenty foot long and five foot deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some gallon of oil and more a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an important interval wa sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquake caused the beach to gape over this lip a over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve foot high and run to a pretty sharp angle a if there were a regular ridge pole there while these ribbed arched hairy side present u with those wondrous half vertical scimetar shaped slat of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blind which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned the edge of these bone are fringed with hairy fibre through which the right whale strain the water and in whose intricacy he retains the small fish when openmouthed he go through the sea of brit in feeding time in the central blind of bone a they stand in their natural order there are certain curious mark curve hollow and ridge whereby some whalemen calculate the creature s age a the age of an oak by it circular ring though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it ha the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable in old time there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancy concerning these blind one voyager in purchas call them the wondrous whisker inside of the whale s mouth another hog bristle a third old gentleman in hackluyt us the following elegant language there are about two hundred and fifty fin growing on each side of his upper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth this reminds u that the right whale really ha a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hair on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tuft impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance a every one know these same hog bristle fin whisker blind or whatever you please furnish to the lady their busks and other stiffening contrivance but in this particular the demand ha long been on the decline it wa in queen anne s time that the bone wa in it glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and a those ancient dame moved about gaily though in the jaw of the whale a you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaw for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone but now forget all about blind and whisker for a moment and standing in the right whale s mouth look around you afresh seeing all these colonnade of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon it thousand pipe for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkey the tongue which is glued a it were to the floor of the mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in piece in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before u at a passing glance i should say it wa a six barreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different head to sum up then in the right whale s there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whale s nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blind of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale ha two external spout hole the sperm whale only one look your last now on these venerable hooded head while they yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in following can you catch the expression of the sperm whale s there it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkle in the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie like placidity born of a speculative indifference a to death but mark the other head s expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessel s side so a firmly to embrace the jaw doe not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter year chapter the battering ram ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whale s head i would have you a a sensible physiologist simply particularly remark it front aspect in all it compacted collectedness i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever battering ram power may be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel a to one of the most appalling but not the less true event perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head present an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that the lower part of that front slope considerably backwards so a to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom like lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed a though your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale ha no external nose and that what nose he ha his spout hole is on the top of his head you observe that his eye and ear are at the side of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale s head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty foot from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is a one wad finally though a will soon be revealed it content partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wrap the body of the whale a the rind wrap an orange just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who ha not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebound from it it is a though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horse hoof i do not think that any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiaman chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the dock what do the sailor do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox hide that bravely and uninjured take the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspike and iron crow bar by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but supplementary to this it ha hypothetically occurred to me that a ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraction and a the sperm whale a far a i know ha no such provision in him considering too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swim with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of it envelope considering the unique interior of his head it ha hypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lung celled honeycomb there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so a to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destructive of all element contributes now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swim behind it all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated a piled wood is by the cord and all obedient to one volition a the smallest insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the speciality and concentration of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feat i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eye brow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giant only to encounter how small the chance for the provincial then what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess s veil at lais chapter the great heidelburgh tun now come the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon regarding the sperm whale s head a a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoin whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaw and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bone it broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal part which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics i know not that it ha been defined before a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having it sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both side the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand infiltrated cell of tough elastic white fibre throughout it whole extent the upper part known a the case may be regarded a the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and a that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whale s vast plaited forehead form innumerable strange device for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover a that of heidelburgh wa always replenished with the most excellent of the wine of the rhenish valley so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintage namely the highly prized spermaceti in it absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begin to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoot a when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whale s case generally yield about five hundred gallon of sperm though from unavoidable circumstance considerable of it is spilled leak and dribble away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun wa coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl coloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whale s case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embrace the entire length of the entire top of the head and since a ha been elsewhere set forth the head embrace one third of the whole length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty foot for a good sized whale you have more than twenty six foot for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship s side a in decapitating the whale the operator s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he ha therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out it invaluable content it is this decapitated end of the head also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackle whose hempen combination on one side make quite a wilderness of rope in that quarter thus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous and in this particular instance almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale s great heidelburgh tun is tapped chapter cistern and bucket nimble a a cat tashtego mount aloft and without altering his erect posture run straight out upon the overhanging mainyard arm to the part where it exactly project over the hoisted tun he ha carried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two part travelling through a single sheaved block securing this block so that it hang down from the yard arm he swing one end of the rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then hand over hand down the other part the indian drop through the air till dexterously he land on the summit of the head there still high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously cry he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayer from the top of a tower a short handled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently search for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasure hunter in some old house sounding the wall to find where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious search is over a stout iron bound bucket precisely like a well bucket ha been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hand these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person ha reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guide the bucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seaman at the whip up come the bucket again all bubbling like a dairy maid s pail of new milk carefully lowered from it height the full freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again go through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego ha to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun until some twenty foot of the pole have gone down now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tub had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened whether it wa that tashtego that wild indian wa so heedless and reckless a to let go for a moment his one handed hold on the great cabled tackle suspending the head or whether the place where he stood wa so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reason how it wa exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden a the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up my god poor tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped head foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to his sens swing the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so a the better to secure his slippery hand hold on the whip itself the hoister ran him high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reached it interior bottom meantime there wa a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea a if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it wa only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggle the perilous depth to which he had sunk at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head wa clearing the whip which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackle a sharp cracking noise wa heard and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hook suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook a if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motion of the head come down come down yelled the seaman to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackle so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out in heaven s name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridge there avast how will that help him jamming that iron bound bucket on top of his head avast will ye stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket almost in the same instant with a thunder boom the enormous mass dropped into the sea like niagara s table rock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath a half swinging now over the sailor head and now over the water daggoo through a thick mist of spray wa dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackle while poor buried alive tashtego wa sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a naked figure with a boarding sword in his hand wa for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwark the next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush wa made to the side and every eye counted every ripple a moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hand now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue wave a sight strange to see a an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave both both it is both cried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg wa seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego wa long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunge near it bottom so a to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg wa presented but well knowing that that wa not a it ought to be and might occasion great trouble he had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old way head foremost a for the great head itself that wa doing a well a could be expected and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego wa successfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediment which is a lesson by no mean to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the gay header s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsman though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one s falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the indian s considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale s well but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale wa the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of it lighter content leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well a double welded hammered substance a i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sink in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance wa in the present instance materially counteracted by the other part of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run a you may say yes it wa a running delivery so it wa now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be recalled the delicious death of an ohio honey hunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed how many think ye have likewise fallen into plato s honey head and sweetly perished there chapter the prairie to scan the line of his face or feel the bump on the head of this leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist ha a yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost a hopeful a for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkle on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treat of the various face of men but also attentively study the face of horse bird serpent and fish and dwells in detail upon the modification of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hint touching the phrenological characteristic of other being than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semi science to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all thing i achieve what i can physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he ha no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the feature and since it perhaps most modifies and finally control their combined expression hence it would seem that it entire absence a an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale for a in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open work belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidias s marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportion are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent a on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly boat your noble conception of him are never insulted by the reflection that he ha a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne in some particular perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this aspect is sublime in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull ha a touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defile the elephant s brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is a that great golden seal affixed by the german emperor to their decree it signifies god done this day by my hand but in most creature nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line few are the forehead which like shakespeare s or melancthon s rise so high and descend so low that the eye themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lake and all above them in the forehead s wrinkle you seem to track the antlered thought descending there to drink a the highland hunter track the snow print of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty god like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread power more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eye ear or mouth no face he ha none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddle dumbly lowering with the doom of boat and ship and men nor in profile doe this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed it grandeur doe not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semi crescentic depression in the forehead s middle which in man is lavater s mark of genius but how genius in the sperm whale ha the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their child magian thought they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale ha no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small a to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birth right the merry may day god of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to jove s high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphic but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man s and every being s face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty language could not read the simplest peasant s face in it profounder and more subtle meaning how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whale s brow i but put that brow before you read it if you can chapter the nut if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square in the full grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty foot in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is a the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base but in life a we have elsewhere seen this inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull form a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this crater in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inch in length and a many in depth repose the mere handful of this monster s brain the brain is at least twenty foot from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind it vast outwork like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortification of quebec so like a choice casket is it secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale ha any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic yard of his sperm magazine lying in strange fold course and convolution to their apprehension it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him a the seat of his intelligence it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creature s living intact state is an entire delusion a for his true brain you can then see no indication of it nor feel any the whale like all thing that are mighty wear a false brow to the common world if you unload his skull of it spermy heap and then take a rear view of it rear end which is the high end you will be struck by it resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of men s skull and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depression on one part of it summit in phrenological phrase you would say this man had no self esteem and no veneration and by those negation considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimension of the whale s proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you if you attentively regard almost any quadruped s spine you will be struck with the resemblance of it vertebr to a strung necklace of dwarfed skull all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebr are absolutely undeveloped skull but the curious external resemblance i take it the german were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebr of which he wa inlaying in a sort of basso relievo the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologist have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigation from the cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a man s character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine a in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck vertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inch across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards a it pass through the remaining vertebr the canal taper in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance the spinal cord a the brain and directly communicates with the brain and what is still more for many foot after emerging from the brain s cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain under all these circumstance would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale s spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate a it may with the phrenologist i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm whale s hump this august hump if i mistake not rise over one of the larger vertebr and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from it relative situation then i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know chapter the pequod meet the virgin the predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and german are now among the least but here and there at very wide interval of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respect while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain wa impelled towards u impatiently standing in the bow instead of the stern what ha he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something wavingly held by the german impossible a lamp feeder not that said stubb no no it s a coffee pot mr starbuck he s coming off to make u our coffee is the yarman don t you see that big tin can there alongside of him that s his boiling water oh he s all right is the yarman go along with you cried flask it s a lamp feeder and an oil can he s out of oil and ha come a begging however curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowing oil on the whale ground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coal to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp feeder a flask did declare a he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lamp feeder and oil can with some remark touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness his last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flying fish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship wa indeed what in the fishery is technically called a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin his necessity supplied derick departed but he had not gained his ship s side when whale were almost simultaneously raised from the mast head of both vessel and so eager for the chase wa derick that without pausing to put his oil can and lamp feeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp feeder now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boat that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequod s keel there were eight whale an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flank a closely a so many span of horse in harness they left a great wide wake a though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many fathom in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress a well a by the unusual yellowish incrustation overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathan to be at all social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the white bone or swell at his broad muzzle wa a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile current meet his spout wa short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shred followed by strange subterranean commotion in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the water behind him to upbubble who s got some paregoric said stubb he ha the stomach ache i m afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomach ache adverse wind are holding mad christmas in him boy it s the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be he s lost his tiller a an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horse careen buries roll and wallow on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib end expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say only wait a bit old chap and i ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whale line near him mind he don t sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the german will have him with one intent all the combined rival boat were pointed for this one fish because not only wa he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he wa nearest to them and the other whale were going with such great velocity moreover a almost to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the pequod s keel had shot by the three german boat last lowered but from the great start he had had derick s boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rival the only thing they feared wa that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pas him a for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp feeder at the other boat the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mock and dare me with the very poor box i filled for him not five minute ago then in his old intense whisper give way greyhound dog to it i tell ye what it is men cried stubb to his crew it s against my religion to get mad but i d like to eat that villainous yarman pull won t ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why don t some of ye burst a blood vessel who s that been dropping an anchor overboard we don t budge an inch we re becalmed halloo here s grass growing in the boat s bottom and by the lord the mast there s budding this won t do boy look at that yarman the short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not oh see the suds he make cried flask dancing up and down what a hump oh do pile on the beef lay like a log oh my lad do spring slap jack and quahog for supper you know my lad baked clam and muffin oh do do spring he s a hundred barreller don t lose him now don t oh don t see that yarman oh won t ye pull for your duff my lad such a sog such a sogger don t ye love sperm there go three thousand dollar men a bank a whole bank the bank of england oh do do do what s that yarman about now at this moment derick wa in the act of pitching his lamp feeder at the advancing boat and also his oil can perhaps with the double view of retarding his rival way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty thousand line of battle ship load of red haired devil what d ye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in two and twenty piece for the honor of old gayhead what d ye say i say pull like god dam cried the indian fiercely but evenly incited by the taunt of the german the pequod s three boat now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mate stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of there she slide now hurrah for the white ash breeze down with the yarman sail over him but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber wa striving to free his white ash and while in consequence derick s boat wa nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage that wa a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forward and slantingly ranged up on the german s quarter an instant more and all four boat were diagonically in the whale s immediate wake while stretching from them on both side wa the foaming swell that he made it wa a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale wa now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circle in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawk but the bird ha a voice and with plaintive cry will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea wa chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there wa enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moment more would give the pequod s boat the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tiger queequeg tashtego daggoo instinctively sprang to their foot and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barb and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket iron entered the whale blinding vapor of foam and white fire the three boat in the first fury of the whale s headlong rush bumped the german s aside with such force that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keel don t be afraid my butter box cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them a he shot by ye ll be picked up presently all right i saw some shark astern st bernard s dog you know relieve distressed traveller hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrah here we go like three tin kettle at the tail of a mad cougar this put me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain make the wheel spoke fly boy when you fasten to him that way and there s danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feel when he s going to davy jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carry the everlasting mail but the monster s run wa a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three line flew round the loggerhead with such a force a to gouge deep groove in them while so fearful were the harpooneer that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the line that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turn with the rope to hold on till at last owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead lined chock of the boat whence the three rope went straight down into the blue the gunwale of the bow were almost even with the water while the three stern tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position wa a little ticklish but though boat have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on a it is called this hooking up by the sharp barb of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torment the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foe yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stay under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whale something less than square foot the pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here above ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathom of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmosphere one whaleman ha estimated it at the weight of twenty line of battle ship with all their gun and store and men on board a the three boat lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into it eternal blue noon and a not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much a a ripple or a bubble came up from it depth what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the sea wa writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inch of perpendicular rope were visible at the bow seems it credible that by three such thin thread the great leviathan wa suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bit of board is this the creature of whom it wa once so triumphantly said canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron or his head with fish spear the sword of him that layeth at him can not hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron a straw the arrow can not make him flee dart are counted a stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophet for with the strength of a thousand thigh in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountain of the sea to hide him from the pequod s fish spear in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadow that the three boat sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantom flitting over his head stand by men he stir cried starbuck a the three line suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them a by magnetic wire the life and death throb of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bow the boat gave a sudden bounce upwards a a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bear are scared from it into the sea haul in haul in cried starbuck again he s rising the line of which hardly an instant before not one hand s breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coil flung back all dripping into the boat and soon the whale broke water within two ship s length of the hunter his motion plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animal there are certain valve or flood gate in many of their vein whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain direction not so with the whale one of whose peculiarity it is to have an entire non valvular structure of the blood vessel so that when pierced even by so small a point a a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant stream yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous it interior fountain that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even a in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the well spring of far off and undiscernible hill even now when the boat pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying fluke and the lance were darted into him they were followed by steady jet from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spout hole in his head wa only at interval however rapid sending it affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life a they significantly call it wa untouched a the boat now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged wa plainly revealed his eye or rather the place where his eye had been were beheld a strange misgrown mass gather in the knot hole of the noblest oak when prostrate so from the point which the whale s eye had once occupied now protruded blind bulb horribly pitiable to see but pity there wa none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eye he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridal and other merry making of men and also to illuminate the solemn church that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once avast cried starbuck there s no need of that but humane starbuck wa too late at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crew all over with shower of gore capsizing flask s boat and marring the bow it wa his death stroke for by this time so spent wa he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secret of his belly lay like a log and died it wa most piteous that last expiring spout a when by unseen hand the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with half stifled melancholy gurglings the spray column lower and lower to the ground so the last long dying spout of the whale soon while the crew were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptom of sinking with all it treasure unrifled immediately by starbuck s order line were secured to it at different point so that ere long every boat wa a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inch beneath them by the cord by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale wa transferred to her side and wa strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke chain for it wa plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon wa found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but a the stump of harpoon are frequently found in the dead body of captured whale with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must need have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious wa the fact of a lance head of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before america wa discovered what other marvel might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop wa put to further discovery by the ship s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the body s immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of affair hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arm with the body then when the command wa given to break clear from it such wa the immovable strain upon the timber head to which the fluke chain and cable were fastened that it wa impossible to cast them off meantime everything in the pequod wa aslant to cross to the other side of the deck wa like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwark and cabin were started from their place by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspike and crow were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke chain to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged end could not be at all approached while every moment whole ton of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over hold on hold on won t ye cried stubb to the body don t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspike and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cut the big chain knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter s heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest fluke chain but a few stroke full of spark were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing nor ha any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale float with great buoyancy with it side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the only whale that thus sank were old meagre and broken hearted creature their pad of lard diminished and all their bone heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whale in the highest health and swelling with noble aspiration prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant hero do sometimes sink be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other specie where one of that sort go down twenty right whale do this difference in the specie is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blind alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instance where after the lapse of many hour or several day the sunken whale again rise more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gas are generated in him he swell to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a line of battle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on sounding among the bay of new zealand when a right whale give token of sinking they fasten buoy to him with plenty of rope so that when the body ha gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again it wa not long after the sinking of the body that a cry wa heard from the pequod s mast head announcing that the jungfrau wa again lowering her boat though the only spout in sight wa that of a fin back belonging to the specie of uncapturable whale because of it incredible power of swimming nevertheless the fin back s spout is so similar to the sperm whale s that by unskilful fisherman it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keel and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase oh many are the fin back and many are the dericks my friend chapter the honor and glory of whaling there are some enterprise in which a careful disorderliness is the true method the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my research up to the very spring head of it so much the more am i impressed with it great honorableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many great demi god and hero prophet of all sort who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity the gallant perseus a son of jupiter wa the first whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood wa not killed with any sordid intent those were the knightly day of our profession when we only bore arm to succor the distressed and not to fill men s lamp feeder every one know the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king wa tied to a rock on the sea coast and a leviathan wa in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid it wa an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneer of the present day inasmuch a this leviathan wa slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temple there stood for many age the vast skeleton of a whale which the city s legend and all the inhabitant asserted to be the identical bone of the monster that perseus slew when the roman took joppa the same skeleton wa carried to italy in triumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it wa from joppa that jonah set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it is that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicle whale and dragon are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other thou art a a lion of the water and a a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some version of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale let not the modern painting of this scene mislead u for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin like shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those time when the true form of the whale wa unknown to artist and considering that a in perseus case st george s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or sea horse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draught of the scene to hold this so called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistine dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horse s head and both the palm of his hand fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good right we harpooneer of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knight of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frock and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st george s decoration than they whether to admit hercules among u or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythology that antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoicing good deed wa swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly make a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan but by the best contradictory authority this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice vers certainly they are very similar if i claim the demi god then why not the prophet nor do hero saint demigod and prophet alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal king of old time we find the head water of our fraternity in nothing short of the great god themselves that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which give u the dread vishnoo one of the three person in the godhead of the hindoo give u this divine vishnoo himself for our lord vishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnation ha for ever set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of god saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of it periodical dissolution he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the veda or mystical book whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hint to young architect these veda were lying at the bottom of the water so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depth rescued the sacred volume wa not this vishnoo a whaleman then even a a man who ride a horse is called a horseman perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo there s a member roll for you what club but the whaleman s can head off like that chapter jonah historically regarded reference wa made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greek and roman who standing out from the orthodox pagan of their time equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those tradition did not make those tradition one whit the less fact for all that one old sag harbor whaleman s chief reason for questioning the hebrew story wa this he had one of those quaint old fashioned bible embellished with curious unscientific plate one of which represented jonah s whale with two spout in his head a peculiarity only true with respect to a specie of the leviathan the right whale and the variety of that order concerning which the fisherman have this saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small but to this bishop jebb s anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hint the bishop that we consider jonah a tombed in the whale s belly but a temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whale s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist table and comfortably seat all the player possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thought the right whale is toothless another reason which sag harbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet wa something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale s gastric juice but this objection likewise fall to the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale even a the french soldier in the russian campaign turned their dead horse into tent and crawled into them besides it ha been divined by other continental commentator that when jonah wa thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figure head and i would add possibly called the whale a some craft are nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life preserver an inflated bag of wind which the endangered prophet swam to and so wa saved from a watery doom poor sag harbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for his want of faith it wa this if i remember right jonah wa swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three day he wa vomited up somewhere within three day journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three day journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that but wa there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three day not to speak of the tigris water near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in besides this idea of jonah s weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz it reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar but all these foolish argument of old sag harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea i say it only show his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah s going to nineveh via the cape of good hope wa advanced a a signal magnification of the general miracle and so it wa besides to this day the highly enlightened turk devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three century ago an english traveller in old harris s voyage speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in which mosque wa a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil chapter pitchpoling to make them run easily and swiftly the axle of carriage are anointed and for much the same purpose some whaler perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that a such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pain in that occupation crawling under it bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness a though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft s bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event towards noon whale were raised but so soon a the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight a of cleopatra s barge from actium nevertheless the boat pursued and stubb s wa foremost by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted straining upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boat up to his flank wa impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained of all the wondrous device and dexterity the sleight of hand and countless subtlety to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine man uvre with the lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all it exercise boast nothing like it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale it grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve foot in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter material pine it is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon a compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawback a a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling come into play look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergency wa specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling look at him he stand upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty foot ahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along it length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gather up the coil of the warp in one hand so a to secure it free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before his waistband s middle he level it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the butt end in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stand fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen foot in the air he mind you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel span the foaming distance and quiver in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spout red blood that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb ti july s immortal fourth all fountain must run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then tashtego lad i d have ye hold a canakin to the jet and we d drink round it yea verily heart alive we d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the living stuff again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to it master like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale go into his flurry the tow line is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern fold his hand and mutely watch the monster die chapter the fountain that for six thousand year and no one know how many million of age before the great whale should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mistifying the garden of the deep a with so many sprinkling or mistifying pot and that for some century back thousand of hunter should have been close by the fountain of the whale watching these sprinkling and spoutings that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minute past one o clock p m of this sixteenth day of december a d it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vapor this is surely a noteworthy thing let u then look at this matter along with some interesting item contingent every one know that by the peculiar cunning of their gill the finny tribe in general breathe the air which at all time is combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise it head above the surface but owing to his marked internal structure which give him regular lung like a human being s the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visit to the upper world but he can not in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm whale s mouth is buried at least eight foot beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe ha no connexion with his mouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head if i say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch a it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood it vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific word assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostril and not fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then live without breathing anomalous a it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically life by interval his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much a in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he ha no gill how is this between his rib and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli like vessel which vessel when he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand fathom in the sea he carry a surplus stock of vitality in him just a the camel crossing the waterless desert carry a surplus supply of drink for future use in it four supplementary stomach the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out a the fisherman phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested rising say he stay eleven minute and jet seventy time that is respires seventy breath then whenever he rise again he will be sure to have his seventy breath over again to a minute now if after he fetch a few breath you alarm him so that he sound he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breath are told will he finally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that in different individual these rate are different but in any one they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the whale s rising expose him to all the fatal hazard of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathom beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter a the great necessity that strike the victory to thee in man breathing is incessantly going on one breath only serving for two or three pulsation so that whatever other business he ha to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time it ha been said that the whale only breathes through his spout hole if it could truthfully be added that his spout are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answer to his nose is that identical spout hole and being so clogged with two element it could not be expected to have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the spout whether it be water or whether it be vapor no absolute certainty can a yet be arrived at on this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale ha no proper olfactories but what doe he want of them no rose no violet no cologne water in the sea furthermore a his windpipe solely open into the tube of his spouting canal and a that long canal like the grand erie canal is furnished with a sort of lock that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale ha no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumble he talk through his nose but then again what ha the whale to say seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended a it is for the conveyance of air and for several foot laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gas pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street but the question return whether this gas pipe is also a water pipe in other word whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it can not be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally take in water but the sperm whale s food is far beneath the surface and there he can not spout even if he would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the period of his jet and the ordinary period of respiration but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain thing i have ever found your plain thing the knottiest of all and a for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided a to what it is precisely the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water fall from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such time you should think that you really perceived drop of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from it vapor or how do you know that they are not those identical drop superficially lodged in the spout hole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whale s head for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid day sea in a calm with his elevated hump sun dried a a dromedary s in the desert even then the whale always carry a small basin of water on his head a under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it you can not go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapory shred of the jet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise i can not say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eye it will blind you the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even if we can not prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reason to this conclusion i am impelled by consideration touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch a it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on sounding or near shore all other whale sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from the head of all ponderous profound being such a plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always go up a certain semi visible steam while in the act of thinking deep thought while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cup of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition and how nobly it raise our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplation and that vapor a you will sometimes see it glorified by a rainbow a if heaven itself had put it seal upon his thought for d ye see rainbow do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapor and so through all the thick mist of the dim doubt in my mind divine intuition now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubt many deny but doubt or denial few along with them have intuition doubt of all thing earthly and intuition of some thing heavenly this combination make neither believer nor infidel but make a man who regard them both with equal eye chapter the tail other poet have warbled the praise of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i celebrate a tail reckoning the largest sized sperm whale s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it taper to about the girth of a man it comprises upon it upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square foot the compact round body of it root expands into two broad firm flat palm or fluke gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junction these fluke slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wing leaving a wide vacancy between in no living thing are the line of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic border of these fluke at it utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty foot across the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinew but cut into it and you find that three distinct stratum compose it upper middle and lower the fibre in the upper and lower layer are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layer this triune structure a much a anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman wall the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tile always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relic of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry but a if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibre and filament which passing on either side the loin and running down into the fluke insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it nor doe this it amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of it motion where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power on the contrary those motion derive their most appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength ha much to do with the magic take away the tied tendon that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and it charm would be gone a devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe he wa overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed a a roman triumphal arch when angelo paint even god the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian picture in which his idea ha been most successfully embodied these picture so destitute a they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hand it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtue of his teaching such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in it flexion are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no fairy s arm can transcend it five great motion are peculiar to it first when used a a fin for progression second when used a a mace in battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking fluke first being horizontal in it position the leviathan s tail act in a different manner from the tail of all other sea creature it never wriggle in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail is the sole mean of propulsion scroll wise coiled forward beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which give that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his side fin only serve to steer by second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fight another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflict with man he chiefly and contemptuously us his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curve away his fluke from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend to it mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no rib of man or boat can withstand it your only salvation lie in eluding it but if it come sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of it material a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result these submerged side blow are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere child s play some one strip off a frock and the hole is stopped third i can not demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant s trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness move his immense fluke from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailor s whisker woe to that sailor whisker and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flower market and with low salutation presented nosegay to damsel and then caressed their zone on more account than one a pity it is that the whale doe not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary sea you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kitten like he play on the ocean a if it were a hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palm of his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for mile you would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that wa the smoke from the touch hole fifth a in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the fluke lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deep his entire fluke with at least thirty foot of his body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breach somewhere else to be described this peaking of the whale s fluke is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundity the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven so in dream have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in gazing at such scene it is all in all what mood you are in if in the dantean the devil will occur to you if in that of isaiah the archangel standing at the mast head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whale in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked fluke a it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the god wa never beheld even in persia the home of the fire worshipper a ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all being for according to king juba the military elephant of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunk uplifted in the profoundest silence the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far a some aspect of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organ on an equality much less the creature to which they respectively belong for a the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared with leviathan s tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephant s trunk were a the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale s ponderous fluke which in repeated instance have one after the other hurled entire boat with all their oar and crew into the air very much a an indian juggler toss his ball though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch a in that particular the elephant stand in much the same respect to the whale that a dog doe to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some point of curious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability to express it at time there are gesture in it which though they would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gesture that i have heard hunter who have declared them akin to free mason sign and symbol that the whale indeed by these method intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other motion of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he ha none thou shalt see my back part my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i can not completely make out his back part and hint what he will about his face i say again he ha no face chapter the grand armada the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending south eastward from the territory of birmah form the most southerly point of all asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long island of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelago this rampart is pierced by several sally port for the convenience of ship and whale conspicuous among which are the strait of sunda and malacca by the strait of sunda chiefly vessel bound to china from the west emerge into the china sea those narrow strait of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing midway in that vast rampart of island buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seaman a java head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spice and silk and jewel and gold and ivory with which the thousand island of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such treasure by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the all grasping western world the shore of the strait of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortress which guard the entrance to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the dane these oriental do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top sail from the endless procession of ship before the wind which for century past by night and by day have passed between the island of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargo of the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no mean renounce their claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas of the malay lurking among the low shaded cove and islet of sumatra have sallied out upon the vessel sailing through the strait fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spear though by the repeated bloody chastisement they have received at the hand of european cruiser the audacity of these corsair ha of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessel which in those water have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair fresh wind the pequod wa now drawing nigh to these strait ahab purposing to pas through them into the javan sea and thence cruising northward over water known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine island and gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there by these mean the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising ground of the world previous to descending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he wa most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it but how now in this zoned quest doe ahab touch no land doe his crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now the circus running sun ha raced within his fiery ring and need no sustenance but what s in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while other hull are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferred to foreign wharf the world wandering whale ship carry no cargo but herself and crew their weapon and their want she ha a whole lake s content bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with utility not altogether with unusable pig lead and kentledge she carry year water in her clear old prime nantucket water which when three year afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in cask from the peruvian or indian stream hence it is that while other ship may have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score of port the whale ship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seaman like themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answer well boy here s the ark now a many sperm whale had been captured off the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the strait of sunda indeed a most of the ground roundabout wa generally recognised by the fisherman a an excellent spot for cruising therefore a the pequod gained more and more upon java head the look out were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliff of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostril the fresh cinnamon wa snuffed in the air yet not a single jet wa descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the strait when the customary cheering cry wa heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted u but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four ocean the sperm whale instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached company a in former time are now frequently met with in extensive herd sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem a if numerous nation of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravan may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising ground you may now sometimes sail for week and month together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousand on thousand broad on both bow at the distance of some two or three mile and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whale jet were up playing and sparkling in the noon day air unlike the straight perpendicular twin jet of the right whale which dividing at top fall over in two branch like the cleft drooping bough of a willow the single forward slanting spout of the sperm whale present a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward seen from the pequod s deck then a she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapory spout individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimney of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height a marching army approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountain accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whale now seem hurrying forward through the strait gradually contracting the wing of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneer handling their weapon and loudly cheering from the head of their yet suspended boat if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these strait of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental sea to witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped white elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with stun sail piled on stun sail we sailed along driving these leviathan before u when of a sudden the voice of tashtego wa heard loudly directing attention to something in our wake corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of detached white vapor rising and falling something like the spout of the whale only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivot hole cry aloft there and rig whip and bucket to wet the sail malay sir and after u a if too long lurking behind the headland till the pequod should fairly have entered the strait these rascally asiatic were now in hot pursuit to make up for their over cautious delay but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind wa herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropist to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit mere riding whip and rowel to her that they were a with glass under arm ahab to and fro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monster he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirate chasing him some such fancy a the above seemed his and when he glanced upon the green wall of the watery defile in which the ship wa then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same gate he wa now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirate and inhuman atheistical devil were infernally cheering him on with their curse when all these conceit had passed through his brain ahab s brow wa left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide ha been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from it place but thought like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirate astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad water beyond then the harpooneer seemed more to grieve that the swift whale had been gaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malay but still driving on in the wake of the whale at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word wa passed to spring to the boat but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notified of the three keel that were after them though a yet a mile in their rear than they rallied again and forming in close rank and battalion so that their spout all looked like flashing line of stacked bayonet moved on with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirt and drawer we sprang to the white ash and after several hour pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing commotion among the whale gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fisherman perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial column in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephant in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation in all direction expanding in vast irregular circle and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this wa still more strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed a it were helplessly floated like water logged dismantled ship on the sea had these leviathan been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolf they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creature though banding together in ten of thousand the lion maned buffalo of the west have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human being how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre s pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helter skelter for the outlet crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whale before u for there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men though many of the whale a ha been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that a a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place a is customary in those case the boat at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirt of the shoal in about three minute time queequeg s harpoon wa flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our face and then running away with u like light steered straight for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstance is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet doe it present one of the more perilous vicissitude of the fishery for a the swift monster drag you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb a blind and deaf the whale plunged forward a if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him a we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all side menaced a we flew by the crazed creature to and fro rushing about u our beset boat wa like a ship mobbed by ice isle in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channel and strait knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed but not a bit daunted queequeg steered u manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal fluke were suspended overhead while all the time starbuck stood up in the bow lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whale he could reach by short dart for there wa no time to make long one nor were the oarsman quite idle though their wonted duty wa now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp u hard down with your tail there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan like extremity all whaleboat carry certain curious contrivance originally invented by the nantucket indian called druggs two thick square of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each other s grain at right angle a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly among gallied whale that this drugg is used for then more whale are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm whale are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and if you can not kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at time like these the drugg come into requisition our boat wa furnished with three of them the first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whale staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like malefactor with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seat of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boat s bottom a the seat slid from under him on both side the sea came in at the wounded plank but we stuffed two or three drawer and shirt in and so stopped the leak for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged harpoon were it not that a we advanced into the herd our whale s way greatly diminished moreover that a we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorder seemed waning so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whale into the innermost heart of the shoal a if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storm in the roaring glen between the outermost whale were heard but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin like surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet mood yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumult of the outer concentric circle and saw successive pod of whale eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied span of horse in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circus rider might easily have over arched the middle one and so have gone round on their back owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whale more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape wa at present afforded u we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed u in the wall that had only admitted u in order to shut u up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cow and calf the woman and child of this routed host now inclusive of the occasional wide interval between the revolving outer circle and inclusive of the space between the various pod in any one of those circle the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square mile at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this circumstance because a if the cow and calf had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and a if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of it stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whale now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which it wa impossible not to marvel at like household dog they came snuffling round u right up to our gunwale and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their forehead starbuck scratched their back with his lance but fearful of the consequence for the time refrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eye a we gazed over the side for suspended in those watery vault floated the form of the nursing mother of the whale and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mother the lake a i have hinted wa to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and a human infant while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast a if leading two different life at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence even so did the young of these whale seem looking up towards u but not at u a if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new born sight floating on their side the mother also seemed quietly eyeing u one of these little infant that from certain queer token seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen foot in length and some six foot in girth he wa a little frisky though a yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lie bent like a tartar s bow the delicate side fin and the palm of his fluke still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby s ear newly arrived from foreign part line line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him fast who line him who struck two whale one big one little what ail ye man cried starbuck look e here said queequeg pointing down a when the stricken whale that from the tub ha reeled out hundred of fathom of rope a after deep sounding he float up again and show the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now starbuck saw long coil of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to it dam not seldom in the rapid vicissitude of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secret of the sea seemed divulged to u in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan amour in the deep the sperm whale a with all other specie of the leviathan but unlike most other fish breed indifferently at all season after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine month producing but one at a time though in some few known instance giving birth to an esau and jacob a contingency provided for in suckling by two teat curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the breast themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious part in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter s lance the mother s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rod the milk is very sweet and rich it ha been tasted by man it might do well with strawberry when overflowing with mutual esteem the whale salute more hominum and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternation and affright did these inscrutable creature at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planet of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy meanwhile a we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacle in the distance evinced the activity of the other boat still engaged in drugging the whale on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreat were afforded them but the sight of the enraged drugged whale now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circle wa nothing to what at last met our eye it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him a it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail tendon it is done by darting a short handled cutting spade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again a whale wounded a we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually a it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he wa now dashing among the revolving circle like the lone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went but agonizing a wa the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd wa owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from u but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accident of the fishery this whale had become entangled in the harpoon line that he towed he had also run away with the cutting spade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coil of the harpoon line round his tail the cutting spade itself had worked loose from his flesh so that tormented to madness he wa now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrade this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright first the whale forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other a if lifted by half spent billow from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridal chamber and nursery vanished in more and more contracting orbit the whale in the more central circle began to swim in thickening cluster yes the long calm wa departing a low advancing hum wa soon heard and then like to the tumultuous mass of block ice when the great river hudson break up in spring the entire host of whale came tumbling upon their inner centre a if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck and queequeg changed place starbuck taking the stern oar oar he intensely whispered seizing the helm gripe your oar and clutch your soul now my god men stand by shove him off you queequeg the whale there prick him hit him stand up stand up and stay so spring men pull men never mind their back scrape them scrape away the boat wa now all but jammed between two vast black bulk leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long length but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hair breadth escape we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circle but now crossed by random whale all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation wa cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg s hat who while standing in the bow to prick the fugitive whale had his hat taken clean from his head by the air eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad fluke close by riotous and disordered a the universal commotion now wa it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit wa useless but the boat still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whale might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark it place on the sea and also a token of prior possession should the boat of any other ship draw near the result of this lowering wa somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fishery the more whale the less fish of all the drugged whale only one wa captured the rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken a will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the pequod chapter school and schoolmaster the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whale and there wa also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregation now though such great body are at time encountered yet a must have been seen even at the present day small detached band are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individual each such band are known a school they generally are of two sort those composed almost entirely of female and those mustering none but young vigorous male or bull a they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school of female you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his lady in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solace and endearment of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and his concubine is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportion the lady even at full growth are not more than one third of the bulk of an average sized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen yard round the waist nevertheless it can not be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point it is very curious to watch this harem and it lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern sea and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental water in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year when serenely advancing on one of these journey if any strange suspicious sight are seen my lord whale keep a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the lady with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chase him away high time indeed if unprincipled young rake like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he can not keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for ala all fish bed in common a ashore the lady often cause the most terrible duel among their rival admirer just so with the whale who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with their long lower jaw sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elk that warringly interweave their antler not a few are captured having the deep scar of these encounter furrowed head broken teeth scolloped fin and in some instance wrenched and dislocated mouth but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem s lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revel there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubine granting other whale to be in sight the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these grand turk for these grand turk are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small a for the son and the daughter they beget why those son and daughter must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lover that might be named my lord whale ha no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaf his anonymous baby all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless a the ardour of youth decline a year and dump increase a reflection lends her solemn pause in short a a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maiden our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul go about all alone among the meridian and parallel saying his prayer and warning each young leviathan from his amorous error now a the harem of whale is called by the fisherman a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known a the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoir of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a country schoolmaster that famous frenchman wa in his younger day and what wa the nature of those occult lesson he inculcated into some of his pupil the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing year is true of all aged sperm whale almost universally a lone whale a a solitary leviathan is called prof an ancient one like venerable moss bearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he take to wife in the wilderness of water and the best of wife she is though she keep so many moody secret the school composing none but young and vigorous male previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem school for while those female whale are characteristically timid the young male or forty barrel bull a they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathan and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous grey headed grizzled whale sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiend exasperated by a penal gout the forty barrel bull school are larger than the harem school like a mob of young collegian they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about three fourth grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlement that is harem another point of difference between the male and female school is still more characteristic of the sex say you strike a forty barrel bull poor devil all his comrade quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companion swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long a themselves to fall a prey chapter fast fish and loose fish the allusion to the waif and waif pole in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the law and regulation of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge it frequently happens that when several ship are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingency all partaking of this one grand feature for example after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tow it alongside without risk of life or line thus the most vexatious and violent dispute would often arise between the fisherman were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all case perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment wa that of holland it wa decreed by the state general in a d but though no other nation ha ever had any written whaling law yet the american fisherman have been their own legislator and lawyer in this matter they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian s pandects and the by law of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people s business yes these law might be engraven on a queen anne s farthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they i a fast fish belongs to the party fast to it ii a loose fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it but what play the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentary to expound it first what is a fast fish alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupant a mast an oar a nine inch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same likewise a fish is technically fast when it bear a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long a the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside a well a their intention so to do these are scientific commentary but the commentary of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard word and harder knock the coke upon littleton of the fist true among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowance are always made for peculiar case where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others are by no mean so scrupulous some fifty year ago there wa a curious case of whale trover litigated in england wherein the plaintiff set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern sea and when indeed they the plaintiff had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their life obliged to forsake not only their line but their boat itself ultimately the defendant the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eye of the plaintiff and when those defendant were remonstrated with their captain snapped his finger in the plaintiff teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoon and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the plaintiff now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoon and boat mr erskine wa counsel for the defendant lord ellenborough wa the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wife s viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the sea of life but in the course of year repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her erskine wa on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loose fish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re harpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentleman s property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case erskine contended that the example of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other these pleading and the counter pleading being duly heard the very learned judge in set term decided to wit that a for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiff because they had merely abandoned it to save their life but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoon and line they belonged to the defendant the whale because it wa a loose fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoon and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish acquired a property in those article and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them now the defendant afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid article were theirs a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principle laid down in the twin whaling law previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two law touching fast fish and loose fish i say will on reflection be found the fundamental of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding it complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistine ha but two prop to stand on is it not a saying in every one s mouth possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the sinew and soul of russian serf and republican slave but fast fish whereof possession is the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widow s last mite but a fast fish what is yonder undetected villain s marble mansion with a door plate for a waif what is that but a fast fish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker get from poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone s family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fast fish what is the archbishop of savesoul s income of seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundred of thousand of broken backed laborer all sure of heaven without any of savesoul s help what is that globular but a fast fish what are the duke of dunder s hereditary town and hamlet but fast fish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fast fish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fast fish and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law but if the doctrine of fast fish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of loose fish is still more widely so that is internationally and universally applicable what wa america in but a loose fish in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress what wa poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india to england what at last will mexico be to the united state all loose fish what are the right of man and the liberty of the world but loose fish what all men s mind and opinion but loose fish what is the principle of religious belief in them but a loose fish what to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thought of thinker but loose fish what is the great globe itself but a loose fish and what are you reader but a loose fish and a fast fish too chapter head or tail de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam bracton l c latin from the book of the law of england which taken along with the context mean that of all whale captured by anybody on the coast of that land the king a honorary grand harpooneer must have the head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder now a this law under a modified form is to this day in force in england and a it offer in various respect a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose fish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompt the english railway to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in curious proof of the fact that the above mentioned law is still in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two year it seems that some honest mariner of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque port had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore now the cinque port are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden holding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal emolument incident to the cinque port territory become by assignment his by some writer this office is called a sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at time in fobbing his perquisite which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them now when these poor sun burnt mariner bare footed and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely leg had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry promising themselves a good from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wife and good ale with their crony upon the strength of their respective share up step a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whale s head he say hand off this fish my master is a fast fish i seize it a the lord warden s upon this the poor mariner in their respectful consternation so truly english knowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their head all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for his idea made bold to speak please sir who is the lord warden the duke but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish it is his we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the duke s benefit we getting nothing at all for our pain but our blister it is his is the duke so very poor a to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood it is his i thought to relieve my old bed ridden mother by part of my share of this whale it is his won t the duke be content with a quarter or a half it is his in a word the whale wa seized and sold and his grace the duke of wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular light the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstance a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariner into full consideration to which my lord duke in substance replied both letter were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other people s business is this the still militant old man standing at the corner of the three kingdom on all hand coercing alms of beggar it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale wa a delegated one from the sovereign we must need inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right the law itself ha already been set forth but plowdon give u the reason for it say plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen because of it superior excellence and by the soundest commentator this ha ever been held a cogent argument in such matter but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason for that ye lawyer in his treatise on queen gold or queen pinmoney an old king s bench author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queen s that ye queen s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this wa written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale wa largely used in lady bodice but this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writer the whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitation and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown s ordinary revenue i know not that any other author ha hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way a the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all thing even in law chapter the pequod meet the rose bud in vain it wa to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry sir t browne v e it wa a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory mid day sea that the many nose on the pequod s deck proved more vigilant discoverer than the three pair of eye aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell wa smelt in the sea i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whale we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long presently the vapor in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sail betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside a we glided nearer the stranger showed french colour from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea fowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it wa plain that the whale alongside must be what the fisherman call a blasted whale that is a whale that ha died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subject is of a very inferior quality and by no mean of the nature of attar of rose coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whale that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct body almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale a this however much he may shun blasted whale in general the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade pole entangled in the line that were knotted round the tail of one of these whale there s a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ship s bow there s a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchman are but poor devil in the fishery sometimes lowering their boat for breaker mistaking them for sperm whale spout yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of box of tallow candle and case of snuffer foreseeing that all the oil they will get won t be enough to dip the captain s wick into aye we all know these thing but look ye here s a crappo that is content with our leaving the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bone of that other precious fish he ha there poor devil i say pas round a hat some one and let s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity s sake for what oil he ll get from that drugged whale there wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and a for the other whale why i ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three mast of ours than he ll get from that bundle of bone though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man ha thought of that it s worth trying yes i m for it and so saying he started for the quarter deck by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod wa now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by it breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boat s crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stem piece wa carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk wa painted green and for thorn had copper spike projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head board in large gilt letter he read bouton de rose rose button or rose bud and this wa the romantic name of this aromatic ship though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet the word rose and the bulbous figure head put together sufficiently explained the whole to him a wooden rose bud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smell now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bow to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawled bouton de rose ahoy are there any of you bouton de rose that speak english yes rejoined a guernsey man from the bulwark who turned out to be the chief mate well then my bouton de rose bud have you seen the white whale what whale the white whale a sperm whale moby dick have ye seen him never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale no very good then good bye now and i ll call again in a minute then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter deck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hand into a trumpet and shouted no sir no upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernsey man who had just got into the chain and wa using a cutting spade had slung his nose in a sort of bag what s the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it i wish it wa broken or that i didn t have any nose at all answered the guernsey man who did not seem to relish the job he wa at very much but what are you holding yours for oh nothing it s a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day ain t it air rather gardenny i should say throw u a bunch of posy will ye bouton de rose what in the devil s name do you want here roared the guernseyman flying into a sudden passion oh keep cool cool yes that s the word why don t you pack those whale in ice while you re working at em but joking aside though do you know rose bud that it s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whale a for that dried up one there he hasn t a gill in his whole carcase i know that well enough but d ye see the captain here won t believe it this is his first voyage he wa a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap he ll believe you if he won t me and so i ll get out of this dirty scrape anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the sailor in tasselled cap of red worsted were getting the heavy tackle in readiness for the whale but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their nose upwardly projected from their face like so many jib boom now and then pair of them would drop their work and run up to the mast head to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coal tar and at interval held it to their nostril others having broken the stem of their pipe almost short off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobacco smoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories stubb wa struck by a shower of outcry and anathema proceeding from the captain s round house abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which wa held ajar from within this wa the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceeding of the day had betaken himself to the captain s round house cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaty and indignation at time marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernsey man had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain a a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernsey man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise wa quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernsey man under cover of an interpreter s office wa to tell the captain what he pleased but a coming from stubb and a for stubb he wa to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he wa a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a sea captain with large whisker and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch seal at his side to this gentleman stubb wa now politely introduced by the guernsey man who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them what shall i say to him first said he why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seal you may a well begin by telling him that he look a sort of babyish to me though i don t pretend to be a judge he say monsieur said the guernsey man in french turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chief mate with six sailor had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more what now said the guernsey man to stubb why since he take it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully i m quite certain that he s no more fit to command a whale ship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me he s a baboon he vow and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures u a we value our life to cut loose from these fish instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting tackle and at once cast loose the cable and chain confining the whale to the ship what now said the guernsey man when the captain had returned to them why let me see yes you may a well tell him now that that in fact tell him i ve diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else he say monsieur that he s very happy to have been of any service to u hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful party meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux he want you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter thank him heartily but tell him it s against my principle to drink with the man i ve diddled in fact tell him i must go he say monsieur that his principle won t admit of his drinking but that if monsieur want to live another day to drink then monsieur had best drop all four boat and pull the ship away from these whale for it s so calm they won t drift by this time stubb wa over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernsey man to this effect that having a long tow line in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship s side while the frenchman s boat then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow line presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boat the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubb s whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intention at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boat spade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he wa digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt rib it wa like turning up old roman tile and pottery buried in fat english loam his boat s crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking a anxious a gold hunter and all the time numberless fowl were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb wa beginning to look disappointed especially a the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smell without being absorbed by it a one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean region a purse a purse dropping his spade he thrust both hand in and drew out handful of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good friend is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handful were obtained but more wa unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab s loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye chapter ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important a an article of commerce that in a certain nantucket born captain coffin wa examined at the bar of the english house of common on that subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substance are quite distinct for amber though at time found on the sea coast is also dug up in some far inland soil whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth piece to pipe for bead and ornament but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candle hair powder and pomatum the turk use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peter s in rome some wine merchant drop a few grain into claret to flavor it who would think then that such fine lady and gentleman should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowel of a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat load of brandreth s pill and then running out of harm s way a laborer do in blasting rock i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plate which at first stubb thought might be sailor trowsers button but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than piece of small squid bone embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthian about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all thing of ill savor cologne water in it rudimental manufacturing stage is the worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but can not owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased mind might be considered a indirectly substantiated by what ha been said of the frenchman s two whale elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion ha been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that all whale always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ship in london more than two century ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea a the southern ship have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bit thrust it through the bung hole of large cask and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy sea and the sudden and violent storm to which they are exposed forbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemetery in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave yard for the foundation of a lying in hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whaler may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former time of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smell a text book on that subject a it name import smeer fat berg to put up this village wa founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it wa a collection of furnace fat kettle and oil shed and when the work were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four year perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil doe not perhaps consume fifty day in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whale a a specie are by no mean creature of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised a the people of the middle age affected to detect a jew in the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when a a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of door though it is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm whale s fluke above water dispenses a perfume a when a musk scented lady rustle her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusk and redolent with myrrh which wa led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great chapter the castaway it wa but some few day after encountering the frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod s crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own now in the whale ship it is not every one that go in the boat some few hand are reserved called ship keeper whose province it is to work the vessel while the boat are pursuing the whale a a general thing these ship keeper are a hardy fellow a the men comprising the boat crew but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a ship keeper it wa so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick name pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy jolly in outer aspect pip and dough boy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal development though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span but while hapless dough boy wa by nature dull and torpid in his intellect pip though over tender hearted wa at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holiday and festivity with finer freer relish than any other race for black the year s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty five fourth of july and new year s day nor smile so while i write that this little black wa brilliant for even blackness ha it brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in king s cabinet but pip loved life and all life s peaceable security so that the panic striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though a ere long will be seen what wa thus temporarily subdued in him in the end wa destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fire that fictitiously showed him off to ten time the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddler s frolic on the green and at melodious even tide with his gay ha ha had turned the round horizon into one star belled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blue veined neck the pure watered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in it most impressive lustre he lay it against a gloomy ground and then light it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gas then come out those fiery effulgence infernally superb then the evil blazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal sky look like some crown jewel stolen from the king of hell but let u to the story it came to pas that in the ambergris affair stubb s after oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand a for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip wa put into his place the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and a the fish received the darted iron it gave it customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pip s seat the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so a to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chock of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turn around his chest and neck tashtego stood in the bow he wa full of the fire of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boat knife from it sheath he suspended it sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pip s blue choked face plainly looked do for god s sake all passed in a flash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale wa lost and pip wa saved so soon a he recovered himself the poor little negro wa assailed by yell and execration from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain business like but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance wa never jump from a boat pip except but all the rest wa indefinite a the soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your true motto in whaling but case will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better moreover a if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord i won t pick you up if you jump mind that we can t afford to lose whale by the like of you a whale would sell for thirty time what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and don t jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a money making animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hand of the god and pip jumped again it wa under very similar circumstance to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip wa left behind on the sea like a hurried traveller s trunk ala stubb wa but too true to his word it wa a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like gold beater s skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pip s ebon head showed like a head of clove no boat knife wa lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubb s inexorable back wa turned upon him and the whale wa winged in three minute a whole mile of shoreless ocean wa between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is a easy to the practised swimmer a to ride in a spring carriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how when sailor in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her side but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boat in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such consideration towards oarsman jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunter in all similar instance and such instance not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navy and army but it so happened that those boat without seeing pip suddenly spying whale close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubb s boat wa now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that pip s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he wa the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather carried down alive to wondrous depth where strange shape of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eye and the miser merman wisdom revealed his hoarded heap and among the joyous heartless ever juvenile eternity pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insect that out of the firmament of water heaved the colossal orb he saw god s foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmate called him mad so man s insanity is heaven s sense and wandering from all mortal reason man come at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feel then uncompromised indifferent a his god for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself chapter a squeeze of the hand that whale of stubb s so dearly purchased wa duly brought to the pequod s side where all those cutting and hoisting operation previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tub so soon a filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm wa carefully manipulated ere going to the try work of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantine s bath of it i found it strangely concreted into lump here and there rolling about in the liquid part it wa our business to squeeze these lump back into fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old time this sperm wa such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hand in it for only a few minute my finger felt like eel and began a it were to serpentine and spiralise a i sat there at my ease cross legged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along a i bathed my hand among those soft gentle globule of infiltrated tissue woven almost within the hour a they richly broke to my finger and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grape their wine a i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma literally and truly like the smell of spring violet i declare to you that for the time i lived a in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hand and my heart of it i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all ill will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co laborer hand in it mistaking their hand for the gentle globule such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i wa continually squeezing their hand and looking up into their eye sentimentally a much a to say oh my dear fellow being why should we longer cherish any social acerbity or know the slightest ill humor or envy come let u squeeze hand all round nay let u all squeeze ourselves into each other let u squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experience i have perceived that in all case man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thought of the vision of the night i saw long row of angel in paradise each with his hand in a jar of spermaceti now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other thing akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try work first come white horse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portion of his fluke it is tough with congealed tendon a wad of muscle but still contains some oil after being severed from the whale the white horse is first cut into portable oblong ere going to the mincer they look much like block of berkshire marble plum pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary part of the whale s flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in it unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold a it name import it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spot of the deepest crimson and purple it is plum of ruby in picture of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something a i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyard of champagne there is another substance and a very singular one which turn up in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tub of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membrane of the case coalescing gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fisherman it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale and much of which cover the deck of those inferior soul who hunt that ignoble leviathan nipper strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale s vocabulary but a applied by whalemen it becomes so a whaleman s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathan s tail it average an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishment a of magic allure along with it all impurity but to learn all about these recondite matter your best way is at once to descend into the blubber room and have a long talk with it inmate this place ha previously been mentioned a the receptacle for the blanket piece when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up it content this apartment is a scene of terror to all tiro especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space ha been left clear for the workman they generally go in pair a pike and gaffman and a spade man the whaling pike is similar to a frigate s boarding weapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boat hook with his gaff the gaffman hook on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping a the ship pitch and lurch about meanwhile the spade man stand on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse piece this spade is sharp a hone can make it the spademan s foot are shoeless the thing he stand on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cut off one of his own toe or one of his assistant would you be very much astonished toe are scarce among veteran blubber room men chapter the cassock had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this post mortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scupper not the wondrous cistern in the whale s huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you a half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone longer than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet black a yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or rather in old time it likeness wa such an idol a that found in the secret grove of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron a darkly set forth in the th chapter of the first book of king look at the sailor called the mincer who now come along and assisted by two ally heavily back the grandissimus a the mariner call it and with bowed shoulder stagger off with it a if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove it dark pelt a an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turn the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg give it a good stretching so a almost to double it diameter and at last hang it well spread in the rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three foot of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slit for arm hole at the other end he lengthwise slip himself bodily into it the mincer now stand before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar function of his office that office consists in mincing the horse piece of blubber for the pot an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwark and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced piece drop fast a the sheet from a rapt orator s desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaf what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer bible leaf bible leaf this is the invariable cry from the mate to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into a thin slice a possible inasmuch a by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and it quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality chapter the try work besides her hoisted boat an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try work she present the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship it is a if from the open field a brick kiln were transported to her plank the try work are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck the timber beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten foot by eight square and five in height the foundation doe not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knee of iron bracing it on all side and screwing it down to the timber on the flank it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great try pot two in number and each of several barrel capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punch bowl during the night watch some cynical old sailor will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing them one man in each pot side by side many confidential communication are carried on over the iron lip it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation it wa in the left hand try pot of the pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me that i wa first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all body gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time removing the fire board from the front of the try work the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouth of the furnace directly underneath the pot these mouth are fitted with heavy door of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by mean of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the work by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water a fast a it evaporates there are no external chimney they open direct from the rear wall and here let u go back for a moment it wa about nine o clock at night that the pequod s try work were first started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee the business all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the work this wa an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shaving into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try work ha to be fed for a time with wood after that no wood is used except a a mean of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scrap or fritter still contains considerable of it unctuous property these fritter feed the flame like a plethoric burning martyr or a self consuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supply his own fuel and burn by his own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time it ha an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such a may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyre it smell like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit by midnight the work were in full operation we were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind wa freshening the wild ocean darkness wa intense but that darkness wa licked up by the fierce flame which at interval forked forth from the sooty flue and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging a with the famed greek fire the burning ship drove on a if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur freighted brig of the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbor with broad sheet of flame for sail bore down upon the turkish frigate and folded them in conflagration the hatch removed from the top of the work now afforded a wide hearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shape of the pagan harpooneer always the whale ship s stoker with huge pronged pole they pitched hissing mass of blubber into the scalding pot or stirred up the fire beneath till the snaky flame darted curling out of the door to catch them by the foot the smoke rolled away in sullen heap to every pitch of the ship there wa a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their face opposite the mouth of the work on the further side of the wide wooden hearth wa the windlass this served for a sea sofa here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eye felt scorched in their head their tawny feature now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beard and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the work a they narrated to each other their unholy adventure their tale of terror told in word of mirth a their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flame from the furnace a to and fro in their front the harpooneer wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged fork and dipper a the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all side then the rushing pequod freighted with savage and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander s soul so seemed it to me a i stood at her helm and for long hour silently guided the way of this fire ship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shape before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred vision in my soul so soon a i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i wa horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jaw bone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ear wa the low hum of sail just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eye were open i wa half conscious of putting my finger to the lid and mechanically stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flash of redness uppermost wa the impression that whatever swift rushing thing i stood on wa not so much bound to any haven ahead a rushing from all haven astern a stark bewildered feeling a of death came over me convulsively my hand grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller wa somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and wa fronting the ship s stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when it redness make all thing look ghastly to morrow in the natural sun the sky will be bright those who glared like devil in the forking flame the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lamp all others but liar nevertheless the sun hide not virginia s dismal swamp nor rome s accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the million of mile of desert and of grief beneath the moon the sun hide not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two third of this earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal man can not be true not true or undeveloped with book the same the truest of all men wa the man of sorrow and the truest of all book is solomon s and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomon s wisdom yet but he who dodge hospital and jail and walk fast crossing graveyard and would rather talk of opera than hell call cowper young pascal rousseau poor devil all of sick men and throughout a care free lifetime swears by rabelais a passing wise and therefore jolly not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb stone and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon but even solomon he say the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain i e even while living in the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee a for the time it did me there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill eagle in some soul that can alike dive down into the blackest gorge and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny space and even if he for ever fly within the gorge that gorge is in the mountain so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other bird upon the plain even though they soar chapter the lamp had you descended from the pequod s try work to the pequod s forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized king and counsellor there they lay in their triangular oaken vault each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamp flashing upon his hooded eye in merchantman oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queen to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman a he seek the food of light so he life in light he make his berth an aladdin s lamp and lay him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ship s black hull still house an illumination see with what entire freedom the whaleman take his handful of lamp often but old bottle and vial though to the copper cooler at the try work and replenishes them there a mug of ale at a vat he burn too the purest of oil in it unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivance ashore it is sweet a early grass butter in april he go and hunt for his oil so a to be sure of it freshness and genuineness even a the traveller on the prairie hunt up his own supper of game chapter stowing down and clearing up already ha it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast head how he is chased over the watery moor and slaughtered in the valley of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garment in which the beheaded wa killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pot and like shadrach meshach and abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pas unscathed through the fire but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing singing if i may the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the cask and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan return to his native profundity sliding along beneath the surface a before but ala never more to rise and blow while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the six barrel cask and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous cask are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slide till at last man handled and stayed in their course and all round the hoop rap rap go a many hammer a can play upon them for now ex officio every sailor is a cooper at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchway are unsealed the bowel of the ship are thrown open and down go the cask to their final rest in the sea this done the hatch are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incident in all the business of whaling one day the plank stream with freshet of blood and oil on the sacred quarter deck enormous mass of the whale s head are profanely piled great rusty cask lie about a in a brewery yard the smoke from the try work ha besooted all the bulwark the mariner go about suffused with unctuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hand the din is deafening but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ear in this self same ship and were it not for the tell tale boat and try work you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the deck never look so white a just after what they call an affair of oil besides from the ash of the burned scrap of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hand go diligently along the bulwark and with bucket of water and rag restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower rigging all the numerous implement which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try work completely hiding the pot every cask is out of sight all tackle are coiled in unseen nook and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship s company the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablution shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow a bridegroom new leaped from out the daintiest holland now with elated step they pace the plank in two and three and humorously discourse of parlor sofa carpet and fine cambric propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to such musked mariner of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and bring u napkin but mark aloft there at the three mast head stand three men intent on spying out more whale which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small grease spot somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest uninterrupted labor which know no night continuing straight through for ninety six hour when from the boat where they have swelled their wrist with all day rowing on the line they only step to the deck to carry vast chain and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweating to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fire of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try work when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellow just buttoning the neck of their clean frock are startled by the cry of there she blow and away they fly to fight another whale and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friend but this is man killing yet this is life for hardly have we mortal by long toilings extracted from this world s vast bulk it small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from it defilement and learned to live here in clean tabernacle of the soul hardly is this done when there she blow the ghost is spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young life s old routine again oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two thousand year ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailed with thee along the peruvian coast last voyage and foolish a i am taught thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope chapter the doubloon ere now it ha been related how ahab wa wont to pace his quarter deck taking regular turn at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other thing requiring narration it ha not been added how that sometimes in these walk when most plunged in his mood he wa wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then a the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness but one morning turning to pas the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figure and inscription stamped on it a though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all thing else all thing are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload a they do hill about boston to fill up some morass in the milky way now this doubloon wa of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hill whence east and west over golden sand the head water of many a pactolus flow and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolt and the verdigris of copper spike yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved it quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hand and through the livelong night shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it wa set apart and sanctified to one awe striking end and however wanton in their sailor way one and all the mariner revered it a the white whale s talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it wa to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it now those noble golden coin of south america are a medal of the sun and tropic token piece here palm alpaca and volcano sun s disk and star ecliptic horn of plenty and rich banner waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glory by passing through those fancy mint so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod wa a most wealthy example of these thing on it round border it bore the letter republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that know no autumn zoned by those letter you saw the likeness of three andes summit from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all wa a segment of the partitioned zodiac the sign all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others wa now pausing there s something ever egotistical in mountain top and tower and all other grand and lofty thing look here three peak a proud a lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magician s glass to each and every man in turn but mirror back his own mysterious self great pain small gain for those who ask the world to solve them it can not solve itself methinks now this coined sun wear a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storm the equinox and but six month before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in throe ti fit that man should live in pain and die in pang so be it then here s stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then no fairy finger can have pressed the gold but devil s claw must have left their moulding there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwark the old man seems to read belshazzar s awful writing i

hey hey jenny jenny and get your hoe cake done chapter leg and arm the pequod of nantucket meet the samuel enderby of london ship ahoy hast seen the white whale so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colour bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man wa standing in his hoisted quarter boat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who wa carelessly reclining in his own boat s bow he wa a darkly tanned burly good natured fine looking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoon of blue pilot cloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar s surcoat hast seen the white whale see you this and withdrawing it from the fold that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oar near him stand by to lower in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it wa always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment s warning now it is no very easy matter for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemen to clamber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea for the great swell now lift the boat high up towards the bulwark and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain it ha before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and in the present instance all this wa heightened by the sight of the two officer of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully ornamented man rope for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannister but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affair stood cried out i see i see avast heaving there jump boy and swing over the cutting tackle a good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackle were still aloft and the massive curved blubber hook now clean and dry wa still attached to the end this wa quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it wa like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand upon one of the running part of the tackle soon he wa carefully swung inside the high bulwark and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two sword fish blade cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let u shake bone together an arm and a leg an arm that never can shrink d ye see and a leg that never can run where did st thou see the white whale how long ago the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the east and taking a rueful sight along it a if it had been a telescope there i saw him on the line last season and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the englishman s shoulder a he did so aye he wa the cause of it at least and that leg too spin me the yarn said ahab how wa it it wa the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman i wa ignorant of the white whale at that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whale and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he wa too that went milling and milling round so that my boat s crew could only trim dish by sitting all their stern on the outer gunwale presently up breach from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milky white head and hump all crow foot and wrinkle it wa he it wa he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath and harpoon sticking in near his starboard fin aye aye they were mine my iron cried ahab exultingly but on give me a chance then said the englishman good humoredly well this old great grandfather with the white head and hump run all afoam into the pod and go to snapping furiously at my fast line aye i see wanted to part it free the fast fish an old trick i know him how it wa exactly continued the one armed commander i do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didn t know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whale s that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matter stood and what a noble great whale it wa the noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in my life i resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the hap hazard line would get loose or the tooth it wa tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boat s crew for a pull on a whale line seeing all this i say i jumped into my first mate s boat mr mounttop s here by the way captain mounttop mounttop the captain a i wa saying i jumped into mounttop s boat which d ye see wa gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old great grandfather have it but lord look you sir heart and soul alive man the next instant in a jiff i wa blind a a bat both eye out all befogged and bedeadened with black foam the whale s tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but a i wa groping at midday with a blinding sun all crown jewel a i wa groping i say after the second iron to toss it overboard down come the tail like a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinter and fluke first the white hump backed through the wreck a though it wa all chip we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoon pole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forward went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down to hell s flame i wa thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript it way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my arm came out nigh my wrist and up i floated and that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captain dr bunger ship s surgeon bunger my lad the captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face wa an exceedingly round but sober one he wa dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pill box held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limb of the two crippled captain but at his superior s introduction of him to ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captain s bidding it wa a shocking bad wound began the whale surgeon and taking my advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the one armed captain addressing ahab go on boy stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the line but it wa no use i did all i could sat up with him night wa very severe with him in the matter of diet oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice drinking hot rum toddy with me every night till he couldn t see to put on the bandage and sending me to bed half sea over about three o clock in the morning oh ye star he sat up with me indeed and wa very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why don t ye you know you re a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead boy i d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sir said the imperturbable godly looking bunger slightly bowing to ahab is apt to be facetious at time he spin u many clever thing of that sort but i may a well say en passant a the french remark that i myself that is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy am a strict total abstinence man i never drink water cried the captain he never drink it it s a sort of fit to him fresh water throw him into the hydrophobia but go on go on with the arm story yes i may a well said the surgeon coolly i wa about observing sir before captain boomer s facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavor the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth wa sir it wa a ugly gaping wound a surgeon ever saw more than two foot and several inch long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew black i knew what wa threatened and off it came but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rule pointing at it with the marlingspike that is the captain s work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that club hammer there put to the end to knock some one s brain out with i suppose a he tried mine once he fly into diabolical passion sometimes do ye see this dent sir removing his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl like cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a wound well the captain there will tell you how that came here he know no i don t said the captain but his mother did he wa born with it oh you solemn rogue you you bunger wa there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future age you rascal what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by play between the two englishman oh cried the one armed captain oh yes well after he sounded we didn t see him again for some time in fact a i before hinted i didn t then know what whale it wa that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby dick a some call him and then i knew it wa he did st thou cross his wake again twice but could not fasten didn t want to try to ain t one limb enough what should i do without this other arm and i m thinking moby dick doesn t bite so much a he swallow well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to get the right do you know gentleman very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession do you know gentleman that the digestive organ of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man s arm and he know it too so that what you take for the white whale s malice is only his awkwardness for he never mean to swallow a single limb he only think to terrify by feint but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that making believe swallow jack knife once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tack d ye see no possible way for him to digest that jack knife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly that s all no thank ye bunger said the english captain he s welcome to the arm he ha since i can t help it and didn t know him then but not to another one no more white whale for me i ve lowered for him once and that ha satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a ship load of precious sperm in him but hark ye he s best let alone don t you think so captain glancing at the ivory leg he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let alone that accursed thing is not always what least allure he s all a magnet how long since thou saw st him last which way heading bless my soul and curse the foul fiend s cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this man s blood bring the thermometer it s at the boiling point his pulse make these plank beat sir taking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to ahab s arm avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwark man the boat which way heading good god cried the english captain to whom the question wa put what s the matter he wa heading east i think is your captain crazy whispering fedallah but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwark to take the boat s steering oar and ahab swinging the cutting tackle towards him commanded the ship s sailor to stand by to lower in a moment he wa standing in the boat s stern and the manilla men were springing to their oar in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod chapter the decanter ere the english ship fade from sight be it set down here that she hailed from london and wa named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby son a house which in my poor whaleman s opinion come not far behind the united royal house of the tudor and bourbon in point of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord this great whaling house wa in existence my numerous fish document do not make plain but in that year it fitted out the first english ship that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of year previous ever since our valiant coffin and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleet pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him in a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and wa the first among the nation to lower a whale boat of any sort in the great south sea the voyage wa a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelia s example wa soon followed by other ship english and american and thus the vast sperm whale ground of the pacific were thrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his son how many their mother only know and under their immediate auspex and partly i think at their expense the british government wa induced to send the sloop of war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval post captain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much doe not appear but this is not all in the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote water of japan that ship well called the syren made a noble experimental cruise and it wa thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known the syren in this famous voyage wa commanded by a captain coffin a nantucketer all honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world the ship named after him wa worthy of the honor being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle it wa a fine gam we had and they were all trump every soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine gam i had long very long after old ahab touched her plank with his ivory heel it mind me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallon the hour and when the squall came for it s squally off there by patagonia and all hand visitor and all were called to reef topsail we were so top heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowline and we ignorantly furled the skirt of our jacket into the sail so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tar however the mast did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pas the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste the beef wa fine tough but with body in it they said it wa bull beef others that it wa dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that wa they had dumpling too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumpling i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiard ball the bread but that couldn t be helped besides it wa an anti scorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle wa not very light and it wa very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimension of the cook s boiler including his own live parchment boiler fore and aft i say the samuel enderby wa a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellow all and capital from boot heel to hat band but why wa it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whaler i know of not all though were such famous hospitable ship that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whaler is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it ha seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollander zealander and dane from whom they derived many term still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashion touching plenty to eat and drink for a a general thing the english merchant ship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated during my research in the leviathanic history i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whaler the title wa dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoir of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery a every whale ship must carry it cooper i wa reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it wa the production of one fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st pott s to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candle for his trouble this same dr snodhead so soon a he spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subject contained a very interesting account of it whale fishery and in this chapter it wa headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the outfit for the larder and cellar of sail of dutch whalemen from which list a translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following lb of beef lb friesland pork lb of stock fish lb of biscuit lb of soft bread firkin of butter lb texel leyden cheese lb cheese probably an inferior article ankers of geneva barrel of beer most statistical table are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipe barrel quart and gill of good gin and good cheer at the time i devoted three day to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thought were incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary table of my own touching the probable quantity of stock fish etc consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unctuous nature being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar sea on the very coast of that esquimaux country where the convivial native pledge each other in bumper of train oil the quantity of beer too is very large barrel now a those polar fishery could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three month say and reckoning men to each of their fleet of sail we have low dutch seaman in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrel of beer per man for a twelve week allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that ankers of gin now whether these gin and beer harpooneer so fuddled a one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat s head and take good aim at flying whale this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this wa very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more enough ha been said to show that the old dutch whaler of two or three century ago were high liver and that the english whaler have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empty the decanter chapter a bower in the arsacides hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvel of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural feature but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the point of his hose unbuckling his garter and casting loose the hook and the eye of the joint of his innermost bone set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean part of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lecture on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a full grown whale on your deck for examination a a cook dish a roast pig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joist and beam the rafter ridge pole sleeper and under pinning making up the frame work of leviathan and belike of the tallow vat dairy room buttery and cheeseries in his bowel i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale wa once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheath for the barb of the harpoon and for the head of the lance think you i let that chance go without using my boat hatchet and jack knife and breaking the seal and reading all the content of that young cub and a for my exact knowledge of the bone of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque year ago when attached to the trading ship dey of algiers i wa invited to spend part of the arsacidean holiday with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a sea side glen not very far distant from what our sailor called bamboo town his capital among many other fine quality my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matter of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare thing the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved wood of wonderful device chiselled shell inlaid spear costly paddle aromatic canoe and all these distributed among whatever natural wonder the wonder freighted tribute rendering wave had cast upon his shore chief among these latter wa a great sperm whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoa nut tree whose plumage like tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of it fathom deep enfolding and the bone become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton wa carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palm now sheltered it the rib were hung with trophy the vertebr were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphic in the skull the priest kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth it vapory spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotee like the hair hung sword that so affrighted damocles it wa a wondrous sight the wood wa green a moss of the icy glen the tree stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath wa a a weaver s loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the ground vine tendril formed the warp and woof and the living flower the figure all the tree with all their laden branch all the shrub and fern and grass the message carrying air all these unceasingly were active through the lacing of the leaf the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver pause one word whither flow the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings speak weaver stay thy hand but one single word with thee nay the shuttle fly the figure float from forth the loom the freshet rushing carpet for ever slide away the weaver god he weave and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voice that speak through it for even so it is in all material factory the spoken word that are inaudible among the flying spindle those same word are plainly heard without the wall bursting from the opened casement thereby have villainy been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great world s loom thy subtlest thinking may be overheard afar now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler yet a the ever woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vine every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curly headed glory now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel a an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priest should swear that smoky jet of his wa genuine to and fro i paced before this skeleton brushed the vine aside broke through the rib and with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid it many winding shaded colonnade and arbour but soon my line wa out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught wa there but bone cutting me a green measuring rod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrow slit in the skull the priest perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted dar st thou measure this our god that s for u aye priest well how long do ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning foot and inch they cracked each other s sconce with their yard stick the great skull echoed and seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please because there are skeleton authority you can refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling port of that country where they have some fine specimen of fin back and other whale likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietor call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united state moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable ha in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no mean of the full grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo s in both case the stranded whale to which these two skeleton belonged were originally claimed by their proprietor upon similar ground king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir clifford because he wa lord of the seignories of those part sir clifford s whale ha been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawer you can open and shut him in all his bony cavity spread out his rib like a gigantic fan and swing all day upon his lower jaw lock are to be put upon some of his trap door and shutter and a footman will show round future visitor with a bunch of key at his side sir clifford think of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead the skeleton dimension i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed a in my wild wandering at that period there wa no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistic but a i wa crowded for space and wished the other part of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i wa then composing at least what untattooed part might remain i did not trouble myself with the odd inch nor indeed should inch at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter measurement of the whale s skeleton in the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base upon captain scoresby s estimate of seventy ton for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty foot in length according to my careful calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between eighty five and ninety foot in length and something less than forty foot in it fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety ton so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitant think you not then that brain like yoked cattle should be put to this leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsman s imagination having already in various way put before you his skull spout hole jaw teeth tail forehead fin and diver other part i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bone but a the colossal skull embrace so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton a it is by far the most complicated part and a nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm a we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view in length the sperm whale s skeleton at tranque measured seventy two foot so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety foot long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventy two foot his skull and jaw comprised some twenty foot leaving some fifty foot of plain back bone attached to this back bone for something less than a third of it length wa the mighty circular basket of rib which once enclosed his vitals to me this vast ivory ribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new laid upon the stock when only some twenty of her naked bow rib are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber the rib were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck wa nearly six foot long the second third and fourth were each successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle rib which measured eight foot and some inch from that part the remaining rib diminished till the tenth and last only spanned five foot and some inch in general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length the middle rib were the most arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beam whereon to lay footpath bridge over small stream in considering these rib i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no mean the mould of his invested form the largest of the tranque rib one of the middle one occupied that part of the fish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen foot whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight foot so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with ton of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowel still more for the ample fin i here saw but a few disordered joint and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless fluke an utter blank how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest peril only when within the eddyings of his angry fluke only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile it bone high up on end no speedy enterprise but now it s done it look much like pompey s pillar there are forty and odd vertebr in all which in the skeleton are not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed block on a gothic spire forming solid course of heavy masonry the largest a middle one is in width something less than three foot and in depth more than four the smallest where the spine taper away into the tail is only two inch in width and look something like a white billiard ball i wa told that there were still smaller one but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchin the priest s child who had stolen them to play marble with thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living thing taper off at last into simple child s play chapter the fossil whale from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not compress him by good right he should only be treated of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlong from spiracle to tail and the yard he measure about the waist only think of the gigantic involution of his intestine where they lie in him like great cable and hawser coiled away in the subterranean orlop deck of a line of battle ship since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germ of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowel having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarity it now remains to magnify him in an arch ological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the leviathan to an ant or a flea such portly term might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest word of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it ha been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertation i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographer s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me one often hears of writer that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capital give me a condor s quill give me vesuvius crater for an inkstand friend hold my arm for in the mere act of penning my thought of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep a if to include the whole circle of the science and all the generation of whale and men and mastodon past present and to come with all the revolving panorama of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding it suburb such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to it bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it ere entering upon the subject of fossil whale i present my credential a a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stone mason and also a great digger of ditch canal and well wine vault cellar and cistern of all sort likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological stratum there are found the fossil of monster now almost completely extinct the subsequent relic discovered in what are called the tertiary formation seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted link between the antichronical creature and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whale hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last preceding the superficial formation and though none of them precisely answer to any known specie of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respect to justify their taking rank a cetacean fossil detached broken fossil of pre adamite whale fragment of their bone and skeleton have within thirty year past at various interval been found at the base of the alp in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the state of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year wa disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bone disinterred in excavating the great dock of antwerp in napoleon s time cuvier pronounced these fragment to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic specie but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relic wa the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awe stricken credulous slave in the vicinity took it for the bone of one of the fallen angel the alabama doctor declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bone of it being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile wa a whale though of a departed specie a significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creature which the mutation of the globe have blotted out of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeleton skull tusk jaw rib and vertebr all characterized by partial resemblance to the existing breed of sea monster but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinity to the annihilated antichronical leviathan their incalculable senior i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man here saturn s grey chaos roll over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpse into those polar eternity when wedged bastion of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropic and in all the mile of this world s circumference not an inhabitable hand s breadth of land wa visible then the whole world wa the whale s and king of creation he left his wake along the present line of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan ahab s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh s methuselah seems a school boy i look round to shake hand with shem i am horror struck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terror of the whale which having been before all time must need exist after all humane age are over but not alone ha this leviathan left his pre adamite trace in the stereotype plate of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon egyptian tablet whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some fifty year ago there wa discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaur griffin and dolphin similar to the grotesque figure on the celestial globe of the modern gliding among them old leviathan swam a of yore wa there swimming in that planisphere century before solomon wa cradled nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous post diluvian reality a set down by the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller not far from the sea side they have a temple the rafter and beam of which are made of whale bone for whale of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pas it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rock that shoot two mile into the sea and wound the whale when they light upon em they keep a whale s rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with it convex part uppermost make an arch the head of which can not be reached by a man upon a camel s back this rib say john leo is said to have layn there a hundred year before i saw it their historian affirm that a prophet who prophesy d of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas wa cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there chapter doe the whale s magnitude diminish will he perish inasmuch then a this leviathan come floundering down upon u from the head water of the eternity it may be fitly inquired whether in the long course of his generation he ha not degenerated from the original bulk of his sire but upon investigation we find that not only are the whale of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whale found in that tertiary system those belonging to it latter formation exceed in size those of it earlier one of all the pre adamite whale yet exhumed by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that wa less than seventy foot in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tape measure give seventy two foot for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemen s authority that sperm whale have been captured near a hundred foot long at the time of capture but may it not be that while the whale of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological period may it not be that since adam s time they have degenerated assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the account of such gentleman a pliny and the ancient naturalist generally for pliny tell u of whale that embraced acre of living bulk and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred foot in length rope walk and thames tunnel of whale and even in the day of bank and solander cooke s naturalist we find a danish member of the academy of science setting down certain iceland whale reydan siskur or wrinkled belly at one hundred and twenty yard that is three hundred and sixty foot and lac p de the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whale in the very beginning of his work page set down the right whale at one hundred metre three hundred and twenty eight foot and this work wa published so late a a d but will any whaleman believe these story no the whale of to day is a big a his ancestor in pliny s time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he wa will make bold to tell him so because i can not understand how it is that while the egyptian mummy that were buried thousand of year before even pliny wa born do not measure so much in their coffin a a modern kentuckian in his sock and while the cattle and other animal sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablet by the relative proportion in which they are drawn just a plainly prove that the high bred stall fed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh s fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of all animal the whale alone should have degenerated but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient look out at the mast head of the whale ship now penetrating even through behring s strait and into the remotest secret drawer and locker of the world and the thousand harpoon and lance darted along all continental coast the moot point is whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the water and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff comparing the humped herd of whale with the humped herd of buffalo which not forty year ago overspread by ten of thousand the prairie of illinois and missouri and shook their iron mane and scowled with their thunder clotted brow upon the site of populous river capital where now the polite broker sell you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale can not now escape speedy extinction but you must look at this matter in every light though so short a period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination wa the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whale hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whale for forty eight month think they have done extremely well and thank god if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the day of the old canadian and indian hunter and trapper of the west when the far west in whose sunset sun still rise wa a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of month mounted on horse instead of sailing in ship would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more buffalo a fact that if need were could be statistically stated nor considered aright doe it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former year the latter part of the last century say these leviathan in small pod were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyage were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because a ha been elsewhere noticed those whale influenced by some view to safety now swim the sea in immense caravan so that to a large degree the scattered solitary yoke and pod and school of other day are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent army that is all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the so called whale bone whale no longer haunt many ground in former year abounding with them hence that specie also is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jet then be sure some other and remoter strand ha been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathan they have two firm fortress which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable and a upon the invasion of their valley the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountain so hunted from the savanna and glade of the middle sea the whale bone whale can at last resort to their polar citadel and diving under the ultimate glassy barrier and wall there come up among icy field and floe and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man but a perhaps fifty of these whale bone whale are harpooned for one cachalot some philosopher of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc ha already very seriously diminished their battalion but though for some time past a number of these whale not less than have been annually slain on the nor west coast by the american alone yet there are consideration which render even this circumstance of little or no account a an opposing argument in this matter natural a it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creature of the globe yet what shall we say to harto the historian of goa when he tell u that at one hunting the king of siam took elephant that in those region elephant are numerous a drove of cattle in the temperate clime and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephant which have now been hunted for thousand of year by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarch of the east if they still survive there in great number much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he ha a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice a large a all asia both america europe and africa new holland and all the isle of the sea combined moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whale their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generation must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the grave yard cemetery and family vault of creation yielding up the live body of all the men woman and child who were alive seventy five year ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe wherefore for all these thing we account the whale immortal in his specie however perishable in his individuality he swam the sea before the continent broke water he once swam over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noah s flood he despised noah s ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the netherlands to kill off it rat then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the sky chapter ahab s leg the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half splintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivot hole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it wa a ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearance lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at time give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not been very long prior to the pequod s sailing from nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stake wise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor wa it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound wa entirely cured nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering wa but the direct issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that a the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind a inevitably a the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable event do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teaching that while some natural enjoyment here shall have no child born to them for the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the joy childlessness of all hell s despair whereas some guilty mortal misery shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of grief beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicity ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracing out not belie the obvious deduction to trail the genealogy of these high mortal misery carry u at last among the sourceless primogeniture of the god so that in the face of all the glad hay making sun and soft cymballing round harvest moon we must need give in to this that the god themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sad birth mark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signer unwittingly here a secret ha been divulged which perhaps might more properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other particular concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it wa that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grand lama like exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge a it were among the marble senate of the dead captain peleg s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no mean adequate though indeed a touching all ahab s deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap wa at the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that ever contracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualty remaining a it did moodily unaccounted for by ahab invested itself with terror not entirely underived from the land of spirit and of wail so that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so far a in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it wa that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequod s deck but be all this a it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive prince and potentate of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedure he called the carpenter and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mate to see him supplied with all the stud and joist of jaw ivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearest grained stuff might be secured this done the carpenter received order to have the leg completed that night and to provide all the fitting for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ship s forge wa ordered to be hoisted out of it temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith wa commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivance might be needed chapter the carpenter seat thyself sultanically among the moon of saturn and take high abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicate both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he wa and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the pequod s carpenter wa no duplicate hence he now come in person on this stage like all sea going ship carpenter and more especially those belonging to whaling vessel he wa to a certain off handed practical extent alike experienced in numerous trade and calling collateral to his own the carpenter s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicraft which more or less have to do with wood a an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod wa singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergency continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four year voyage in uncivilized and far distant sea for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duty repairing stove boat sprung spar reforming the shape of clumsy bladed oar inserting bull s eye in the deck or new tree nail in the side plank and other miscellaneous matter more directly pertaining to his special business he wa moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitude both useful and capricious the one grand stage where he enacted all his various part so manifold wa his vice bench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vice of different size and both of iron and of wood at all time except when whale were alongside this bench wa securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try work a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into it hole the carpenter clap it into one of his ever ready vice and straightway file it smaller a lost land bird of strange plumage stray on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rod of right whale bone and cross beam of sperm whale ivory the carpenter make a pagoda looking cage for it an oarsman sprain his wrist the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion star to be painted upon the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supply the constellation a sailor take a fancy to wear shark bone ear ring the carpenter drill his ear another ha the toothache the carpenter out pincer and clapping one hand upon his bench bid him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably wince under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter sign him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth thus this carpenter wa prepared at all point and alike indifferent and without respect in all teeth he accounted bit of ivory head he deemed but top block men themselves he lightly held for capstan but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing wa this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity a it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of thing that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted mode still eternally hold it peace and ignores you though you dig foundation for cathedral yet wa this half horrible stolidity in him involving too a it appeared an all ramifying heartlessness yet wa it oddly dashed at time with an old crutch like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such a might have served to pas the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah s ark wa it that this old carpenter had been a life long wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he wa a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised a a new born babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trade he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he wa a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscle of his finger he wa like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivance assuming the exterior though a little swelled of a common pocket knife but containing not only blade of various size but also screw driver cork screw tweezer awl pen ruler nail filer countersinkers so if his superior wanted to use the carpenter for a screw driver all they had to do wa to open that part of him and the screw wa fast or if for tweezer take him up by the leg and there they were yet a previously hinted this omnitooled open and shut carpenter wa after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did it duty what that wa whether essence of quicksilver or a few drop of hartshorn there is no telling but there it wa and there it had abided for now some sixty year or more and this it wa this same unaccountable cunning life principle in him this it wa that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body wa a sentry box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake chapter ahab and the carpenter the deck first night watch carpenter standing before his vice bench and by the light of two lantern busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is firmly fixed in the vice slab of ivory leather strap pad screw and various tool of all sort lying about the bench forward the red flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work drat the file and drat the bone that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard so we go who file old jaw and shinbone let s try another aye now this work better sneeze halloa this bone dust is sneeze why it s sneeze yes it s sneeze bless my soul it won t let me speak this is what an old fellow get now for working in dead lumber saw a live tree and you don t get this dust amputate a live bone and you don t get it sneeze come come you old smut there bear a hand and let s have that ferule and buckle screw i ll be ready for them presently lucky now sneeze there s no knee joint to make that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbone why it s easy a making hop pole only i should like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i could turn him out a neat a leg now a ever sneeze scraped to a lady in a parlor those buckskin leg and calf of leg i ve seen in shop window wouldn t compare at all they soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneeze with wash and lotion just like live leg there before i saw it off now i must call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right too short if anything i guess ha that s the heel we are in luck here he come or it s somebody else that s certain ahab advancing during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at time well manmaker just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length let me measure sir measured for a leg good well it s not the first time about it there keep thy finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel it grip once so so it doe pinch some oh sir it will break bone beware beware no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man what s prometheus about there the blacksmith i mean what s he about he must be forging the buckle screw sir now right it s a partnership he supply the muscle part he make a fierce red flame there aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work um m so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for what s made in fire must properly belong to fire and so hell s probable how the soot fly this must be the remainder the greek made the african of carpenter when he s through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder blade there s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack sir hold while prometheus is about it i ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern imprimis fifty foot high in his sock then chest modelled after the thames tunnel then leg with root to em to stay in one place then arm three foot through the wrist no heart at all brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brain and let me see shall i order eye to see outwards no but put a sky light on top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away now what s he speaking about and who s he speaking to i should like to know shall i keep standing here aside ti but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome here s one no no no i must have a lantern ho ho that s it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn what art thou thrusting that thief catcher into my face for man thrusted light is worse than presented pistol i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter carpenter why that s but no a very tidy and i may say an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here carpenter or would st thou rather work in clay sir clay clay sir that s mud we leave clay to ditchers sir the fellow s impious what art thou sneezing about bone is rather dusty sir take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living people s nose sir oh ah i guess so yes oh dear look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that old adam away truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at time may i humbly ask if it be really so sir it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once wa so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do i is t a riddle i should humbly call it a poser sir hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hour then dost thou not fear eavesdropper hold don t speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pain of hell for ever and without a body hah good lord truly sir if it come to that i must calculate over again i think i didn t carry a small figure sir look ye pudding head should never grant premise how long before the leg is done perhaps an hour sir bungle away at it then and bring it to me turn to go oh life here i am proud a greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal inter indebtedness which will not do away with ledger i would be free a air and i m down in the whole world s book i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest pr torians at the auction of the roman empire which wa the world s and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by heaven i ll get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra so carpenter resuming his work well well well stubb know him best of all and stubb always say he s queer say nothing but that one sufficient little word queer he s queer say stubb he s queer queer queer and keep dinning it into mr starbuck all the time queer sir queer queer very queer and here s his leg yes now that i think of it here s his bedfellow ha a stick of whale s jaw bone for a wife and this is his leg he ll stand on this what wa that now about one leg standing in three place and all three place standing in one hell how wa that oh i don t wonder he looked so scornful at me i m a sort of strange thoughted sometimes they say but that s only haphazard like then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep water with tall heron built captain the water chuck you under the chin pretty quick and there s a great cry for life boat and here s the heron s leg long and slim sure enough now for most folk one pair of leg last a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully a a tender hearted old lady us her roly poly old coach horse but ahab oh he s a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wear out bone leg by the cord halloa there you smut bear a hand there with those screw and let s finish it before the resurrection fellow come a calling with his horn for all leg true or false a brewery men go round collecting old beer barrel to fill em up again what a leg this is it look like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core he ll be standing on this to morrow he ll be taking altitude on it halloa i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figure up the latitude so so chisel file and sand paper now chapter ahab and starbuck in the cabin according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the cask below must have sprung a bad leak much concern wa shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair in sperm whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semi weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the cask with sea water which afterwards at varying interval is removed by the ship s pump hereby the cask are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariner readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo now from the south and west the pequod wa drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isle between which lie one of the tropical outlet from the china water into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelago spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coast of the japanese island niphon matsmai and sikoke with his snow white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruning hook of a jack knife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door wa wrinkling his brow and tracing his old course again who s there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it on deck begone captain ahab mistake it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we must up burton and break out up burton and break out now that we are nearing japan heave to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoop either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year what we come twenty thousand mile to get is worth saving sir so it is so it is if we get it i wa speaking of the oil in the hold sir and i wa not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak i m all aleak myself aye leak in leak not only full of leaky cask but those leaky cask are in a leaky ship and that s a far worse plight than the pequod s man yet i don t stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep loaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this life s howling gale starbuck i ll not have the burton hoisted what will the owner say sir let the owner stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoon what care ahab owner owner thou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owner a if the owner were my conscience but look ye the only real owner of anything is it commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ship s keel on deck captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself a better man than i might well pas over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab devil dost thou then so much a dare to critically think of me on deck nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sir to be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most south sea men s cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequod on deck for an instant in the flashing eye of the mate and his fiery cheek you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and a he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man he wax brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured ahab a starbuck disappeared what s that he said ahab beware of ahab there s something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plait of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the t gallant sail and close reef the top sail fore and aft back the main yard up burton and break out in the main hold it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it wa that a respecting starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship however it wa his order were executed and the burton were hoisted chapter queequeg in his coffin upon searching it wa found that the cask last struck into the hold were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumber of the huge ground tier butt and from that black midnight sending those gigantic mole into the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner stone cask containing coin of captain noah with copy of the posted placard vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shook of stave and iron bundle of hoop were hoisted out till at last the piled deck were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot a if you were treading over empty catacomb and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air freighted demijohn top heavy wa the ship a a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well wa it that the typhoon did not visit them then now at this time it wa that my poor pagan companion and fast bosom friend queequeg wa seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his endless end be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecure are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who a harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale but a we have elsewhere seen mount his dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest cask and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneer are the holder so called poor queequeg when the ship wa about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawer the tattooed savage wa crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well and a well or an ice house it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweating he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some day suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few long lingering day till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but a all else in him thinned and his cheek bone grew sharper his eye nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like circle on the water which a they grow fainter expand so his eye seemed rounding and rounding like the ring of eternity an awe that can not be named would steal over you a you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw a strange thing in his face a any beheld who were bystander when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet wa put into word or book and the drawing near of death which alike level all alike impress all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell so that let u say it again no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thought than those whose mysterious shade you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg a he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the ocean s invisible flood tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven not a man of the crew but gave him up and a for queequeg himself what he thought of his case wa forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day wa just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoe of dark wood like the rich war wood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoe and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it wa not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelago for not only do they believe that the star are isle but that far beyond all visible horizon their own mild uncontinented sea interflow with the blue heaven and so form the white breaker of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual sea custom tossed like something vile to the death devouring shark no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whale boat these coffin canoe were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much lee way adown the dim age now when this strange circumstance wa made known aft the carpenter wa at once commanded to do queequeg s bidding whatever it might include there wa some heathenish coffin coloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal grove of the lackaday island and from these dark plank the coffin wa recommended to be made no sooner wa the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took queequeg s measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequeg s person a he shifted the rule ah poor fellow he ll have to die now ejaculated the long island sailor going to his vice bench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin wa to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notch at it extremity this done he marshalled the plank and his tool and to work when the last nail wa driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction overhearing the indignant but half humorous cry with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every one s consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor wa there any denying him seeing that of all mortal some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble u so little for evermore the poor fellow ought to be indulged leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddle of his boat all by his own request also biscuit were then ranged round the side within a flask of fresh water wa placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sail cloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of it comfort if any it had he lay without moving a few minute then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god yojo then crossing his arm on his breast with yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock but ere this wa done pip who had been slily hovering near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbing took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the current carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beach are only beat with water lily will ye do one little errand for me seek out one pip who s now been missing long i think he s in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look he s left his tambourine behind i found it rig a dig dig dig now queequeg die and i ll beat ye your dying march i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in violent fever men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongue and that when the mystery is probed it turn out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongue had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholar so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly voucher of all our heavenly home where learned he that but there hark he speaks again but more wildly now form two and two let s make a general of him ho where s his harpoon lay it across here rig a dig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dy game mind ye that queequeg dy game take ye good heed of that queequeg dy game i say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all a shiver out upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles he s a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from a whale boat i d never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all coward shame upon them let em go drown like pip that jumped from a whale boat shame shame during all this queequeg lay with closed eye a if in a dream pip wa led away and the sick man wa replaced in his hammock but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin wa proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenter s box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence wa this at a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he wa leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred they asked him then whether to live or die wa a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word it wa queequeg s conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six month convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost half well again in a day so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent day but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his foot threw out his arm and leg gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a sea chest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there many spare hour he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figure and drawing and it seemed that hereby he wa striving in his rude way to copy part of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic mark had written out on his body a complete theory of the heaven and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own proper person wa a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mystery not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mystery were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg oh devilish tantalization of the god chapter the pacific when gliding by the bashee isle we emerged at last upon the great south sea were it not for other thing i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth wa answered that serene ocean rolled eastward from me a thousand league of blue there is one know not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirring seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulation of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st john and meet it is that over these sea pasture wide rolling watery prairie and potter field of all four continent the wave should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here million of mixed shade and shadow drowned dream somnambulism revery all that we call life and soul lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberer in their bed the ever rolling wave but made so by their restlessness to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption it roll the midmost water of the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but it arm the same wave wash the mole of the new built californian town but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirt of asiatic land older than abraham while all between float milky way of coral isle and low lying endless unknown archipelago and impenetrable japan thus this mysterious divine pacific zone the world s whole bulk about make all coast one bay to it seems the tide beating heart of earth lifted by those eternal swell you need must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan but few thought of pan stirred ahab s brain a standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isle in whose sweet wood mild lover must be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at length upon these almost final water and gliding towards the japanese cruising ground the old man s purpose intensified itself his firm lip met like the lip of a vice the delta of his forehead s vein swelled like overladen brook in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spout thick blood chapter the blacksmith availing himself of the mild summer cool weather that now reigned in these latitude and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuit shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blistered old blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding his contributory work for ahab s leg but still retained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsman and harpooneer and bowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various weapon and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holding boat spade pike head harpoon and lance and jealously watching his every sooty movement a he toiled nevertheless this old man s wa a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away a if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it wa most miserable a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariner and to the importunity of their persisted questioning he had finally given in and so it came to pas that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate belated and not innocently one bitter winter s midnight on the road running between two country town the blacksmith half stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn the issue wa the loss of the extremity of both foot out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four act of the gladness and the one long and a yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life s drama he wa an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow s technical called ruin he had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughter like loving wife and three blithe ruddy child every sunday went to a cheerful looking church planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family s heart it wa the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for prudent most wise and economic reason the blacksmith s shop wa in the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her young armed old husband s hammer whose reverberation muffled by passing through the floor and wall came up to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout labor s iron lullaby the blacksmith s infant were rocked to slumber oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphan a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after year and all of them a care killing competency but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibility of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest why tell the whole the blow of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eye glitteringly gazing into the weeping face of her child the bellow fell the forge choked up with cinder the house wa sold the mother dived down into the long church yard grass her child twice followed her thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen curl death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but the first salutation to the possibility of the immense remote the wild the watery the unshored therefore to the death longing eye of such men who still have left in them some

matted beard and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron about mid day perth wa standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an iron wood log with one hand holding a pike head in the coal and with the other at his forge s lung when captain ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rusty looking leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvil the red mass sending off the spark in thick hovering flight some of which flew close to ahab are these thy mother carey s chicken perth they are always flying in thy wake bird of good omen too but not to all look here they burn but thou thou liv st among them without a scorch because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily can st thou scorch a scar well well no more thy shrunk voice sound too calmly sanely woeful to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad thou should st go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad how can st thou endure without being mad do the heaven yet hate thee that thou can st not go mad what wert thou making there welding an old pike head sir there were seam and dent in it and can st thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard usage a it had i think so sir and i suppose thou can st smoothe almost any seam and dent never mind how hard the metal blacksmith aye sir i think i can all seam and dent but one look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hand on perth s shoulder look ye here here can ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou could st blacksmith glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eye answer can st thou smoothe this seam oh that is the one sir said i not all seam and dent but one aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only see st it here in my flesh it ha worked down into the bone of my skull that is all wrinkle but away with child s play no more gaff and pike to day look ye here jingling the leathern bag a if it were full of gold coin i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiend could not part perth something that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone there s the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nail stubbs of the steel shoe of racing horse horse shoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmith ever work i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bone of murderer quick forge me the harpoon and forge me first twelve rod for it shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarn and strand of a tow line quick i ll blow the fire when at last the twelve rod were made ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth this done perth wa about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron a then with regular gasping hem he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rod one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up it intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but a ahab looked up he slid aside what s that bunch of lucifer dodging about there for muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle that parsee smell fire like a fusee and smell of it himself like a hot musket s powder pan at last the shank in one complete rod received it final heat and a perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into ahab s bent face would st thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain have i been but forging my own branding iron then pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this harpoon for the white whale for the white fiend but now for the barb thou must make them thyself man here are my razor the best of steel here and make the barb sharp a the needle sleet of the icy sea for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razor a though he would fain not use them take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray till but here to work fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and a the blacksmith wa about giving the barb their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the water cask near no no no water for that i want it of the true death temper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagan will ye give me a much blood a will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nod replied yes three puncture were made in the heathen flesh and the white whale s barb were then tempered ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled ahab a the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood now mustering the spare pole from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron a coil of new tow line wa then unwound and some fathom of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp string then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and now for the seizing at one extremity the rope wa unstranded and the separate spread yarn were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole wa then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope wa traced half way along the pole s length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and rope like the three fate remained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin light unnatural half bantering yet most piteous sound wa heard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummery not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it chapter the gilder penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground the pequod wa soon all astir in the fishery often in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hour on the stretch they were engaged in the boat steadily pulling or sailing or paddling after the whale or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minute calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pain at such time under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swell seated in his boat light a a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft wave themselves that like hearth stone cat they purr against the gunwale these are the time of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean s skin one forgets the tiger heart that pant beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang these are the time when in his whale boat the rover softly feel a certain filial confident land like feeling towards the sea that he regard it a so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing only the top of her mast seems struggling forward not through high rolling wave but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie a when the western emigrant horse only show their erected ear while their hidden body widely wade through the amazing verdure the long drawn virgin vale the mild blue hill side a over these there steal the hush the hum you almost swear that play wearied child lie sleeping in these solitude in some glad may time when the flower of the wood are plucked and all this mix with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy half way meeting interpenetrate and form one seamless whole nor did such soothing scene however temporary fail of at least a temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden key did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasury yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing oh grassy glade oh ever vernal endless landscape in the soul in ye though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life in ye men yet may roll like young horse in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moment feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them would to god these blessed calm would last but the mingled mingling thread of life are woven by warp and woof calm crossed by storm a storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradation and at the last one pause through infancy s unconscious spell boyhood s thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhood s pondering repose of if but once gone through we trace the round again and are infant boy and men and ifs eternally where lie the final harbor whence we unmoor no more in what rapt ether sail the world of which the weariest will never weary where is the foundling s father hidden our soul are like those orphan whose unwedded mother die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lie in their grave and we must there to learn it and that same day too gazing far down from his boat s side into that same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured loveliness unfathomable a ever lover saw in his young bride s eye tell me not of thy teeth tiered shark and thy kidnapping cannibal way let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep down and do believe and stubb fish like with sparkling scale leaped up in that same golden light i am stubb and stubb ha his history but here stubb take oath that he ha always been jolly chapter the pequod meet the bachelor and jolly enough were the sight and the sound that came bearing down before the wind some few week after ahab s harpoon had been welded it wa a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatch and now in glad holiday apparel wa joyously though somewhat vain gloriously sailing round among the widely separated ship on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home the three men at her mast head wore long streamer of narrow red bunting at their hat from the stern a whale boat wa suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit wa seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signal ensign and jack of all colour were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed top were two barrel of sperm above which in her top mast cross tree you saw slender breaker of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck wa a brazen lamp a wa afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same sea numerous other vessel had gone entire month without securing a single fish not only had barrel of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental cask had been bartered for from the ship she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captain s and officer state room even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling wood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil butt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailor had actually caulked and pitched their chest and filled them it wa humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffee pot and filled it that the harpooneer had headed the socket of their iron and filled them that indeed everything wa filled with sperm except the captain s pantaloon pocket and those he reserved to thrust his hand into in self complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction a this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drum came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try pot which covered with the parchment like poke or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hand of the crew on the quarter deck the mate and harpooneer were dancing with the olive hued girl who had eloped with them from the polynesian isle while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negro with glittering fiddle bow of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ship s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try work from which the huge pot had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cry they raised a the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the ship s elevated quarter deck so that the whole rejoicing drama wa full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion and ahab he too wa standing on his quarter deck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and a the two ship crossed each other s wake one all jubilation for thing passed the other all foreboding a to thing to come their two captain in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelor s commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply no only heard of him but don t believe in him at all said the other good humoredly come aboard thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men not enough to speak of two islander that s all but come aboard old hearty come along i ll soon take that black from your brow come along will ye merry s the play a full ship and homeward bound how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outward bound so go thy way and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessel parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glance towards the receding bachelor but the bachelor s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in and a ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homeward bound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote association together for that vial wa filled with nantucket sounding chapter the dying whale not seldom in this life when on the right side fortune s favourite sail close by u we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sail fill out so seemed it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor whale were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab it wa far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orison curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed a if far over from the deep green convent valley of the manilla isle the spanish land breeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymn soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final waning from the now tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whale dying the turning sunwards of the head and so expiring that strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before he turn and turn him to it how slowly but how steadfastly his homage rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motion he too worship fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sun oh that these too favouring eye should see these too favouring sight look here far water locked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial sea where to tradition no

see no sooner dead than death whirl round the corpse and it head some other way oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bone hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured sea thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the wide slaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of it after calm nor ha this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power oh high aspiring rainbowed jet that one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon all quickening sun that only call forth life but give it not again yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyed by breath of once living thing exhaled a air but water now then hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl find his only rest born of earth yet suckled by the sea though hill and valley mothered me ye billow are my foster brother chapter the whale watch the four whale slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by it side all night and that boat wa ahab s the waif pole wa thrust upright into the dead whale s spout hole and the lantern hanging from it top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight wave which gently chafed the whale s broad flank like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the shark that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar plank with their tail a sound like the moaning in squadron over asphaltites of unforgiven ghost of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air started from his slumber ahab face to face saw the parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world i have dreamed it again said he of the hearse have i not said old man that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine and who are hearsed that die on the sea but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearse must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hand and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america aye aye a strange sight that parsee a hearse and it plume floating over the ocean with the wave for the pall bearer ha such a sight we shall not soon see believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man and what wa that saying about thyself though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot and when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then ere i can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me still wa it not so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledge that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it take another pledge old man said the parsee a his eye lighted up like fire fly in the gloom hemp only can kill thee the gallows ye mean i am immortal then on land and on sea cried ahab with a laugh of derision immortal on land and on sea both were silent again a one man the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom and ere noon the dead whale wa brought to the ship chapter the quadrant the season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab coming from his cabin cast his eye aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spoke and the eager mariner quickly run to the brace and would stand there with all their eye centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ship s prow for the equator in good time the order came it wa hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bow of his high hoisted boat wa about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude now in that japanese sea the day in summer are a freshet of effulgence that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean s immeasurable burning glass the sky look lacquered cloud there are none the horizon float and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is a the insufferable splendor of god s throne well that ahab s quadrant wa furnished with coloured glass through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrological looking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moment to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain it precise meridian meantime while his whole attention wa absorbed the parsee wa kneeling beneath him on the ship s deck and with face thrown up like ahab s wa eyeing the same sun with him only the lid of his eye half hooded their orb and his wild face wa subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation wa taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant then falling into a moment s revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself thou sea mark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i am but canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living where is moby dick this instant thou must be eyeing him these eye of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the object on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other it numerous cabalistical contrivance he pondered again and muttered foolish toy baby plaything of haughty admiral and commodore and captain the world brag of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that hold thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to morrow noon and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the thing that cast man s eye aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorch him a these old eye are even now scorched with thy light o sun level by nature to this earth s horizon are the glance of man s eye not shot from the crown of his head a if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee the level ship s compass and the level dead reckoning by log and by line these shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea aye lighting from the boat to the deck thus i trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee a the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead foot a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over the mute motionless parsee s face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seaman clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted out to the brace up helm square in in an instant the yard swung round and a the ship half wheeled upon her heel her three firm seated graceful mast erectly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed a the three horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed standing between the knight head starbuck watched the pequod s tumultuous way and ahab s also a he went lurching along the deck i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of it tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust old man of ocean of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ash aye cried stubb but sea coal ash mind ye that mr starbuck sea coal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab mutter here some one thrust these card into these old hand of mine swears that i must play them and no others and damn me ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it chapter the candle warmest clime but nurse the cruellest fang the tiger of bengal crouch in spiced grove of ceaseless verdure sky the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunder gorgeous cuba know tornado that never swept tame northern land so too it is that in these resplendent japanese sea the mariner encounter the direst of all storm the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening of that day the pequod wa torn of her canvas and bare poled wa left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled mast fluttering here and there with the rag which the first fury of the tempest had left for it after sport holding by a shroud starbuck wa standing on the quarter deck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boat but all their pain seemed naught though lifted to the very top of the crane the windward quarter boat ahab s did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ship s high teetering side stove in the boat s bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck but the sea will have it way stubb for one can t fight it you see mr starbuck a wave ha such a great long start before it leap all round the world it run and then come the spring but a for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never mind it s all in fun so the old song say sings oh jolly is the gale and a joker is the whale a flourishin his tail such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh the scud all a flyin that s his flip only foamin when he stir in the spicin such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh thunder split the ship but he only smack his lip a tastin of this flip such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh avast stubb cried starbuck let the typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace but i am not a brave man never said i wa a brave man i am a coward and i sing to keep up my spirit and i tell you what it is mr starbuck there s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat and when that s done ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a wind up madman look through my eye if thou hast none of thine own what how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale come from the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove in the stern sheet man where he is wont to stand his stand point is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou must i don t half understand ye what s in the wind yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubb s question the gale that now hammer at u to stave u we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive u towards home yonder to windward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homeward i see it lightens up there but not with the lightning at that moment in one of the interval of profound darkness following the flash a voice wa heard at his side and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peal rolled overhead who s there old thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwark to his pivot hole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lance of fire now a the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ship carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but a this conductor must descend to considerable depth that it end may avoid all contact with the hull and a moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishap besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the vessel s way in the water because of all this the lower part of a ship s lightning rod are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender link so a to be the more readily hauled up into the chain outside or thrown down into the sea a occasion may require the rod the rod cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeau to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and aft quick avast cried ahab let s have fair play here though we be the weaker side yet i ll contribute to raise rod on the himmalehs and andes that all the world may be secured but out on privilege let them be sir look aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants all the yard arm were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each tri pointed lightning rod end with three tapering white flame each of the three tall mast wa silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax taper before an altar blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant a a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that it gunwale violently jammed his hand a he wa passing a lashing blast it but slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eye caught the flame and immediately shifting his tone he cried the corpusants have mercy on u all to sailor oath are household word they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curse from the topsail yard arm when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when god s burning finger ha been laid on the ship when his mene mene tekel upharsin ha been woven into the shroud and the cordage while this pallidness wa burning aloft few word were heard from the enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eye gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away constellation of star relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark white teeth which strangely gleamed a if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequeg s tattooing burned like satanic blue flame on his body the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the pequod and every soul on her deck were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it wa stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it wa not the same in the song no no it wasn t i said the corpusants have mercy on u all and i hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long face have they no bowel for a laugh and look ye mr starbuck but it s too dark to look hear me then i take that mast head flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those mast are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a block with sperm oil d ye see and so all that sperm will work up into the mast like sap in a tree yes our three mast will yet be a three spermaceti candle that s the good promise we saw at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once more the high tapering flame were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor the corpusants have mercy on u all cried stubb again at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee wa kneeling in ahab s front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seaman arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasp from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted attitude like the standing or stepping or running skeleton in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eye upcast aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white flame but light the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast link there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire so then turning the last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and high flung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tri pointed trinity of flame oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these sea i a persian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now know that thy right worship is defiance to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and e en for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed no fearless fool now front thee i own thy speechless placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute it unconditional unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the personified impersonal a personality stand here though but a point at best whencesoe er i came wheresoe er i go yet while i earthly live the queenly personality life in me and feel her royal right but war is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come a mere supernal power and though thou launchest navy of full freighted world there s that in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to thee sudden repeated flash of lightning the nine flame leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest close his eye his right hand pressed hard upon them i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor wa it wrung from me nor do i now drop these link thou canst blind but i can then grope thou canst consume but i can then be ash take the homage of these poor eye and shutter hand i would not take it the lightning flash through my skull mine eye ball ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems a beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee the javelin cease open eye see or not there burn the flame oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in my genealogy but thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not oh cruel what hast thou done with her there lie my puzzle but thine is greater thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through thee thy flaming self my scorched eye do dimly see it oh thou foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i read my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee the boat the boat cried starbuck look at thy boat old man ahab s harpoon the one forged at perth s fire remained firmly lashed in it conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whale boat s bow but the sea that had stove it bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire a the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent s tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the arm god god is against thee old man forbear ti an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yard while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this overhearing starbuck the panic stricken crew instantly ran to the brace though not a sail wa left aloft for the moment all the aghast mate s thought seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the rattling lightning link to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope s end petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke all your oath to hunt the white whale are a binding a mine and heart soul and body lung and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune this heart beat look ye here thus i blow out the last fear and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame a in the hurricane that sweep the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolt so at those last word of ahab s many of the mariner did run from him in a terror of dismay chapter the deck towards the end of the first night watch ahab standing by the helm starbuck approaching him we must send down the main top sail yard sir the band is working loose and the lee lift is half stranded shall i strike it sir strike nothing lash it if i had sky sail pole i d sway them up now sir in god s name sir well the anchor are working sir shall i get them inboard strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rise but it ha not got up to my table land yet quick and see to it by mast and keel he take me for the hunch backed skipper of some coasting smack send down my main top sail yard ho gluepots loftiest truck were made for wildest wind and this brain truck of mine now sail amid the cloud scud shall i strike that oh none but coward send down their brain truck in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft there i would e en take it for sublime did i not know that the colic is a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine chapter midnight the forecastle bulwark stubb and flask mounted on them and passing additional lashing over the anchor there hanging no stubb you may pound that knot there a much a you please but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary didn t you once say that whatever ship ahab sail in that ship should pay something extra on it insurance policy just a though it were loaded with powder barrel aft and box of lucifer forward stop now didn t you say so well suppose i did what then i ve part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind besides supposing we are loaded with powder barrel aft and lucifer forward how the devil could the lucifer get afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldn t get afire now shake yourself you re aquarius or the water bearer flask might fill pitcher at your coat collar don t you see then that for these extra risk the marine insurance company have extra guarantee here are hydrant flask but hark again and i ll answer ye the other thing first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pas the rope now listen what s the mighty difference between holding a mast s lightning rod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasn t got any lightning rod at all in a storm don t you see you timber head that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred carry rod and ahab aye man and all of u were in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crew in ten thousand ship now sailing the sea why you king post you i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning rod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officer s skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why don t ye be sensible flask it s easy to be sensible why don t ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible i don t know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard yes when a fellow s soaked through it s hard to be sensible that s a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the turn there and pas it seems to me we are lashing down these anchor now a if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchor here flask seems like tying a man s hand behind him and what big generous hand they are to be sure these are your iron fist hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swing with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and we ve done so next to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out my jacket skirt will ye thank ye they laugh at long togs so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storm afloat the tail tapering down that way serve to carry off the water d ye see same with cocked hat the cock form gable end eave trough flask no more monkey jacket and tarpaulin for me i must mount a swallow tail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew there go my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the wind that come from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad chapter midnight aloft thunder and lightning the main top sail yard tashtego passing new lashing around it um um um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here what s the use of thunder um um um we don t want thunder we want rum give u a glass of rum um um um chapter the musket during the most violent shock of the typhoon the man at the pequod s jaw bone tiller had several time been reelingly hurled to the deck by it spasmodic motion even though preventer tackle had been attached to it for they were slack because some play to the tiller wa indispensable in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no mean uncommon to see the needle in the compass at interval go round and round it wa thus with the pequod s at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the card it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion some hour after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertion of starbuck and stubb one engaged forward and the other aft the shivered remnant of the jib and fore and main top sail were cut adrift from the spar and went eddying away to leeward like the feather of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the wind when that storm tossed bird is on the wing the three corresponding new sail were now bent and reefed and a storm trysail wa set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the course for the present east south east which he wa to steer if practicable wa once more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to it vicissitude but a he wa now bringing the ship a near her course a possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair instantly the yard were squared to the lively song of ho the fair wind oh ye ho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portent preceding it in compliance with the standing order of his commander to report immediately and at any one of the twenty four hour any decided change in the affair of the deck starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yard to the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his state room he involuntarily paused before it a moment the cabin lamp taking long swing this way and that wa burning fitfully and casting fitful shadow upon the old man s bolted door a thin one with fixed blind inserted in place of upper panel the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it wa hooped round by all the roar of the element the loaded musket in the rack were shiningly revealed a they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck wa an honest upright man but out of starbuck s heart at that instant when he saw the musket there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with it neutral or good accompaniment that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself he would have shot me once he murmured yes there s the very musket that he pointed at me that one with the studded stock let me touch it lift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lance strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the pan that s not good best spill it wait i ll cure myself of this i ll hold the musket boldly while i think i come to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doom that s fair for moby dick it s a fair wind that s only fair for that accursed fish the very tube he pointed at me the very one this one i hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now aye and he would fain kill all his crew doe he not say he will not strike his spar to any gale ha he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous sea grope he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error abounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightning rod but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship s company down to doom with him yes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instant put aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in his sleep yes just there in there he s sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i can t withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat command this is all thou breathest aye and say st the men have vow d thy vow say st all of u are ahab great god forbid but is there no other way no lawful way make him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old man s living power from his own living hand only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with rope and hawser chained down to ring bolt on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the sight could not possibly fly his howling all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what then remains the land is hundred of league away and locked japan the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two ocean and a whole continent between me and law aye aye ti so is heaven a murderer when it lightning strike a would be murderer in his bed tindering sheet and skin together and would i be a murderer then if and slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded musket s end against the door on this level ahab s hammock swing within his head this way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again oh mary mary boy boy boy but if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deep starbuck s body this day week may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall i the wind ha gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsail are reefed and set she head her course stern all oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last such were the sound that now came hurtling from out the old man s tormented sleep a if starbuck s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard s arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the death tube in it rack and left the place he s too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him i must see to the deck here thou know st what to say chapter the needle next morning the not yet subsided sea rolled in long slow billow of mighty bulk and striving in the pequod s gurgling track pushed her on like giant palm outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sail the whole world boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun wa only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet ray moved on in stack emblazonings a of crowned babylonian king and queen reigned over everything the sea wa a a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leap with light and heat long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sun s ray produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the sun s rearward place and how the same yellow ray were blending with his undeviating wake ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the sea chariot of the sun ho ho all ye nation before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke on the further billow hallo a tandem i drive the sea but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship wa heading east sou east sir said the frightened steersman thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern upon this every soul wa confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but it very blinding palpableness must have been the cause thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compass his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two compass pointed east and the pequod wa a infallibly going west but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it ha happened before mr starbuck last night s thunder turned our compass that s all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it aye but never before ha it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily here it must need be said that accident like this have in more than one case occurred to ship in violent storm the magnetic energy a developed in the mariner s needle is a all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such thing should be instance where the lightning ha actually struck the vessel so a to smite down some of the spar and rigging the effect upon the needle ha at time been still more fatal all it loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel wa of no more use than an old wife s knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compass be affected the same fate reach all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compass the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needle were exactly inverted shouted out his order for the ship s course to be changed accordingly the yard were hard up and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bow into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her meanwhile whatever were his own secret thought starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite order while stubb and flask who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feeling likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced a for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab wa greater than their fear of fate but a ever before the pagan harpooneer remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it wa only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial heart from inflexible ahab s for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling revery but chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sight tube of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck thou poor proud heaven gazer and sun s pilot yesterday i wrecked thee and to day the compass would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbuck a lance without a pole a top maul and the smallest of the sail maker s needle quick accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he wa now about to do were certain prudential motif whose object might have been to revive the spirit of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous a that of the inverted compass besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needle though clumsily practicable wa not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailor without some shudderings and evil portent men said he steadily turning upon the crew a the mate handed him the thing he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahab s needle but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point a true a any abashed glance of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailor a this wa said and with fascinated eye they awaited whatever magic might follow but starbuck looked away with a blow from the top maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without it touching the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several time the mate still holding the rod a before then going through some small strange motion with it whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertain he called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needle there and horizontally suspended the sail needle by it middle over one of the compass card at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to it place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed look ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eye could persuade such ignorance a theirs and one after another they slunk away in his fiery eye of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride chapter the log and line while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance upon other mean of determining the vessel s place some merchantman and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for form s sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship a well a the presumed average rate of progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwark rain and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the element had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab a he happened to glance upon the reel not many hour after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant wa no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line the ship wa sailing plungingly astern the billow rolled in riot forward there heave the log two seaman came the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take the reel one of ye i ll heave they went towards the extreme stern on the ship s lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind wa now almost dipping into the creamy sidelong rushing sea the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handle end of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him ahab stood before him and wa lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turn to form a preliminary hand coil to toss overboard when the old manxman who wa intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak sir i mistrust it this line look far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee thou seem st to hold or truer perhaps life hold thee not thou it i hold the spool sir but just a my captain say with these grey hair of mine ti not worth while disputing specially with a superior who ll ne er confess what s that there now s a patched professor in queen nature s granite founded college but methinks he s too subservient where wert thou born in the little rocky isle of man sir excellent thou st hit the world by that i know not sir but i wa born there in the isle of man hey well the other way it s good here s a man from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man which is sucked in by what up with the reel the dead blind wall butt all inquiring head at last up with it so the log wa heaved the loose coil rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billow the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely hold hard snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging log wa gone i crush the quadrant the thunder turn the needle and now the mad sea part the log line but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line see to it there he go now to him nothing s happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in tahitian these line run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whale boat pip s missing let s see now if ye haven t fished him up here fisherman it drag hard i guess he s holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul in no coward here ho there s his arm just breaking water a hatchet a hatchet cut it off we haul in no coward here captain ahab sir sir here s pip trying to get on board again peace thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm away from the quarter deck the greater idiot ever scold the lesser muttered ahab advancing hand off from that holiness where sayest thou pip wa boy astern there sir astern lo lo and who art thou boy i see not my reflection in the vacant pupil of thy eye oh god that man should be a thing for immortal soul to sieve through who art thou boy bell boy sir ship s crier ding dong ding pip pip pip one hundred pound of clay reward for pip five foot high look cowardly quickest known

not what he doe yet full of the sweet thing of love and gratitude come i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an emperor s there go two daft one now muttered the old manxman one daft with strength the other daft with weakness but here s the end of the rotten line all dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new line altogether i ll see mr stubb about it chapter the life buoy steering now south eastward by ahab s levelled steel and her progress solely determined by ahab s level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such unfrequented water descrying no ship and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade wind over wave monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm thing preluding some riotous and desperate scene at last when the ship drew near to the outskirt a it were of the equatorial fishing ground and in the deep darkness that go before the dawn wa sailing by a cluster of rocky islet the watch then headed by flask wa startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly like half articulated wailing of the ghost of all herod s murdered innocent that one and all they started from their revery and for the space of some moment stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it wa mermaid and shuddered but the pagan harpooneer remained unappalled yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner of all declared that the wild thrilling sound that were heard were the voice of newly drowned men in the sea below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it wa then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meaning he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder those rocky island the ship had passed were the resort of great number of seal and some young seal that had lost their dam or some dam that had lost their cub must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her cry and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them because most mariner cherish a very superstitious feeling about seal arising not only from their peculiar tone when in distress but also from the human look of their round head and semi intelligent face seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstance seal have more than once been mistaken for men but the boding of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sun rise this man went from his hammock to his mast head at the fore and whether it wa that he wa not yet half waked from his sleep for sailor sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it wa thus with the man there is now no telling but be that a it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry wa heard a cry and a rushing and looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubble in the blue of the sea the life buoy a long slender cask wa dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at it every pore and the studded iron bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom a if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whale s own peculiar ground that man wa swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least a a portent for they regarded it not a a foreshadowing of evil in the future but a the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shriek they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay the lost life buoy wa now to be replaced starbuck wa directed to see to it but a no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and a in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hand were impatient of any toil but what wa directly connected with it final end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ship s stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange sign and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin a life buoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting rather queer that i should say said stubb it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can arrange it easily bring it up there s nothing else for it said starbuck after a melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me so the coffin i mean dost thou hear me rig it and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand a with a hammer aye and shall i caulk the seam sir moving his hand a with a caulking iron aye and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand a with a pitch pot away what possesses thee to this make a life buoy of the coffin and no more mr stubb mr flask come forward with me he go off in a huff the whole he can endure at the part he baulk now i don t like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wear it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he won t put his head into it are all my pain to go for nothing with that coffin and now i m ordered to make a life buoy of it it s like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i don t like this cobbling sort of business i don t like it at all it s undignified it s not my place let tinker brat do tinkerings we are their better i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair and square mathematical job something that regularly begin at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and come to an end at the conclusion not a cobbler s job that s at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end it s the old woman s trick to be giving cobbling job lord what an affection all old woman have for tinker i know an old woman of sixty five who ran away with a bald headed young tinker once and that s the reason i never would work for lonely widow old woman ashore when i kept my job shop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their lonely old head to run off with me but heigh ho there are no cap at sea but snow cap let me see nail down the lid caulk the seam pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snap spring over the ship s stern were ever such thing done before with a coffin some superstitious old carpenter now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job but i m made of knotty aroostook hemlock i don t budge cruppered with a coffin sailing about with a grave yard tray but never mind we worker in wood make bridal bedstead and card table a well a coffin and hearse we work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for u to ask the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can hem i ll do the job now tenderly i ll have me let s see how many in the ship s company all told but i ve forgotten any way i ll have me thirty separate turk s headed life line each three foot long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go down there ll be thirty lively fellow all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer caulking iron pitch pot and marling spike let s to it chapter the deck the coffin laid upon two line tub between the vice bench and the open hatchway the carpenter caulking it seam the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock ahab come slowly from the cabin gangway and hears pip following him back lad i will be with ye again presently he go not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy middle aisle of a church what s here life buoy sir mr starbuck s order oh look sir beware the hatchway thank ye man thy coffin lie handy to the vault sir the hatchway oh so it doe sir so it doe art not thou the leg maker look did not this stump come from thy shop i believe it did sir doe the ferrule stand sir well enough but art thou not also the undertaker aye sir i patched up this thing here a a coffin for queequeg but they ve set me now to turning it into something else then tell me art thou not an arrant all grasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making leg and the next day coffin to clap them in and yet again life buoy out of those same coffin thou art a unprincipled a the god and a much of a jack of all trade but i do not mean anything sir i do a i do the god again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin the titan they say hummed snatch when chipping out the crater for volcano and the grave digger in the play sings spade in hand dost thou never sing sir do i sing oh i m indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the grave digger made music must have been because there wa none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark to it aye and that s because the lid there s a sounding board and what in all thing make the sounding board is this there s naught beneath and yet a coffin with a body in it ring pretty much the same carpenter hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in faith sir i ve faith what s that why faith sir it s only a sort of exclamation like that s all sir um um go on i wa about to say sir that art thou a silk worm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself look at thy bosom despatch and get these trap out of sight he go aft that wa sudden now but squall come sudden in hot latitude i ve heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of equator cut yon old man too right in his middle he s always under the line fiery hot i tell ye he s looking this way come oakum quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and i m the professor of musical glass tap tap ahab to himself there s a sight there s a sound the greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that thing rest on two line tub full of tow line a most malicious wag that fellow rat tat so man s second tick oh how immaterial are all material what thing real are there but imponderable thought here now s the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life a life buoy of a coffin doe it go further can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortality preserver i ll think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth that it other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return again now then pip we ll talk this over i do suck most wondrous philosophy from thee some unknown conduit from the unknown world must empty into thee chapter the pequod meet the rachel next day a large ship the rachel wa descried bearing directly down upon the pequod all her spar thickly clustering with men at the time the pequod wa making good speed through the water but a the broad winged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sail all fell together a blank bladder that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull bad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail ahab s voice wa heard hast seen the white whale aye yesterday have ye seen a whale boat adrift throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessel s way wa seen descending her side a few keen pull and his boat hook soon clinched the pequod s main chain and he sprang to the deck immediately he wa recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation wa exchanged where wa he not killed not killed cried ahab closely advancing how wa it it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the stranger s boat were engaged with a shoal of whale which had led them some four or five mile from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boat a reserved one had been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat the swiftest keeled of all seemed to have succeeded in fastening at least a well a the man at the mast head could tell anything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it wa concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuer a often happens there wa some apprehension but no positive alarm a yet the recall signal were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boat ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to it fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sail stunsail on stunsail after the missing boat kindling a fire in her try pot for a beacon and every other man aloft on the look out but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent one when last seen though she then paused to lower her spare boat to pull all around her and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boat and though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five mile apart on parallel line and so sweeping a double horizon a it were i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one in that missing boat wore off that captain s best coat mayhap his watch he s so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two pious whale ship cruising after one missing whale boat in the height of the whaling season see flask only see how pale he look pale in the very button of his eye look it wasn t the coat it must have been the my boy my own boy is among them for god s sake i beg i conjure here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition for eight and forty hour let me charter your ship i will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for it if there be no other way for eight and forty hour only only that you must oh you must and you shall do this thing his son cried stubb oh it s his son he s lost i take back the coat and watch what say ahab we must save that boy he s drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manx sailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirit now a it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachel s the more melancholy wa the circumstance that not only wa one of the captain s son among the number of the missing boat s crew but among the number of the other boat s crew at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitude of the chase there had been still another son a that for a time the wretched father wa plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which wa only solved for him by his chief mate s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale ship in such emergency that is when placed between jeopardized but divided boat always to pick up the majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by ahab s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve year old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer s paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the peril and wonder of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor doe it unfrequently occur that nantucket captain will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four year voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whaleman s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father s natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern meantime now the stranger wa still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own i will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to me a you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy captain ahab though but a child and nestling safely at home now a child of your old age too yes yes you relent i see it run run men now and stand by to square in the yard avast cried ahab touch not a rope yarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word captain gardiner i will not do it even now i lose time good bye good bye god bless ye man and may i forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minute from this present instant warn off all stranger then brace forward again and let the ship sail a before hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship soon the two ship diverged their wake and long a the strange vessel wa in view she wa seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea this way and that her yard were swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her mast and yard were thickly clustered with men a three tall cherry tree when the boy are cherrying among the bough but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort she wa rachel weeping for her child because they were not chapter the cabin ahab moving to go on deck pip catch him by the hand to follow lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too curing to my malady like cure like and for this hunt my malady becomes my most desired health do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee a if thou wert the captain aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair another screw to it thou must be no no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye

living skin but i will never desert ye sir a stubb did him sir i must go with ye if thou speakest thus to me much more ahab s purpose keel up in him i tell thee no it can not be oh good master master

name shame upon them put one foot upon the table shame upon all coward hist above there i hear ivory oh master master i am indeed down hearted when you walk over me but here i ll stay though this stern strike rock and they bulge through and oyster come to join me chapter the hat and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahab all other whaling water swept seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean fold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick and now that all his successive meeting with various ship contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunter whether sinning or sinned against now it wa that there lurked a something in the old man s eye which it wa hardly sufferable for feeble soul to see a the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six month night sustains it piercing steady central gaze so ahab s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their boding doubt misgiving fear were fain to hide beneath their soul and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahab s iron soul like machine they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old man s despot eye wa on them but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hour when he thought no glance but one wa on him then you would have seen that even a ahab s eye so awed the crew s the inscrutable parsee s glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at time affected it such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain a it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being s body and that shadow wa always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand still for hour but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eye did plainly say we two watchman never rest nor at any time by night or day could the mariner now step upon the deck unless ahab wa before them either standing in his pivot hole or exactly pacing the plank between two undeviating limit the main mast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabin scuttle his living foot advanced upon the deck a if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eye so that however motionless he stood however the day and night were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eye were really closed at time or whether he wa still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night damp gathered in bead of dew upon that stone carved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the next day s sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the plank whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for he ate in the same open air that is his two only meal breakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled a unearthed root of tree blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life wa now become one watch on deck and though the parsee s mystic watch wa without intermission a his own yet these two never seemed to speak one man to the other unless at long interval some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awe struck crew they seemed pole like asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far a concerned the slightest verbal interchange at time for longest hour without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other a if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance and yet somehow did ahab in his own proper self a daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinate ahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel wa solid ahab at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice wa heard from aft man the mast head and all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsman s bell wa heard what d ye see sharp sharp but when three or four day had slided by after meeting the child seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew s fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneer he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if these suspicion were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his action might seem to hint them i will have the first sight of the whale myself he said aye ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hand he rigged a nest of basketed bowline and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the main mast head he received the two end of the downward reeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate said take the rope sir i give it into thy hand starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for mile and mile ahead astern this side and that within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height when in working with his hand at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chance to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstance it fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who ha the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relation aloft can not always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deck end of these rope are being every few minute cast down from the fastening it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahab s proceeding in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision one of those too whose faithfulness on the look out he had seemed to doubt somewhat it wa strange that this wa the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person s hand now the first time ahab wa perched aloft ere he had been there ten minute one of those red billed savage sea hawk which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast head of whalemen in these latitude one of these bird came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand foot straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizen mast head stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them but already the sable wing wa before the old man s eye the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize an eagle flew thrice round tarquin s head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap wa that omen accounted good ahab s hat wa never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot wa dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea chapter the pequod meet the delight the intense pequod sailed on the rolling wave and day went by the life buoy coffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the delight wa descried a she drew nigh all eye were fixed upon her broad beam called shear which in some whaling ship cross the quarter deck at the height of eight or nine foot serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boat upon the stranger s shear were beheld the shattered white rib and some few splintered plank of what had once been a whale boat but you now saw through this wreck a plainly a you see through the peeled half unhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse hast seen the white whale look replied the hollow cheeked captain from his taffrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck hast killed him the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered side some noiseless sailor were busy in sewing together not forged and snatching perth s levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out exclaiming look ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barb and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the white whale most feel his accursed life then god keep thee old man see st thou that pointing to the hammock i bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his crew are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so then oh god advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hand may the resurrection and the life brace forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men but the suddenly started pequod wa not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made a it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubble might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism a ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange life buoy hanging at the pequod s stern came into conspicuous relief ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake in vain oh ye stranger ye fly our sad burial ye but turn u your taffrail to show u your coffin chapter the symphony it wa a clear steel blue day the firmament of air and sea were hardly separable in that all pervading azure only the pensive air wa transparently pure and soft with a woman s look and the robust and man like sea heaved with long strong lingering swell a samson s chest in his sleep hither and thither on high glided the snow white wing of small unspeckled bird these were the gentle thought of the feminine air but to and fro in the deep far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathan sword fish and shark and these were the strong troubled murderous thinking of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting within the contrast wa only in shade and shadow without those two seemed one it wa only the sex a it were that distinguished them aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even a bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motion most seen here at the equator denoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarm with which the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkle haggardly firm and unyielding his eye glowing like coal that still glow in the ash of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl s forehead of heaven oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged creature that frolic all round u sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old ahab s close coiled woe but so have i seen little miriam and martha laughing eyed elf heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed lock which grew on the marge of that burnt out crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aroma in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the step mother world so long cruel forbidding now threw affectionate arm round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him a if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the pacific contain such wealth a that one wee drop starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there ahab turned starbuck sir oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such a day very much such a sweetness a this i struck my first whale a boy harpooneer of eighteen forty forty forty year ago ago forty year of continual whaling forty year of privation and peril and storm time forty year on the pitiless sea for forty year ha ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty year to make war on the horror of the deep aye and yes starbuck out of those forty year i have not spent three ashore when i think of this life i have led the desolation of solitude it ha been the masoned walled town of a captain s exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without oh weariness heaviness guinea coast slavery of solitary command when i think of all this only half suspected not so keenly known to me before and how for forty year i have fed upon dry salted fare fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil when the poorest landsman ha had fresh fruit to his daily hand and broken the world s fresh bread to my mouldy crust away whole ocean away from that young girl wife i wedded past fifty and sailed for cape horn the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow wife wife rather a widow with her husband alive aye i widowed that poor girl when i married her starbuck and then the madness the frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowering old ahab ha furiously foamingly chased his prey more a demon than a man aye aye what a forty year fool fool old fool ha old ahab been why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or better is ahab now behold oh starbuck is it not hard that with this weary load i bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under me here brush this old hair aside it blind me that i seem to weep lock so grey did never grow but from out some ash but do i look very old so very very old starbuck i feel deadly faint bowed and humped a though i were adam staggering beneath the piled century since paradise god god god crack my heart stave my brain mockery mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hair have i lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old close stand close to me starbuck let me look into a human eye it is better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon god by the green land by the bright hearth stone this is the magic glass man i see my wife and my child in thine eye no no stay on board on board lower not when i do when branded ahab give chase to moby dick that hazard shall not be thine no no not with the far away home i see in that eye oh my captain my captain noble soul grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hated fish away with me let u fly these deadly water let u home wife and child too are starbuck s wife and child of his brotherly sisterly play fellow youth even a thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let u away this instant let me alter the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have some such mild blue day even a this in nantucket they have they have i have seen them some summer day in the morning about this time yes it is his noon nap now the boy vivaciously wake sits up in bed and his mother tell him of me of cannibal old me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again ti my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father s sail yes yes no more it is done we head for nantucket come my captain study out the course and let u away see see the boy s face from the window the boy s hand on the hill but ahab s glance wa averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor command me that against all natural lovings and longing i so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not so much a dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lift this arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is a an errand boy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thought unless god doe that beating doe that thinking doe that living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea look see yon albicore who put it into him to chase and fang that flying fish where do murderer go man who s to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the air smell now a if it blew from a far away meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slope of the andes starbuck and the mower are sleeping among the new mown hay sleeping aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid greenness a last year s scythe flung down and left in the half cut swath starbuck but blanched to a corpse s hue with despair the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eye in the water there fedallah wa motionlessly leaning over the same rail chapter the chase first day that night in the mid watch when the old man a his wont at interval stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivot hole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air a a sagacious ship s dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale wa palpable to all the watch nor wa any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dog vane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor a nearly a possible ahab rapidly ordered the ship s course to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened the acute policy dictating these movement wa sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth a oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkle bordering it the polished metallic like mark of some swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream man the mast head call all hand thundering with the butt of three clubbed handspike on the forecastle deck daggoo roused the sleeper with such judgment clap that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hand what d ye see cried ahab flattening his face to the sky nothing nothing sir wa the sound hailing down in reply t gallant sail stunsails alow and aloft and on both side all sail being set he now cast loose the life line reserved for swaying him to the main royal mast head and in a few moment they were hoisting him thither when while but two third of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main top sail and top gallant sail he raised a gull like cry in the air there she blow there she blow a hump like a snow hill it is moby dick fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look out the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his final perch some foot above the other look out tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top gallant mast so that the indian s head wa almost on a level with ahab s heel from this height the whale wa now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariner it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian ocean and did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the perched men all around him i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i cried out said tashtego not the same instant not the same no the doubloon is mine fate reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised the white whale first there she blow there she blow there she blow there again there again he cried in long drawn lingering methodic tone attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale s visible jet he s going to sound in stunsails down top gallant sail stand by three boat mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go fluke no no only black water all ready the boat there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lower quick quicker and he slid through the air to the deck he is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb right away from u can not have seen the ship yet be dumb man stand by the brace hard down the helm brace up shiver her shiver her so well that boat boat soon all the boat but starbuck s were dropped all the boat sail set all the paddle plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale death glimmer lit up fedallah s sunken eye a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shell their light prow sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe a they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over it wave seemed a noon meadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump wa distinctly visible sliding along the sea a if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkle of the slightly projecting head beyond before it far out on the soft turkish rugged water went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue water interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubble arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light toe of hundred of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to some flag staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale s back and at interval one of the cloud of soft toed fowl hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feather streaming like pennon a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horn his lovely leering eye sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme did surpass the glorified white whale a he so divinely swam on each soft side coincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide away on each bright side the whale shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunter who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornado yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou may st have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus through the serene tranquillity of the tropical sea among wave whose hand clapping were suspended by exceeding rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terror of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginia s natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered fluke in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white sea fowl longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left with oar apeak and paddle down the sheet of their sail adrift the three boat now stilly floated awaiting moby dick s reappearance an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boat s stern and he gazed beyond the whale s place towards the dim blue space and wide wooing vacancy to leeward it wa only an instant for again his eye seemed whirling round in his head a he swept the watery circle the breeze now freshened the sea began to swell the bird the bird cried tashtego in long indian file a when heron take wing the white bird were now all flying towards ahab s boat and when within a few yard began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cry their vision wa keener than man s ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly a he peered down and down into it depth he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying a it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked row of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom it wa moby dick s open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open doored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon fedallah to change place with him went forward to the bow and seizing perth s harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oar and stand by to stern now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon it axis it bow by anticipation wa made to face the whale s head while yet under water but a if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself a it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking it bow full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a row lock the bluish pearl white of the inside of the jaw wa within six inch of ahab s head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar a a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eye fedallah gazed and crossed his arm but the tiger yellow crew were tumbling over each other s head to gain the uttermost stern and now while both elastic gunwale were springing in and out a the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bow for the bow were almost inside of him a it were and while the other boat involuntarily paused a before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it wa that monomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaw he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hand and wildly strove to wrench it from it gripe a now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwale bent in collapsed and snapped a both jaw like an enormous shear sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wreck these floated aside the broken end drooping the crew at the stern wreck clinging to the gunwale and striving to hold fast to the oar to lash them across at that preluding moment ere the boat wa yet snapped ahab the first to perceive the whale s intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the whale s mouth and tilting over sideways a it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it a he leaned to the push and so he fell flat faced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billow and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more foot out of the water the now rising swell with all their confluent wave dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel billow only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap it summit with their scud this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives it designation pitchpoling from it being likened to that preliminary up and down poise of the whale lance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever object may be encircling him but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake a if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him a the blood of grape and mulberry cast before antiochus s elephant in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale s insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim though he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool a that helpless ahab s head wa seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the boat s fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him more than enough wa it for them to look to themselves for so revolvingly appalling wa the white whale s aspect and so planetarily swift the ever contracting circle he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boat unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaway ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eye then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old man s head meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship s mast head and squaring her yard she had borne down upon the scene and wa now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed her sail on the but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shouted sail on the whale drive him off the pequod s prow were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim a he sullenly swam off the boat flew to the rescue dragged into stubb s boat with blood shot blinded eye the white brine caking in his wrinkle the long tension of ahab s bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his body s doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb s boat like one trodden under foot of herd of elephant far inland nameless wail came from him a desolate sound from out ravine but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it in an instant s compass great heart sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pain kindly diffused through feebler men s whole life and so such heart though summary in each one suffering still if the god decree it in their life time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensity for even in their pointless centre those noble nature contain the entire circumference of inferior soul the harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one bended arm is it safe aye sir for it wa not darted this is it said stubb showing it lay it before me any missing men one two three four five there were five oar sir and here are five men that s good help me man i wish to stand so so i see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spout hand off from me the eternal sap run up in ahab s bone again set the sail out oar the helm it is often the case that when a boat is stove it crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called double banked oar it wa thus now but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed to have treble banked his every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstance pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself then a it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate mean of overtaking the chase accordingly the boat now made for her and were soon swayed up to their crane the two part of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her and then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it with stun sail like the double jointed wing of an albatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby dick at the well known methodic interval the whale s glittering spout wa regularly announced from the manned mast head and when he would be reported a just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnacle watch in hand so soon a the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice wa heard whose is the doubloon now d ye see him and if the reply wa no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the plank a he wa thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadth thus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarter deck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and a in an already over clouded sky fresh troop of cloud will sometimes sail across so over the old man s face there now stole some such added gloom a this stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his captain s mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimed the thistle the as refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha what soulless thing is this that laugh before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave a fearless fire and a mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck aye sir said starbuck drawing near ti a solemn sight an omen and an ill one omen omen the dictionary if the god think to speak outright to man they will honorably speak outright not shake their head and give an old wife darkling hint begone ye two are the opposite pole of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab stand alone among the million of the peopled earth nor god nor men his neighbor cold cold i shiver how now aloft there d ye see him sing out for every spout though he spout ten time a second the day wa nearly done only the hem of his golden robe wa rustling soon it wa almost dark but the look out men still remained unset can t see the spout now sir too dark cried a voice from the air how heading when last seen a before sir straight to leeward good he will travel slower now ti night down royal and top gallant stun sail mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning he s making a passage now and may heave to a while helm there keep her full before the wind aloft come down mr stubb send a fresh hand to the fore mast head and see it manned till morning then advancing towards the doubloon in the main mast men this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye first raise him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that man s and if on that day i shall again raise him then ten time it sum shall be divided among all of ye away now the deck is thine sir and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at interval rousing himself to see how the night wore on chapter the chase second day at day break the three mast head were punctually manned afresh d ye see him cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread see nothing sir turn up all hand and make sail he travel faster than i thought for the top gallant sail aye they should have been kept on her all night but no matter ti but resting for the rush here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no mean unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural genius among the nantucket commander that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstance pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of sight a well a his probable rate of progression during that period and in these case somewhat a a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well know and which he desire shortly to return to again but at some further point like a this pilot stand by his compass and take the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so doe the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hour of daylight then when night obscures the fish the creature s future wake through the darkness is almost a established to the sagacious mind of the hunter a the pilot s coast is to him so that to this hunter s wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purpose well nigh a reliable a the steadfast land and a the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in it every pace that with watch in their hand men time his rate a doctor that of a baby s pulse and lightly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasion when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hour hence this whale will have gone two hundred mile will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whaleman s ally for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety three league and a quarter from his port inferable from these statement are many collateral subtile matter touching the chase of whale the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea a when a cannon ball missent becomes a plough share and turn up the level field by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deck creep up one s leg and tingle at the heart this ship and i are two brave fellow ha ha some one take me up and launch me spine wise on the sea for by live oak my spine s a keel ha ha we go the gait that leaf no dust behind there she blow she blow she blow right ahead wa now the mast head cry aye aye cried stubb i knew it ye can t escape blow on and split your spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trump blister your lung ahab will dam off your blood a a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzy of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine worked anew whatever pale fear and foreboding some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all side routed a timid prairie hare that scatter before the bounding bison the hand of fate had snatched all their soul and by the stirring peril of the previous day the rack of the past night s suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards it flying mark by all these thing their heart were bowled along the wind that made great belly of their sail and rushed the vessel on by arm invisible a irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race they were one man not thirty for a the one ship that held them all though it wa put together of all contrasting thing oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on it way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individuality of the crew this man s valor that man s fear guilt and guiltiness all variety were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to the rigging lived the mast head like the top of tall palm were outspreadingly tufted with arm and leg clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient waving others shading their eye from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yard all the spar in full bearing of mortal ready and ripe for their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after the lapse of some minute since the first cry no more had been heard sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick cast one odd jet that way and then disappears it wa even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale spout a the event itself soon proved for hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly wa the rope belayed to it pin on deck when he struck the key note to an orchestra that made the air vibrate a with the combined discharge of rifle the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lung wa heard a much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead moby dick bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depth the sperm whale thus boom his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam show his place to the distance of seven mile and more in those moment the torn enraged wave he shake off seem his mane in some case this breaching is his act of defiance there she breach there she breach wa the cry a in his immeasurable bravado the white whale tossed himself salmon like to heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from it first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale aye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand down down all of ye but one man at the fore the boat stand by unmindful of the tedious rope ladder of the shroud the men like shooting star slid to the deck by the isolated backstay and halyard while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly wa dropped from his perch lower away he cried so soon a he had reached his boat a spare one rigged the afternoon previous mr starbuck the ship is thine keep away from the boat but keep near them lower all a if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself moby dick had turned and wa now coming for the three crew ahab s boat wa central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale head and head that is pull straight up to his forehead a not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale s sidelong vision but ere that close limit wa gained and while yet all three boat were plain a the ship s three mast to his eye the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an instant a it were rushing among the boat with open jaw and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the iron darted at him from every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boat were made but skilfully man uvred incessantly wheeling like trained charger in the field the boat for a while eluded him though at time but by a plank s breadth while all the time ahab s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shred but at last in his untraceable evolution the white whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand way entangled the slack of the three line now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boat towards the planted iron in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little a if to rally for a more tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more line and then wa rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarl when lo a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of shark caught and twisted corkscrewed in the maze of the line loose harpoon and lance with all their bristling barb and point came flashing and dripping up to the chock in the bow of ahab s boat only one thing could be done seizing the boat knife he critically reached within through and then without the ray of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chock dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and wa all fast again that instant the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangle of the other line by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boat of stubb and flask towards his fluke dashed them together like two rolling husk on a surf beaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chip of the wreck danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch while the two crew were yet circling in the water reaching out after the revolving line tub oar and other floating furniture while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his leg upwards to escape the dreaded jaw of shark and stubb wa lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old man s line now parting admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted peril ahab s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wire a arrow like shooting perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against it bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell again gunwale downwards and ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seal from a sea side cave the first uprising momentum of the whale modifying it direction a he struck the surface involuntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his fluke from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boat touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea but soon a if satisfied that his work for that time wa done he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled line continued his leeward way at a traveller s methodic pace a before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariner tub oar and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her deck some sprained shoulder wrist and ankle livid contusion wrenched harpoon and lance inextricable intricacy of rope shattered oar and plank all these were there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one a with fedallah the day before so ahab wa now found grimly clinging to his boat s broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him a the previous day s mishap but when he wa helped to the deck all eye were fastened upon him a instead of standing by himself he still half hung upon the shoulder of starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter aye aye starbuck ti sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he ha the ferrule ha not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up i put good work into that leg but no bone broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern aye and all splintered to piece stubb d ye see it but even with a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i account no living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one that s lost nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much a graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape yonder roof aloft there which way dead to leeward sir up helm then pile on the sail again ship keeper down the rest of the spare boat and rig them mr starbuck away and muster the boat s crew let me first help thee towards the bulwark sir oh oh oh how this splinter gore me now accursed fate that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate sir my body man not thee give me something for a cane there that shivered lance will do muster the men surely i have not seen him yet by heaven it can not be missing quick call them all the old man s hinted thought wa true upon mustering the company the parsee wa not there the parsee cried stubb he must have been caught in the black vomit wrench thee run all of ye above alow cabin forecastle find him not gone not gone but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee wa nowhere to be found aye sir said stubb caught among the tangle of your line i thought i saw him dragging under my line my line gone gone what mean that little word what death knell ring in it that old ahab shake a if he were the belfry the harpoon too toss over the litter there d ye see it the forged iron men the white whale s no no no blistered fool this hand did dart it ti in the fish aloft there keep him nailed quick all hand to the rigging of the boat collect the oar harpooneer the iron the iron hoist the royal higher a pull on all the sheet helm there steady steady for your life i ll ten time girdle the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through it but i ll slay him yet great god but for one single instant show thyself cried starbuck never never wilt thou capture him old man in jesus name no more of this that s worse than devil s madness two day chased twice stove to splinter thy very leg once more snatched from under thee thy evil shadow gone all good angel mobbing thee with warning what more wouldst thou have shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamp the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh oh impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more starbuck of late i ve felt strangely moved to thee ever since that hour we both saw thou know st what in one another s eye but in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me a the palm of this hand a lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this whole act s immutably decreed twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion year before this ocean rolled fool i am the fate lieutenant i act under order look thou underling that thou obeyest mine stand round me men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot ti ahab his body s part but ahab s soul s a centipede that move upon a hundred leg i feel strained half stranded a rope that tow dismasted frigate in a gale and i may look so but ere i break ye ll hear me crack and till ye hear that know that ahab s hawser tow his purpose yet believe ye men in the thing called omen then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they drown drowning thing will twice rise to the surface then rise again to sink for evermore so with moby dick two day he s floated tomorrow will be the third aye men he ll rise once more but only to spout his last d ye feel brave men brave a fearless fire cried stubb and a mechanical muttered ahab then a the men went forward he muttered on the thing called omen and yesterday i talked the same to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantly i seek to drive out of others heart what s clinched so fast in mine the parsee the parsee gone gone and he wa to go before but still wa to be seen again ere i could perish how s that there s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyer backed by the ghost of the whole line of judge like a hawk s beak it peck my brain i ll i ll solve it though when dusk descended the whale wa still in sight to leeward so once more the sail wa shortened and everything passed nearly a on the previous night only the sound of hammer and the hum of the grindstone wa heard till nearly daylight a the men toiled by lantern in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boat and sharpening their fresh weapon for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of ahab s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still a on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on it dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun chapter the chase third day the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary night man at the fore mast head wa relieved by crowd of the daylight look out who dotted every mast and almost every spar d ye see him cried ahab but the whale wa not yet in sight in his infallible wake though but follow that wake that s all helm there steady a thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a new made world and made for a summer house to the angel and this morning the first of it throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world here s food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never think he only feel feel feel that s tingling enough for mortal man to think s audacity god only ha that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor heart throb and our poor brain beat too much for that and yet i ve sometimes thought my brain wa very calm frozen calm this old skull crack so like a glass in which the content turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no it s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy cleft of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild wind blow it they whip it about me a the torn shred of split sail lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that ha no doubt blown ere this through prison corridor and cell and ward of hospital and ventilated them and now come blowing hither a innocent a fleece out upon it it s tainted were i the wind i d blow no more on such a wicked miserable world i d crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet ti a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight it ha the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that strike stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thing a nobler thing than that would now the wind but had a body but all the thing that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these thing are bodiless but only bodiless a object not a agent there s a most special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i say again and swear it now that there s something all glorious and gracious in the wind these warm trade wind at least that in the clear heaven blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser current of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal pole these same trade that so directly blow my good ship on these trade or something like them something so unchangeable and full a strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what d ye see nothing sir nothing and noon at hand the doubloon go a begging see the sun aye aye it must be so i ve oversailed him how got the start aye he s chasing me now not i him that s bad i might have known it too fool the line the harpoon he s towing aye aye i have run him by last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look out man the brace steering a she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequod s quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze a she rechurned the cream in her own white wake against the wind he now steer for the open jaw murmured starbuck to himself a he coiled the new hauled main brace upon the rail god keep u but already my bone feel damp within me and from the inside wet my flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him stand by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket we should meet him soon aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahab s bidding and once more ahab swung on high a whole hour now passed gold beaten out to age time itself now held long breath with keen suspense but at last some three point off the weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mast head three shriek went up a if the tongue of fire had voiced it forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck there brace sharper up crowd her into the wind s eye he s too far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sail shake stand over that helmsman with a top maul so so he travel fast and i must down but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there s time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sand hill of nantucket the same the same the same to noah a to me there s a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead somewhere to something else than common land more palmy than the palm leeward the white whale go that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old mast head what s this green aye tiny moss in these warped crack no such green weather stain on ahab s head there s the difference now between man s old age and matter s but aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hull though are we not my ship aye minus a leg that s all by heaven this dead wood ha the better of my live flesh every way i can t compare with it and i ve known some ship made of dead tree outlast the life of men made of the most vital stuff of vital father what s that he said he should still go before me my pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eye at the bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stair and all night i ve been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou told st direful truth a touching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short good bye mast head keep a good eye upon the whale the while i m gone we ll talk to morrow nay to night when the white whale lie down there tied by head and tail he gave the word and still gazing round him wa steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck in due time the boat were lowered but a standing in his shallop s stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the mate who held one of the tackle rope on deck and bade him pause starbuck sir for the third time my soul s ship start upon this voyage starbuck aye sir thou wilt have it so some ship sail from their port and ever afterwards are missing starbuck truth sir saddest truth some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of the flood and i feel now like a billow that s all one crested comb starbuck i am old shake hand with me man their hand met their eye fastened starbuck s tear the glue oh my captain my captain noble heart go not go not see it s a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then lower away cried ahab tossing the mate s arm from him stand by the crew in an instant the boat wa pulling round close under the stern the shark the shark cried a voice from the low cabin window there o master my master come back but ahab heard nothing for his own voice wa high lifted then and the boat leaped on yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when number of shark seemingly rising from out the dark water beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blade of the oar every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bite it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale boat in those swarming sea the shark at time apparently following them in the same prescient way that vulture hover over the banner of marching regiment in the east but these were the first shark that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried and whether it wa that ahab s crew were all such tiger yellow barbarian and therefore their flesh more musky to the sens of the shark a matter sometimes well known to affect them however it wa they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eye the receding boat canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight lowering thy keel among ravening shark and followed by them open mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day for when three day flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thing be that end what it may oh my god what is this that shoot through me and leaf me so deadly calm yet expectant fixed at the top of a shudder future thing swim before me a in empty outline and skeleton all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl thou fadest in pale glory behind me boy i seem to see but thy eye grown wondrous blue strangest problem of life seem clearing but cloud sweep between is my journey s end coming my leg feel faint like his who ha footed it all day feel thy heart beat it yet stir thyself starbuck stave it off move move speak aloud mast head there see ye my boy s hand on the hill crazed aloft there keep thy keenest eye upon the boat mark well the whale ho again drive off that hawk see he peck he tear the vane pointing to the red flag flying at the main truck ha he soar away with it where s the old man now see st thou that sight oh ahab shudder shudder the boat had not gone very far when by a signal from the mast head a downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence a the head beat wave hammered and hammered against the opposing bow drive drive in your nail oh ye wave to their uttermost head drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no hearse can be mine and hemp only can kill me ha ha suddenly the water around them slowly swelled in broad circle then quickly upheaved a if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound wa heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breath a bedraggled with trailing rope and harpoon and lance a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty foot upwards the water flashed for an instant like heap of fountain then brokenly sank in a shower of flake leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale give way cried ahab to the oarsman and the boat darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterday s fresh iron that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angel that fell from heaven the wide tier of welded tendon overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together a head on he came churning his tail among the boat and once more flailed them apart spilling out the iron and lance from the two mate boat and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bow but leaving ahab s almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained plank and a the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank a he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round and round to the fish s back pinioned in the turn upon turn in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involution of the line around him the half torn body of the parsee wa seen his sable raiment frayed to shred his distended eye turned full upon old ahab the harpoon dropped from his hand befooled befooled drawing in a long lean breath aye parsee i see thee again aye and thou goest before and this this then is the hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mate to the ship those boat are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to die down men the first thing that but offer to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not other men but my arm and my leg and so obey me where s the whale gone down again but he looked too nigh the boat for a if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and a if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick wa now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the ship which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea oh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third day to desist see moby dick seek thee not it is thou thou that madly seekest him setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat wa swiftly impelled to leeward by both oar and canvas and at last when ahab wa sliding by the vessel so near a plainly to distinguish starbuck s face a he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mast head while the oarsman were rocking in the two staved boat which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after the other through the port hole a he sped he also caught flying glimpse of stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundle of new iron and lance a he saw all this a he heard the hammer in the broken boat far other hammer seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or flag wa gone from the main mast head he shouted to tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nail and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three day running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it wa some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever wa true the white whale s way now began to abate a it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whale s last start had not been so long a one a before and still a ahab glided over the wave the unpitying shark accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oar that the blade became jagged and crunched and left small splinter in the sea at almost every dip heed them not those teeth but give new rowlock to your oar pull on ti the better rest the shark s jaw than the yielding water but at every bite sir the thin blade grow smaller and smaller they will last long enough pull on but who can tell he muttered whether these shark swim to feast on the whale or on ahab but pull on aye all alive now we near him the helm take the helm let me pas and so saying two of the oarsman helped him forward to the bow of the still flying boat at length a the craft wa cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whale s flank he seemed strangely oblivious of it advance a the whale sometimes will and ahab wa fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whale s spout curled round his great monadnock hump he wa even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arm lengthwise high lifted to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale a both steel and curse sank to the socket a if sucked into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea a it wa three of the oarsman who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for it effect these were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to it level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turn with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seat and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air what break in me some sinew crack ti whole again oar oar burst in upon him hearing the tremendous rush of the sea crashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecution bethinking it it may be a larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon it advancing prow smiting his jaw amid fiery shower of foam ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hand stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way is t night the whale the ship cried the cringing oarsman oar oar slope downwards to thy depth o sea that ere it be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship but a the oarsman violently forced their boat through the sledge hammering sea the before whale smitten bow end of two plank burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the wave it half wading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water meantime for that one beholding instant tashtego s mast head hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag half wrapping him a with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him a his own forward flowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the down coming monster just a soon a he the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet power of air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a woman s fainting fit up helm i say ye fool the jaw the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayer all my life long fidelity oh ahab ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turn to meet u oh his unappeasable brow drive on towards one whose duty tell him he can not depart my god stand by me now stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help stubb for stubb too stick here i grin at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubb s own unwinking eye and now poor stubb go to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale look ye sun moon and star i call ye assassin of a good a fellow a ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glass with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but there ll be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye not o ahab for me off shoe and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawer a most mouldy and over salted death though cherry cherry cherry oh flask for one red cherry ere we die cherry i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope my poor mother s drawn my part pay ere this if not few copper will now come to her for the voyage is up from the ship s bow nearly all the seaman now hung inactive hammer bit of plank lance and harpoon mechanically retained in their hand just a they had darted from their various employment all their enchanted eye intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him a he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship s starboard bow till men and timber reeled some fell flat upon their face like dislodged truck the head of the harpooneer aloft shook on their bull like neck through the breach they heard the water pour a mountain torrent down a flume the ship the hearse the second hearse cried ahab from the boat it wood could only be american diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along it keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yard of ahab s boat where for a time he lay quiescent i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered spire of mine thou uncracked keel and only god bullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and pole pointed prow death glorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captain oh lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lie in my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bound pour ye now in ye bold billow of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death towards thee i roll thou all destroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with thee from hell s heart i stab at thee for hate s sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffin and all hearse to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to piece while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale thus i give up the spear the harpoon wa darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the groove ran foul ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly a turkish mute bowstring their victim he wa shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he wa gone next instant the heavy eye splice in the rope s final end flew out of the stark empty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in it depth for an instant the tranced boat s crew stood still then turned the ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering medium saw her sidelong fading phantom a in the gaseous fata morgana only the uppermost mast out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perch the pagan harpooneer still maintained their sinking lookout on the sea and now concentric circle seized the lone boat itself and all it crew and each floating oar and every lance pole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight but a the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inch of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yard of the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billow they almost touched at that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a sky hawk that tauntingly had followed the main truck downwards from it natural home among the star pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept it broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savage beneath in his death gasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shriek and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it now small fowl flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against it steep side then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on a it rolled five thousand year ago epilogue and i only am escaped alone to tell thee job the drama s done why then here doe any one step forth because one did survive the wreck it so chanced that after the parsee s disappearance i wa he whom the fate ordained to take the place of ahab s bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat wa dropped astern so floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i wa then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had subsided to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting towards the button like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another ixion i did revolve till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of it cunning spring and owing to it great buoyancy rising with great force the coffin life buoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main
