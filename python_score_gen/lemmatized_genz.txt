like their bone are gon na be neon and brittle or starting point is something like accutane ha anybody ever had neon bone why is that accutane neon bone ha anybody ever had neon bone why is that like

all thirst over me for whatever reason starting point is it may be people in public see me and maybe they re like oh she s kind of cute whatever but then they come up to me and speak to me and they re

when he wa eating i wa talking to josh in his room and then i like went to the hallway and i wa standing like at the crack of drew s door watching him and i watched him eat and like just exist for two minute without him noticing and it there wa like it you know when you re about to scare somebody get to that point where you re like this is really weird this is creepy like they are not acknowledging

bite but i wa not in the state of mind to give a correct opinion on it but drew ordered a hot dog with mac and cheese on it it wa good a from wienerschnitzel y all starting point is and he wa like oh it s so good because the mac and cheese and the hot dog are so fake like yeah um it wa good though it did taste like the way i remember kind of vomiting my daycare tasting yeah it wa like it wa very plasticine clay like never drying clay like you have to bake it to dry it like that beat but um that hot dog with the mac and cheese wa good but when you dipped it in the it elevates it to another fucking level y all kind of taste like like bile like you know like stomach acid when you have like acid reflux why do you want to taste that because it reminds me of my childhood starting point is i

magnetic and sometimes i feel like you can t see that starting point is within yourself but everyone else doe but i actually don t give a fuck about that i m so lonely and i brought you there to get attention and all the attention wa just sucked away from me kai no people were like obsessed with you yeah you re low key right you knew everybody there yeah tell me more about that people were obsessed with you and people loved your aura starting point is and you just know how to communicate with people very well and i wa taking note the whole time because i wa like damn like i am a fucking

fucking god bro i thought you were going to say something for real no i just feel like my shit is way too big to be here starting point is so you probably should like stop lying because maybe that s why like you feel alone is because you lie a lot that may be it yeah i think that might be it s possible kyle i just had that feeling that you feel when you realize someone said some real as shit to you yeah and it just like i wa like oh shit like i can t remember the last time i felt that because it s usually me saying the real oh bitch you know what we didn t fucking talk about at all um okay

with good skin talking about something they did to make it better like you already have good skin and don t let that get to your head bitch that s genetics ha nothing to do with you i take care of myself no you don t i eat good i take care of myself you re just proof that like you either have starting point is good skin or you don t because with the way he eats he should have like boil forming under his eye boil hold on i m looking for the chat log shiny well i think i want y all to diagnose me and tell me if this is normal um because i know i m like i have germaphobic tendency but i wa

can be a wonderful partner in the process of self discovery you seem comfortable up there i do which is why i submitted an application in your name to juilliard it wa you better to consider opportunity now than in ten year when life may limit your choice if i overstepped i apologize no no i m not mad i m just confused what a life in the theater ha taught me is to trust one s instinct and

friend with a guy named atlas who stayed in the condemned house no one knew he wa living there other than me i used to take him food and clothes and stuff until my father found out what d he do my jaw tightens i don t know why i brought this up when i still force myself not to think about it on a daily basis he beat him up that s a naked a i want to get about that subject your turn he regard me silently for a moment a if he know there s more to that story but then he break eye contact the thought of marriage repulse me he say i m almost thirty year old and i have no desire for a wife i especially don t want child the only thing i want out of life is success lot of it but if i admit that out loud to anyone it make me sound arrogant professional success or social status he say both anyone can have child anyone can get married but not everyone can be a neurosurgeon i get a lot of pride out of that and i don t just want to be a great neurosurgeon i want to be the best in my field you re right it doe make you sound arrogant he smile my mother fear i m wasting my life away because all i do is work you re a neurosurgeon and your mother is disappointed in you i laugh good lord that s insane are parent ever really happy with their child will they ever be good enough he shake his head my child wouldn t be not many people have the drive i do so i d only be setting them up for failure that s why i ll never have any i actually think that s respectable ryle a lot of people refuse to admit they might be too selfish to have child he shake his head oh i m way too selfish to have child and i m definitely way too selfish to be in a relationship so how do you avoid it you just don t date he cut his eye to me and there s a slight grin affixed to his face when i have time there are girl who satisfy those need i don t lack for anything in that department if that s what you re asking but love ha never appealed to me it s always been more of a burden than anything i wish i looked at love like that it would make my life a hell of a lot easier i envy you i have this idea that there s a perfect man out there for me i tend to become jaded easily because no one ever meet my standard i feel like i m on an infinite search for the holy grail you should try my method he say which is one night stand he raise an eyebrow like it s an invitation i m glad it s dark because my face is on fire i could never sleep with someone if i didn t see it going anywhere i say this out loud but my word lack conviction when i say it to him he drag in a long slow breath and then roll onto his back not that kind of girl huh he say this with a trace of disappointment in his voice i match his disappointment i m not sure i d even want to turn him down if he made a move but i might have just thwarted that possibility if you wouldn t sleep with someone you just met his eye meet mine again exactly how far would you go i don t have an answer for that i roll onto my back because the way he s looking at me make me want to rethink one night stand i m not necessarily against them i suppose i ve just never been propositioned for one by someone i would consider it with until now i think is he even propositioning me i ve always been terrible at flirting he reach out and grab the edge of my lounge chair in one swift movement and with very minimal effort he drag my chair closer to him until it bump his my whole body stiffens he s so close now i can feel the warmth of his breath cutting through the cold air if i were to look at him his face would be mere inch from mine i refuse to look at him because he d probably kiss me and i know absolutely nothing about this guy other than a couple of naked truth but that doesn t weigh on my conscience at all when he rest a heavy hand on my stomach how far would you go lily his voice is decadent smooth it travel straight to my toe i don t know i whisper his finger begin to crawl toward the hem of my shirt he begin to slowly inch it upward until a slither of my stomach is showing oh jesus i whisper feeling the warmth from his hand a he slide it up my stomach against my better judgment i face him again and the look in his eye completely captivates me he look hopeful and hungry and completely confident he sink his teeth into his bottom lip a his hand begin to tease it way up my shirt i know he can feel my heart thrashing around in my chest hell he can probably hear it is this too far he asks i don t know where this side of me is coming from but i shake my head and say not even close with a grin his finger brush the underneath of my bra lightly trickling over my skin that is now covered in chill a soon a my eyelid fall shut the piercing of a ring rip through the air his hand stiffens when we both realize it s a phone his phone he drop his forehead to my shoulder dammit i frown when his hand slip out from beneath my shirt he fumble in his pocket for his phone standing up and walking several foot away from me to take the call dr kincaid he say he listens intently his hand gripping the back of his neck what about robert i m not even supposed to be on call right now more silence is followed with yeah give me ten minute on my way he end the call and slide his phone back in his pocket when he turn to face me he look a little disappointed he point to the door that lead to the stairwell i have to i nod it s fine he considers me for a moment and then hold up a finger don t move he say reaching for his phone again he walk closer and hold it up a if he s about to snap a picture of me i almost object but i don t even know why i m fully clothed it just doesn t feel that way for some reason he snap a picture of me lying in the lounge chair my arm relaxed above my head i have no idea what he plan to do with that picture but i like that he took it i like that he had the urge to remember what i look like even though he know he ll never see me again he stare at the photo on his screen for a few second and smile i m half tempted to take a picture of him in return but i m not sure i want a reminder of someone i ll never see again the thought of that is a little depressing it wa nice meeting you lily bloom i hope you defy the odds of most dream and actually accomplish yours i smile equally saddened and confused by this guy i m not sure that i ve ever spent time with someone like him before someone of a completely different lifestyle and tax bracket i probably never will again but i m pleasantly surprised to see that we aren t all that different misconception confirmed he look down at his foot for a moment a he stand in somewhat of an unsure pose it s a if he s suspended between the desire to say something else to me and the need to leave he glance at me one last time this time without so much of a poker face i can see the disappointment in the set of his mouth before he turn and walk in the other direction he open the door and i can hear his footstep fade a he rush down the stairwell i m alone on the rooftop once again but to my surprise i m a little saddened by that now chapter two lucy the roommate who love to hear herself sing is rushing around the living room gathering key shoe a pair of sunglass i m seated on the couch opening up shoebox stuffed with some of my old thing from when i lived at home i grabbed them when i wa home for my father s funeral this week you work today lucy asks nope i have bereavement leave until monday she stop in her track monday she scoff lucky bitch yes lucy i m so lucky my father died i say it sarcastically of course but i cringe when i realize it s not actually very sarcastic you know what i mean she mutter she grab her purse a she balance on one foot while sliding her shoe onto the other i m not coming home tonight staying over at alex s house the door slam behind her we have a lot in common on the surface but beyond wearing the same size clothes being the same age and both having four letter name that start with an l and end with a y there s not much else there that make u more than just roommate i m okay with that though other than the incessant singing she s pretty tolerable she s clean and she s gone a lot two of the most important quality in a roommate i m pulling the lid off the top of one of the shoebox when my cell phone ring i reach across the couch and grab it when i see that it s my mother i press my face into the couch and fake cry into a throw pillow i bring the phone to my ear hello there s three second of silence and then hello lily i sigh and sit back up on the couch hey mom i m really surprised she s speaking to me it s only been one day since the funeral that s day sooner than i expected to hear from her how are you i ask she sigh dramatically fine she say your aunt and uncle went back to nebraska this morning it ll be my first night alone since you ll be fine mom i say trying to sound confident she s quiet for too long and then she say lily i just want you to know that you shouldn t be embarrassed about what happened yesterday i pause i wasn t not even the slightest bit everyone freeze up once in a while i shouldn t have put that kind of pressure on you knowing how hard the day wa on you already i should have just had your uncle do it i close my eye here she go again covering up what she doesn t want to see taking blame that isn t even hers to take of course she convinced herself that i froze up yesterday and that s why i refused to speak of course she did i have half a mind to tell her it wasn t a mistake i didn t freeze up i just had nothing great to say about the unremarkable man she chose to be my father but part of me doe feel guilty for what i did specifically because it s not something i should have done in the presence of my mother so i just accept what she s doing and go along with it thanks mom sorry i choked it s fine lily i need to go i have to run to the insurance office we have a meeting about your father s policy call me tomorrow okay i will i tell her love you mom i end the call and toss the phone across the couch i open the shoebox on my lap and pull out the content on the very top is a small wooden hollow heart i run my finger over it and remember the night i wa given this heart a soon a the memory begin to sink in i set it aside nostalgia is a funny thing i move a few old letter and newspaper clipping aside beneath all of it i find what i wa hoping wa inside these box and also sort of hoping wasn t my ellen diary i run my hand over them there are three of them in this box but i d say there are probably eight or nine total i haven t read any of these since the last time i wrote in them i refused to admit that i kept a diary when i wa younger because that wa so clich instead i convinced myself that what i wa doing wa cool because it wasn t technically a diary i addressed each of my entry to ellen degeneres because i began watching her show the f irst day it aired in when i wa just a little girl i watched it every day after school and wa convinced ellen would love me if she got to know me i wrote letter to her regularly until i turned sixteen but i wrote them like one would write entry in a diary of course i knew the last thing ellen degeneres probably wanted wa a random girl s journal entry luckily i never actually sent any in but i still liked addressing all the entry to her so i continued to do that until i stopped writing in them altogether i open another shoebox and find more of them i sort through them until i grab the one from when i wa fifteen year old i flip it open searching for the day i met atlas there wasn t much that happened in my life worth writing about before he entered it but somehow i filled six journal full before he ever came into the picture i swore i d never read these again but with the passing of my father i ve been thinking about my childhood a lot maybe if i read through these journal i ll somehow find a little strength for forgiveness although i fear i m running the risk of building up even more resentment i lie back on the couch and i begin reading dear ellen before i tell you what happened today i have a really good idea for a new segment on your show it s called ellen at home i think lot of people would like to see you outside of work i always wonder what you re like at your home when it s just you and portia and the camera aren t around maybe the producer can give her a camera and sometimes she can just sneak up on you and film you doing normal thing like watching tv or cooking or gardening she could film you for a few second without you knowing and then she could scream ellen at home and scare you it s only fair since you love prank okay now that i told you that i keep meaning to and have been forgetting i ll tell you about my day yesterday it wa interesting probably my most interesting day to write about yet if you don t count the day abigail ivory slapped mr carson for looking at her cleavage you remember a while back when i told you about mr burleson who lived behind u she died the night of that big snowstorm my dad said she owed so much in tax that her daughter wasn t able to take ownership of the house which is fine by her i m sure because the house wa starting to fall apart anyway it probably would have been more of a burden than anything the house ha been empty since mr burleson died which ha been about two year i know it s been empty because my bedroom window look out over the backyard and there hasn t been a single soul that go in or out of that house since i can remember until last night i wa in bed shuffling card i know that sound weird but it s just something i do i don t even know how to play card but when my parent get into fight shuffling card just calm me down sometimes and give me something to focus on anyway it wa dark outside so i noticed the light right away it wasn t bright but it wa coming from that old house it looked more like candlelight than anything so i went to the back porch and found dad s binoculars i tried to see what wa going on over there but i couldn t see anything it wa way too dark then after a little while the light went out this morning when i wa getting ready for school i saw something moving behind that house i crouched down at my bedroom window and saw someone sneaking out the back door it wa a guy and he had a backpack he looked around like he wa making sure no one saw him and then he walked between our house and the neighbor s house and went and stood at the bus stop i d never seen him before it wa the first time he rode my bus he sat in the back and i sat in the middle so i didn t talk to him but when he got off the bus at school i saw him walk into the school so he must go there i have no idea why he wa sleeping in that house there s probably no electricity or running water i thought maybe he did it a a dare but today he got off the bus at the same stop a me he walked down the street like he wa going somewhere else but i ran straight to my room and watched out the window sure enough a few minute later i saw him sneaking back inside that empty house i don t know if i should say something to my mother i hate to be nosy because it s none of my business but if that guy doesn t have anywhere to go i feel like my mother would know how to help him since she work at a school i don t know i might wait a couple day before i say something and see if he go back home he might just need a break from his parent same a i wish i could have sometimes that s all i ll let you know what happens tomorrow lily dear ellen i fast forward through all your dancing when i watch your show i used to watch the beginning when you danced through the audience but i get a little bored with it now and would rather just hear you talk i hope that doesn t make you mad okay so i found out who the guy is and yes he s still going over there it s been two day now and i still haven t told anyone his name is atlas corrigan and he s a senior but that s all i know i asked katie who he wa when she sat next to me on the bus she rolled her eye and told me his name but then she said i don t know anything else about him but he smell she scrunched up her nose like it grossed her out i wanted to yell at her and tell her he can t help it that he doesn t have any running water but instead i just looked back at him i might have stared a little too much because he caught me looking at him when i got home i went to the backyard to do some gardening my radish were ready to be pulled so i wa out there pulling them the radish are the only thing left in my garden it s starting to get cold so there s not much else i can plant right now i probably could have waited a few more day to pull them but i wa also outside because i wa being nosy i noticed a i wa pulling them that some were missing it looked like they had just been dug up i know i didn t pull them and my parent never mess with my garden that s when i thought about atlas and how it wa more than likely him i hadn t thought about how if he doesn t have access to a shower he probably doesn t have food either i went inside my house and made a couple of sandwich i grabbed two soda out of the fridge and a bag of chip i put them in a lunch bag and i ran it over to the abandoned house and set it on the back porch by the door i wasn t sure if he saw me so i knocked real hard and then ran back to my house and went straight to my room by the time i got to the window to see if he wa going to come outside the bag wa already gone that s when i knew he d been watching me i m kind of nervous now that he know i know he s staying there i don t know what i ll say to him if he try to talk to me tomorrow lily dear ellen i saw your interview with the presidential candidate barack obama today doe that make you nervous interviewing people who could potentially run the country i don t know a lot about politics but i don t think i could be funny under that kind of pressure man so much ha happened to both of u you just interviewed someone who might be our next president and i m feeding a homeless boy this morning when i got to the bus stop atlas wa already there it wa just the two of u at first and i m not gon na lie it wa awkward i could see the bus coming around the corner and i wa wishing it would drive a little faster right when it pulled up he took a step closer to me and without looking up he said thank you the door opened on the bus and he let me walk on first i didn t say you re welcome because i wa kind of shocked by my reaction his voice gave me chill ellen ha a boy s voice ever done that to you oh wait sorry ha a girl s voice ever done that to you he didn t sit by me or anything on the way there but on the way back from school he wa the last one getting on there weren t any empty seat but i could tell by the way he scanned all the people on the bus that he wasn t looking for an empty seat he wa looking for me when his eye met mine i looked down at my lap real quick i hate that i m not very confident around guy maybe that s something i ll grow into when i f inally turn sixteen he sat down next to me and dropped his backpack between his leg that s when i noticed what katie wa talking about he did kind of smell but i didn t judge him for that he didn t say anything at first but he wa fidgeting with a hole in his jean it wasn t the kind of hole that wa there to make jean look stylish i could tell it wa there because it wa a genuine hole due to his pant being old they actually looked a little too small for him because his ankle were showing but he wa skinny enough that they fit him just fine everywhere else did you tell anyone he asked me i looked at him when he spoke and he wa looking right back at me like he wa worried it wa the first time i had actually gotten a good look at him his hair wa dark brown but i thought maybe if he washed it it wouldn t be a dark a it looked right then his eye were bright unlike the rest of him real blue eye like the kind you see on a siberian husky i shouldn t compare his eye to a dog but that s the first thing i thought when i saw them i shook my head and looked back out the window i thought he might get up and find another seat at that point since i said i didn t tell anyone but he didn t the bus made a few stop and the fact that he wa still sitting by me gave me a little courage so i made my voice a whisper why don t you live at home with your parent he stared at me for a few second like he wa trying to decide if he wanted to trust me or not then he said because they don t want me to that s when he got up i thought i d made him mad but then i realized he got up because we were at our stop i grabbed my stuff and followed him off the bus he didn t try to hide where he wa heading today like he usually doe normally he walk down the street and go around the block so i don t see him cut through my backyard but today he started to walk toward my yard with me when we got to where i would normally turn to go inside and he would keep walking we both stopped he kicked at the dirt with his foot and looked behind me at my house what time do your parent get home around five i said it wa he nodded and looked like he wa about to say something else but he didn t he just nodded again and started walking toward that house with no food or electricity or water now ellen i know what i did next wa stupid so you don t have to tell me i called out his name and when he stopped and turned around i said if you hurry you can take a shower before they get home my heart wa beating so fast because i knew how much trouble i could get into if my parent came home and found a homeless guy in our shower i d probably very well die but i just couldn t watch him walk back to his house without offering him something he looked down at the ground again and i felt his embarrassment in my own stomach he didn t even nod he just followed me inside my house and never said a word the whole time he wa in the shower i wa panicking i kept looking out the window and checking for either of my parent car even though i knew it would be a good hour before they got home i wa nervous one of the neighbor might have seen him come inside but they didn t really know me well enough to think having a visitor would be abnormal i had given atlas a change of clothes and knew he not only needed to be out of the house when my parent got home but he needed to be far away from our house i m sure my father would recognize his own clothes on some random teenager in the neighborhood in between looking out the window and checking the clock i wa filling up one of my old backpack with stuff food that didn t need refrigerating a couple of my father s t shirt a pair of jean that were probably going to be two size too big for him and a change of sock i wa zipping up the backpack when he emerged from the hallway i wa right even wet i could tell his hair wa lighter than it looked earlier it made his eye look even bluer he must have shaved while he wa in there because he looked younger than he did before he got in the shower i swallowed and looked back down at the backpack because i wa shocked at how different he looked i wa scared he might see my thought written across my face i looked out the window one more time and handed him the backpack you might want to go out the back door so no one see you he took the backpack from me and stared at my face for a minute what s your name he said a he slung the pack over his shoulder lily he smiled it wa the first time he d smiled at me and i had an awful shallow thought in that moment i wondered how someone with such a great smile could have such shitty parent i immediately hated myself for thinking it because of course parent should love their kid no matter how cute or ugly or skinny or fat or smart or stupid they are but sometimes you can t control where your mind go you just have to train it not to go there anymore he held out his hand and said i m atlas i know i said without shaking his hand i don t know why i didn t shake his hand it wasn t because i wa scared to touch him i mean i wa scared to touch him but not because i thought i wa better than him he just made me so nervous he put his hand down and nodded once then said i guess i better go i stepped aside so he could walk around me he pointed past the kitchen silently asking if that wa the way to the back door i nodded and walked behind him a he made his way down the hall when he reached the back door i saw him pause for a second when he saw my bedroom i wa suddenly embarrassed that he wa seeing my bedroom no one ever see my bedroom so i ve never felt the need to give it a more mature look i still have the same pink bedspread and curtain i ve had since i wa twelve for the f irst time ever i felt like ripping down my poster of adam brody atlas didn t seem to care how my room wa decorated he looked straight at my window the one that look out over the backyard then he glanced back at me right before he walked out the back door he said thank you for not being disparaging lily and then he wa gone of course i ve heard the term disparaging before but it wa weird hearing a teenage guy use it what s even weirder is how everything about atlas seems so contradictory how doe a guy who is obviously humble well mannered and us word like disparaging end up homeless how doe any teenager end up homeless i need to find out ellen i m going to find out what happened to him you just wait and see lily i m about to open another entry when my phone ring i crawl across the couch for it and i m not the least bit surprised to see it s my mother again now that my father ha passed and she s alone she ll probably call me twice a much a she did before hello what do you think about my moving to boston she blurts out i grab the throw pillow next to me and shove my face into it muffling a scream um wow i say really she s quiet and then it wa just a thought we can discus it tomorrow i m almost to my meeting okay bye and just like that i want to move out of massachusetts she can t move here she doesn t know anyone here she d expect me to entertain her every day i love my mother don t get me wrong but i moved to boston to be on my own and having her in the same city would make me feel less independent my father wa diagnosed with cancer three year ago while i wa still in college if ryle kincaid were here right now i d tell him the naked truth that i wa a little bit relieved when my father became too ill to physically hurt my mother it completely changed the dynamic of their relationship and i no longer felt obligated to stay in plethora to make sure she wa okay now that my father is gone and i never have to worry about my mother again i wa looking forward to spreading my wing so to speak but now she s moving to boston it feel like my wing were just clipped where is a marine grade polymer chair when i need one i m seriously stressing out and i have no idea what i d do if my mother move to boston i don t have a garden or a yard or a patio or weed i have to find another outlet i decide to clean i place all of my old shoebox full of journal and note in my bedroom closet then i organize my entire closet my jewelry my shoe my clothes she can not move to boston chapter three six month later oh that s all she say my mother turn and assesses the building running a finger over the windowsill next to her she pick up a layer of dust and wipe it between her finger it s it need a lot of work i know i interrupt i point at the window behind her but look at the storefront it ha potential she scroll over the window nodding there s this sound she make in the back of her throat sometimes where she agrees with a little hum but her lip remain tight it mean she doesn t actually agree and she make that sound twice i drop my arm in defeat you think this wa stupid she give her head a slight shake that all depends on how it turn out lily she say the building used to house a restaurant and it s still full of old table and chair my mother walk over to a nearby table and pull out one of the chair taking a seat if thing work out and your floral shop is successful then people will say it wa a brave bold smart business decision but if it fails and you lose your entire inheritance then people will say it wa a stupid business decision she shrug that s just how it work you majored in business you know that she glance around the room slowly a if she s seeing it the way it will look a month from now just make sure it s brave and bold lily i smile i can accept that i can t believe i bought it without asking you first i say taking a seat at the table you re an adult it s your right she say but i can hear a trace of disappointment i think she feel even lonelier now that i need her less and less it s been six month since my father died and even though he wasn t good company it ha to be weird for her being alone she got a job at one of the elementary school so she did end up moving here she chose a small suburb on the outskirt of boston she bought a cute two bedroom house on a cul de sac with a huge backyard i dream of planting a garden there but that would require daily care my limit is once a week visit sometimes twice what are you going to do with all this junk she asks she s right there s so much junk it ll take forever to clear this place out i have no idea i guess i ll be busting my as for a while before i can even think about decorating when s your last day at the marketing firm i smile yesterday she release a sigh and then shake her head oh lily i certainly hope this work out in your favor we both begin to stand when the front door open there are shelf in the way of the door so i careen my head around them and see a woman walk in her eye briefly scan the room until she see me hi she say with a wave she s cute she s dressed well but she s wearing white capri a disaster waiting to happen in this dust bowl can i help you she tuck her purse beneath her arm and walk toward me holding out her hand i m allysa she say i shake her hand lily she toss a thumb over her shoulder there s a help wanted sign out front i look over her shoulder and raise an eyebrow there is i didn t put up a help wanted sign she nod and then shrug it look old though she say it s probably been there a while i wa just out for a walk and saw the sign wa curious is all i like her almost immediately her voice is pleasant and her smile seems genuine my mother s hand fall down on my shoulder and she lean in and kiss me on the cheek i have to go she say open house tonight i tell her goodbye and watch her walk outside then turn my attention back to allysa i m not really hiring yet i say i wave my hand around the room i m opening up a floral shop but it ll be a couple of month at least i should know better than to hold preconceived judgment but she doesn t look like she d be satisfied with a minimum wage job her purse probably cost more than this building her eye light up really i love flower she spin around in a circle and say this place ha a ton of potential what color are you painting it i cross my arm over my chest and grab my elbow rocking back on my heel i say i m not sure i just got the key to the building an hour ago so i haven t really come up with a design plan yet lily right i nod i m not going to pretend i have a degree in design but it s my absolute favorite thing if you need any help i d do it for free i tilt my head you d work for free she nod i don t really need a job i just saw the sign and thought what the heck but i do get bored sometimes i d be happy to help you with whatever you need cleaning decorating picking out paint color i m a pinterest whore something behind me catch her eye and she point i could take that broken door and make it magnificent all this stuff really there s a use for almost everything you know i look around at the room knowing full well i m not going to be able to tackle this by myself i probably can t even lift half this stuff alone i ll eventually have to hire someone anyway i m not going to let you work for free but i could do an hour if you re really serious she start clapping and if she weren t in heel she might have jumped up and down when can i start i glance down at her white capri will tomorrow work you ll probably want to show up in disposable clothes she wave me off and drop her herm s bag on a dusty table next to her nonsense she say my husband is watching the bruin play at a bar down the street if it s okay i ll just hang with you and get started right now two hour later i m convinced i ve met my new best friend and she really is a pinterest whore we write keep and toss on sticky note and slap them on everything in the room she s a fellow believer in upcycling so we come up with idea for at least percent of the stuff left in the building the rest she say her husband can throw out when he ha free time once we know what we re going to do with all the stuff i grab a notebook and a pen and we sit at one of the table to write down design idea okay she say leaning back in her chair i want to laugh because her white capri are covered in dirt now but she doesn t seem to care do you have a goal for this place she asks glancing around i have one i say succeed she laugh i have no doubt you ll succeed but you do need a vision i think about what my mother said just make sure it s brave and bold lily i smile and sit up straighter in my chair brave and bold i say i want this place to be different i want to take risk she narrow her eye a she chew on the tip of the pen but you re just selling flower she say how can you be brave and bold with flower i look around the room and try to envision what i m thinking i m not even sure what i m thinking i m just getting itchy and restless like i m on the verge of a brilliant idea what are some word that come to mind when you think of flower i ask her she shrug i don t know they re sweet i guess they re alive so they make me think of life and maybe the color pink and spring sweet life pink spring i repeat and then allysa you re brilliant i stand up and begin pacing the floor we ll take everything everyone love about flower and we ll do the complete opposite she make a face to let me know she isn t following okay i say what if instead of showcasing the sweet side of f lower we showcased the villainous side instead of pink accent we use darker color like a deep purple or even black and instead of just spring and life we also celebrate winter and death allysa s eye are wide but what if someone want pink flower though well we ll still give them what they want of course but we ll also give them what they don t know they want she scratch her cheek so you re thinking black flower she look concerned and i don t blame her she s only seeing the darkest side of my vision i take a seat at the table again and try to get her on board someone once told me that there is no such thing a bad people we re all just people who sometimes do bad thing that stuck with me because it s so true we ve all got a little bit of good and evil in u i want to make that our theme instead of painting the wall a putrid sweet color we paint them dark purple with black accent and instead of only putting out the usual pastel display of flower in boring crystal vas that make people think of life we go edgy brave and bold we put out display of darker flower wrapped in thing like leather or silver chain and rather than put them in crystal vas we ll stick them in black onyx or i don t know purple velvet vas lined with silver stud the idea are endless i stand up again there are floral shop on every corner for people who love flower but what floral shop caters to all the people who hate flower allysa shake her head none of them she whisper exactly none of them we stare at each other for a moment and then i can t take it another second i m bursting with excitement and i just start laughing like a giddy child allysa start laughing too and she jump up and hug me lily it s so twisted it s brilliant i know i m full of renewed energy i need a desk so i can sit down and make a business plan but my future office is full of old vegetable crate she walk toward the back of the store well let s get them out of there and go buy you a desk we squeeze into the office and begin moving crate out one by one and into a back room i stand on the chair to make the pile taller so we ll have more room to move around these are perfect for the window display i have in mind she hand me two more crate and walk away and a i m reaching on my tiptoe to stack them at the very top the pile begin to tumble i try to f ind something to grab hold of for balance but the crate knock me off the chair when i land on the floor i can feel my foot bend in the wrong direction it s followed by a rush of pain straight up my leg and down to my toe allysa come rushing back into the room and ha to move two of the crate from on top of me lily she say oh my god are you okay i pull myself up to a sitting position but don t even try to put weight on my ankle i shake my head my ankle she immediately remove my shoe and then pull her phone out of her pocket she begin dialing a number and then look up at me i know this is a stupid question but do you happen to have a refrigerator here with ice in it i shake my head i figured she say she put the phone on speaker and set it on the floor a she begin to roll up my pant leg i wince but not so much from the pain i just can t believe i did something so stupid if i broke it i m screwed i just spent my entire inheritance on a building that i won t even be able to renovate for month heeey issa a voice croons through her phone where you at the game s over allysa pick up her phone and brings it closer to her mouth at work listen i need the guy cut her off and say at work babe you don t even have a job

don t move wait until they get here okay i have no idea what two drunken guy are going to be able to do for me but i nod my new employee feel more like my bos right now and i m kind of scared of her at the moment i wait in the back for about ten minute when i finally hear the front door to the building open what in the world a man s voice say why are you all alone in this creepy building i hear allysa say she s back here she walk in followed by a guy wearing a onesie he s tall a little bit on the thin side but boyishly handsome with big honest eye and a head full of dark messy way past due

something to put the ice in allysa follows marshall out of the room when they re both gone ryle look at me and his mouth turn up into a grin i won t charge you for this but only because i m slightly inebriated he say with a wink i tilt my head the first time i met you you were high now you re drunk i m beginning to worry you aren t going to make a very qualified neurosurgeon he laugh it would

palm against the bottom of my foot push against my hand he say i push down with my ankle it hurt but i m able to move his hand is it broken he move my foot from side to side and then say i don t think so let s give it a couple of minute and i ll see if you can put any weight on it i nod and watch a he adjusts himself across from me he sits cross legged and pull my foot onto his lap he look around the room and then directs his attention back at me so what is this place i smile a little too big lily bloom s it ll be a floral shop in about two month time i swear his whole face light up with pride no way he say you did it you re actually opening up your own business i nod yep i figured i might a well try it while i m still young enough to bounce back from failure one of his hand is holding the ice against my ankle but the other one is wrapped around my bare foot he s brushing his thumb back and forth like it s no big deal that he s touching me but his hand on my foot is way more noticeable than the pain in my ankle i look ridiculous huh he asks staring down at his solid red onesie i shrug at least you went with a non character choice it give it a bit more maturity than the spongebob option he laugh and then his smile disappears a he lean his head into the door beside him he stare at me appreciatively you re even prettier in the daytime moment like these are why i absolutely hate having red hair and fair skin the embarrassment doesn t only show up in my cheek my whole face arm and neck grow flushed i rest my head against the wall behind me and stare at him just like he s staring at me you want to hear a naked truth he nod i ve wanted to go back to your roof on more than one occasion since that night but i wa too scared you d be there you make me kind of nervous his finger pause their stroke against my foot my turn i nod his eye narrow a his hand move to the underneath of my foot he slowly trace his finger from the top of my toe down to my heel i still very much want to fuck you someone gasp and it isn t me ryle and i both look at the doorway and allysa is standing there wide eyed her mouth is open a she point down at ryle did you just she look at me and say i am so sorry about him lily and then she look back at ryle with venom in her eye did you just tell my bos you want to fuck her oh dear ryle pull his bottom lip in and chew on it for a second marshall walk in behind allysa and say what s going on allysa look at marshall and point at ryle again he just told lily he want to fuck her marshall look from ryle to me i don t know whether to laugh or crawl under the table and hide you did he say looking back at ryle ryle shrug it appears that way he say allysa put her head in her hand jesus christ she say looking at me he s drunk they re both drunk please don t judge me because my brother is an asshole i smile at her and wave it off it s fine allysa lot of people want to fuck me i glance back at ryle and he s still casually stroking my foot at least your brother speaks his mind not a lot of people have the courage to say what they re actually thinking ryle wink at me and then carefully move my ankle off his lap let s see if you can put any weight on it he say he and marshall help me to my foot ryle point to a table a few foot away that s pushed up against a wall let s try to make it to the table so i can wrap it his arm is secured around my waist and he s gripping my arm tightly to make sure i don t fall marshall is more or less just standing next to me for support i put a little weight on my ankle and it hurt but it s not excruciating i m able to hop all the way to the table with a lot of assistance from ryle he help me pull myself up until i m seated on top of it leaning against the wall with my leg stretched out in front of me well the good news is that it isn t broken what s the bad news i ask him he open the first aid kit and say you ll need to stay off of it for a few day maybe even a week or more depending on how it heals i close my eye and lean my head against the wall behind me but i have so much to do i whine he carefully begin to wrap my ankle allysa is standing behind him watching him wrap it i m thirsty marshall say anybody want something to drink there s a cv across the street i m good ryle say i ll take a water i say sprite allysa say marshall grab her hand you re coming with allysa pull her hand from his and cross her arm over her chest i m not going anywhere she say my brother can t be trusted allysa it s fine i tell her he wa making a joke she stare at me silently for a moment and then say okay but you can t fire me if he pull more stupid shit i promise i won t fire you with that she grab marshall s hand again and leaf the room ryle is still wrapping my foot when he say my sister work for you yep hired her a couple of hour ago he reach into the first aid kit and pull out tape you do realize she s never had a job in her entire life she already warned me i say his jaw is tight and he doesn t look a relaxed a he did earlier then it hit me that he might think i hired her a a way to get closer to him i had no idea she wa your sister until you walked in i swear he glance at me and then back down at my foot i wasn t suggesting you knew he begin to tape over the ace bandage i know you weren t i just didn t want you to think i wa trying to trap you somehow we want two different thing from life remember he nod and carefully set my foot back on the table that is correct he say i specialize in one night stand and you re on the quest for your holy grail i laugh you have a good memory i do he say a languid smile stretch across his mouth but you re also hard to forget jesus he ha to stop saying thing like that i press my palm into the table and pull my leg down naked truth coming he lean against the table next to me and say all ear i hold nothing back i m very attracted to you i say there s not much about you i don t like and being a though you and i both want different thing if we re ever around each other again i d appreciate it if you could stop saying thing that make me dizzy it s not really fair to me he nod once and then say my turn he place his hand on the table next to me and lean in a little i m very attracted to you too there s not much about you i don t like but i kind of hope we re never around each other again because i don t like how much i think about you which isn t all that much but it s more than i d like so if you still aren t going to agree to a one night stand then i think it s best if we do what we can to avoid each other because it won t do either of u any favor i don t know how he ended up this close to me but he s only about a foot away his proximity make it hard to pay attention to word that come out of his mouth his gaze drop briefly to my mouth but a soon a we hear the front door open he s halfway across the room by the time allysa and marshall make it to u ryle is busy restacking all the crate that fell allysa look down at my ankle what s the verdict she asks i push my bottom lip out your doctor brother say i have to stay off of it for a few day she hand me my water good thing you have me i can work and do what i can to clean up while you rest i take a drink of the water and then wipe my mouth allysa i m declaring you employee of the month she grin and then turn to marshall did you hear that i m the best employee she ha he put his arm around her and kiss the top of her head i m proud of you issa i like that he call her issa which i m assuming is short for allysa i think about my own name and if i ll ever find a guy who could shorten it into a sickeningly cute nickname illy nope not the same do you need help getting home she asks i hop down and test my foot maybe just to my car it s my left foot so i can probably drive just fine she walk over and put her arm around me if you want to leave the key with me i ll lock up and come back tomorrow and start cleaning the three of them walk me to my car but ryle allows allysa to do most of the work he seems almost scared to touch me now for some reason when i m in the driver s seat allysa put my purse and other thing in the floorboard and sits in the passenger seat she take my phone out and begin programming her number into it ryle lean into the window make sure to keep ice on it a much a you can for the next few day bath help too i nod thanks for your help allysa lean over and say ryle maybe you should drive her home and take a cab back to the apartment just to be safe ryle look down at me and then shake his head i don t think that s a good idea he say she ll be fine i ve had a few beer probably shouldn t be driving you could at least help her home allysa suggests ryle shake his head and then pat the roof of the car a he turn and walk away i m still watching him when allysa hand me back my phone and say seriously i m really sorry about him first he hit on you then he s a selfish asshole she climb out of the car and close the door then lean through the window that s why he ll be single for the rest of his life she point to my phone text me when you get home and call me if you need anything i won t count favor a work time thank you allysa she smile no thank you i haven t been this excited about my life since that paolo nutini concert i went to last year she wave goodbye and walk toward where marshall and ryle are standing they begin walking down the street and i watch them in my rearview mirror a they turn the corner i see ryle glance over his shoulder and look back in my direction i close my eye and exhale the two time i ve spent with ryle were on day i d probably rather forget my father s funeral and spraining my ankle but somehow him being present made them feel like less of the disaster they were i hate that he s allysa s brother i have a feeling this isn t the last time i ll be seeing him chapter four it take me half an hour to make it from my car to my apartment i called lucy twice to see if she could help me but she didn t answer her phone when i make it inside my apartment i m a little irritated to see her lying on the couch with the phone to her ear i slam our front door behind me and she glance up what happened to you she asks i use the wall for support a i hop toward the hallway sprained my ankle when i make it to my bedroom door she yell sorry i didn t answer the phone i m talking to alex i wa gon na call you back it s fine i holler back at her and then slam my bedroom door shut i go to the bathroom and find some old pain pill i had stuffed into a cabinet i swallow two of them and then fall onto my bed and stare up at the ceiling i can t believe i ll be stuck in this apartment for an entire week i grab my phone and text my mother sprained my ankle i m fine but can i send you a list of thing to grab for me at the store i drop my phone onto my bed and for the first time since she moved here i m thankful my mother life fairly close to me it actually hasn t been that bad i think i like her more now that my father ha passed away i know it s because i held a lot of resentment toward her for never leaving him even though a lot of that resentment ha faded when it come to my mother i still have the same feeling when i think of my father it can t be good still holding on to so much bitterness toward my father but dammit he wa awful to my mother to me to atlas atlas i ve been so busy with my mother s move and secretly searching for a new building between work hour i haven t had time to finish reading the journal i started reading all those month ago i hop pathetically to my closet only tripping once luckily i catch myself on my dresser once i have the journal in hand i hop back to the bed and get comfortable i have nothing better to do for the next week now that i can t work i might a well commiserate over my past while i m forced to commiserate in the present dear ellen you hosting the oscar wa the greatest thing to happen to tv last year i don t think i ever told you that the vacuuming skit made me piss my pant oh and i recruited a new ellen follower today in atlas before you start judging me for allowing him inside my house again let me explain how that came about after i let him take a shower here yesterday i didn t see him again last night but this morning he sat by me on the bus again he seemed a little happier than the day before because he slid into the seat and actually smiled at me i m not gon na lie it wa a little weird seeing him in my dad s clothes but the pant fit him a lot better than i thought they were going to guess what he said he leaned forward and unzipped his backpack what he pulled out a bag and handed it to me i found these in the garage i tried to clean them up for you because they were covered in old dirt but i can t do much without water i held the bag and stared at him suspiciously it s the most i d ever heard him say at once i finally looked down at the bag and opened it it looked like a bunch of old gardening tool i saw you digging with that shovel the other day i wasn t sure if you had any actual gardening tool and no one wa using these so thank you i said i wa kind of in shock i used to have a trowel but the plastic broke off the handle and it started giving me blister i asked my mother for gardening tool for my birthday last year and when she bought me a full sized shovel and a hoe i didn t have the heart to tell her it s not what i needed atlas cleared his throat and then in a much quieter voice he said i know it s not like a real gift i didn t buy it or anything but i wanted to give you something you know for he didn t finish his sentence so i nodded and tied the bag back up do you think you can hold them for me until after school i don t have any room in my backpack he grabbed the bag from me and then brought his backpack up to his lap and put the bag inside of it he wrapped his arm around his backpack how old are you he asked fifteen the look in his eye made him seem a little bit sad about my age but i don t know why you re in tenth grade i nodded but honestly couldn t think of anything to say to him i haven t really had much interaction with a lot of guy especially senior when i m nervous i kind of just clam up i don t know how long i ll be staying at that place he said bringing his voice down again but if you ever need help with gardening or anything after school it s not like i have much going on there being a though i have no electricity i laughed and then wondered if i should have laughed at his self deprecating comment we spent the rest of the bus ride talking about you ellen when he made that comment about being bored i asked him if he ever watched your show he said he d like to because he think you re funny but a tv would require electricity another comment i wasn t sure if i should have laughed at i told him he could watch your show with me after school i always record it on the dvr and watch it while i do my chore i figured i could just keep the front door dead bolted and if my parent got home early i d just have atlas run out the back door i didn t see him again until the ride home today he didn t sit by me this time because katie got on the bus before him and sat next to me i wanted to ask her to move but then she d think i had a crush on atlas katie would have a field day with that one so i just let her stay in my seat atlas wa at the front of the bus so he got off before i did he just kind of awkwardly stood there at the bus stop and waited for me to get off when i did he opened his backpack and handed me the bag of tool he didn t say anything about my invitation to watch tv from earlier this morning so i just acted like it wa a given come on i told him he followed me inside and i locked the dead bolt if my parent come home early run out the back door and don t let them see you he nodded don t worry i will he said with kind of a laugh i asked him if he wanted anything to drink and he said sure i made u a snack and brought our drink to the living room i sat down on the couch and he sat down in my dad s chair i turned on your show and that s about all that happened we didn t talk much because i fast forwarded through all the commercial but i did notice he laughed at all the right time i think good comedic timing is one of the most important thing about a person s personality every time he laughed at your joke it made me feel better about sneaking him into my house i don t know why maybe because if he s actually someone i could be friend with it d make me feel less guilty he left right after your show wa over i wanted to ask him if he needed to use our shower again but that would have cut it real close to time for my parent getting home the last thing i wanted wa for him to have to run out of the shower and across my backyard naked then again that d be kind of hilarious and awesome lily dear ellen come on woman rerun a full week of rerun i get that you need time off but let me make a suggestion instead of recording one show a day you should record two that way you ll get twice a much done in half the time and we d never have to sit through rerun i say we because i m referring to atlas and me he s become my regular ellen watching partner i think he might love you a much a i do but i ll never tell him i write to you on a daily basis that might seem a little too fan girl he s been living in that house for two week now he s taken a few more shower at my house and i give him food every time he visit i even wash his clothes for him while he s here after school he keep apologizing to me like he s a burden but honestly i love it he keep my mind off thing and i actually look forward to spending time with him after school every day dad got home late tonight which mean he went to the bar after work which mean he s probably going to instigate a fight with my mother which mean he ll probably do something stupid again i swear sometimes i get so mad at her for staying with him i know i m only f ifteen and probably don t understand all the reason she chooses to stay but i refuse to let her use me a her excuse i don t care if she s too poor to leave him and we d have to move into a crappy apartment and eat ramen noodle until i graduate that would be better than this i can hear him yelling at her right now sometimes when he get like this i walk into the living room hoping it ll calm him down he doesn t like to hit her when i m in the room maybe i should go try that lily dear ellen if i had access to a gun or knife right now i d kill him a soon a i walked into the living room i saw him push her down they were standing in the kitchen and she d grabbed his arm trying to calm him down and he backhanded her and knocked her straight to the floor i m pretty sure he wa about to kick her but he saw me walk into the living room and he stopped he muttered something under his breath to her and then walked to their bedroom and slammed the door i rushed to the kitchen and tried to help her but she never want me to see her like this she waved me away and said i m fine lily i m fine we just got into a stupid fight she wa cry and i could already see the redness on her cheek from where he hit her when i walked closer to her wanting to make sure she wa okay she turned her back to me and gripped the counter i said i m fine lily go back to your room i ran back down the hallway but i didn t go back to my room i ran straight out the back door and across the backyard i wa so mad at her for being short with me i didn t even want to be in the same house a either of them and even thought it wa dark already i went over to the house atlas wa staying in and i knocked on the door i could hear him moving inside like he accidentally knocked something over it s me lily i whispered a few second later the back door opened and he looked behind me then to the left and right of me it wasn t until he looked at my face that he saw i wa cry you okay he asked stepping outside i used my shirt to wipe away my tear and noticed he came outside instead of inviting me in i sat down on the porch step and he sat down next to me i m fine i said i m just mad sometimes i cry when i get mad he reached over and tucked my hair behind my ear i liked it when he did that and i suddenly wasn t nearly a mad anymore then he put his arm around me and pulled me to him so that my head wa resting on his shoulder i don t know how he calmed me down without even talking but he did some people just have a calming presence about them and he s one of those people completely opposite of my father we sat like that for a while until i saw my bedroom light turn on you should go he whispered we could both see my mom standing in my bedroom looking for me it wasn t until that moment that i realized what a perfect view he ha of my bedroom a i walked back home i tried to think about the entire time atlas ha been in that house i tried to recall if i d walked around after dark with the light on at night because all i normally wear in my room at night is a t shirt here s what s crazy about that ellen i wa kind of hoping i had lily i close the journal when the pain pill start to kick in i ll read more tomorrow maybe reading about the thing my dad used to do to my mom kind of put me in a bad mood reading about atlas kind of put me in a sad mood i try to fall asleep and think about ryle but the whole situation with him kind of make me mad and sad maybe i ll just think about allysa and how happy i am that she showed up today i could use a friend not to mention help during these next few month i have a feeling it s going to be more stressful than i bargained for chapter five ryle wa correct it only took a few day for my ankle to feel good enough that i could walk on it again i waited a full week before attempting to leave my apartment though the last thing i need is to reinjure it of course the first place i went wa to my floral shop allysa wa there when i arrived today and to say i wa shocked when i walked through the front door is an understatement it looked like a totally different building than the one i bought there s still a ton of work that need to be done but she and marshall had gotten rid of all the stuff we marked a trash everything else had been organized into pile the window had been washed the floor had been mopped she even had the area where i plan to put an office cleaned out i helped her for a few hour today but she wouldn t let me do much that required walking at first so i mostly drew out plan for the store we picked out paint color and set a goal date to open the store that s approximately fifty four day from now after she left i spent the next few hour doing all the stuff she wouldn t let me do while she wa there it felt good to be back but jesus christ i m tired which is why i m debating on whether or not to get up from the couch and answer the knock at my front door lucy is at alex s again tonight and i just spoke to my mother five minute ago on the phone so i know it isn t either of them i walk to the door and check the peephole before opening it i don t recognize him at first because his head is down but then he look up and to the right and my heart freak the hell out what is he doing here ryle knock again and i try to brush my hair out of my face and smooth it down with my hand but it s a lost cause i worked my as off today and i look like shit so unless i have half an hour to take a shower put on makeup and throw on clothes before i open the door he ll pretty much have to deal with me a is i open the door and his immediate reaction confuses me jesus christ he say dropping his head against my door frame he s panting like he s been working out and that s when i notice that he doesn t look to be any more rested or clean than i am he s got a couple of day worth of stubble on his face something i ve never seen on him before and his hair isn t styled like it usually is it s a little erratic like the look in his eye do you have any idea how many door i ve knocked on to find you i shake my head because i don t but now that he mention it how in the hell doe he know where i live twenty nine he say then he hold up his hand and repeat the number with his finger while he whisper two nine i let my gaze drop down to his clothes he s in scrub and i absolutely hate that he s in scrub right now holy hell so much better than the onesie and way better than the burberry why did you knock on twenty nine door i ask with a tilt of my head you never told me which apartment wa yours he say matter of factly you said you lived in this building but i couldn t remember if you even said which floor and for the record i almost started with the third floor i would have been here an hour ago if i went with my gut instinct why are you here he run his hand down his face and then point over my shoulder can i come in i glance over my shoulder and then open the door farther i guess if you tell me what you want he walk inside and i close the door behind u he glance around wearing his stupid hot scrub and put his hand on his hip a he face me he look a little disappointed but i m not sure if it s in me or himself there s a really big naked truth coming okay he say brace yourself i fold my arm over my chest and watch a he inhales a breath preparing to speak these next couple of month are the most important month in my entire career i have to be focused i m closing in on the end of my residency and then i ll have to sit for my exam he s pacing my living room talking frantically with his hand but for the past week i haven t been able to get you out of my head i don t know why at work at home all i can think about is how crazy it feel when i m near you and i need you to make it stop lily he stop pacing and face me please make it stop just once that s all it ll take i swear my finger are digging into the skin of my arm a i watch him he s still panting a little and his eye are still frantic but he s looking at me pleadingly when is the last time you ve had sleep i ask him he roll his eye like he s frustrated that i m not getting it i just got off a forty eight hour shift he say dismissively focus lily i nod and replay his word in my head if i didn t know better i d almost think he wa i inhale a calming breath ryle i say carefully did you seriously just knock on twenty nine door so you could tell me that the thought of me is making your life hell and i should have sex with you so that you ll never have to think of me again are you kidding me right now he fold his lip together and after about five second of thought he slowly nod his head well yeah but it sound way worse when you say it i release an exasperated laugh that s because it s ridiculous ryle he bite his bottom lip and look around the room like he suddenly want to escape i open the door and motion for him to walk out he doesn t his eye fall to my foot your ankle look good he say how doe it feel i roll my eye better i wa able to help allysa at the store for the f irst time today he nod and then make like he s walking toward the door to leave but a soon a he reach me he spin toward me and slap his palm against the door on either side of my head i gasp at both his proximity and his persistence please he say i shake my head even though my body is starting to trade side and beg my mind to cave to him i m really good at it lily he say with a grin you ll barely even have to do any work i try not to laugh but his determination is a endearing a it is annoying goodnight ryle his head drop between his shoulder and he shake it back and forth he push off the door and stand up straight he half turn heading for the hallway but then suddenly drop to his knee in front of me he wrap his arm around my waist please lily he say through self deprecating laughter please have sex with me he s looking up at me with puppy dog eye and a pathetic hopeful grin i want you so so bad and i swear once you have sex with me you ll never hear from me again i promise there s something about a neurosurgeon literally on his knee begging for sex that doe me in that s pretty pathetic get up i say pushing his arm away from me you re embarrassing yourself he slowly stand up dragging his hand up the door on either side of me until he ha me caged in between his arm is that a yes his chest is barely touching mine and i hate how good it feel to be wanted this much i should be turned off by it but i can hardly breathe when i look at him especially when he ha this suggestive smile on his face i don t feel sexy right now ryle i worked all day i m exhausted i smell like sweat and probably taste like dust if you give me a little while to shower first i might feel sexy enough to have sex with you he s nodding feverishly before i m even finished speaking shower take all the time you need i ll wait i push him away from me and close the front door he follows me to the bedroom and i tell him to wait on the bed for me luckily i cleaned my bedroom last night normally i have clothes lying around everywhere book piled up on my nightstand shoe and bra that don t quite make it to my closet but tonight it s clean my bed is even made up complete with the ugly quilted throw pillow my grandmother passed down to every person in our family i make a quick glance around the room just to make sure nothing embarrassing will catch his eye he take a seat on my bed and i watch a he scan the room i stand in the doorway to my bathroom and try to give him one last out you say this will make it stop but i m warning you right now ryle i m like a drug if you have sex with me tonight it s only going to make thing worse for you but once is all you re getting i refuse to become one of the many girl you use to how did you word it that night satisfy your need he lean back on his elbow you aren t that kind of girl lily and i m not the kind of guy who need someone more than once we have nothing to worry about i close the door behind me wondering how in the hell this guy talked me into this it s the scrub the scrub are my weakness it ha nothing to do with him i wonder if there s a way he could leave them on during the sex i ve never taken more than half an hour to get ready but it s almost an hour before i m finished in the bathroom i shaved more part of me than wa probably necessary and then spent a good twenty minute having a freak out and had to talk myself out of opening the door and telling him to leave but now that my hair is dry and i m cleaner than i ve ever been i think i might be able to do this i can totally have a one night stand i m twenty three year old i open the door and he s still there on my bed i m a little disappointed to see that his scrub top is on the floor but i don t see his pant so he must still be wearing them he s under the cover though so i can t tell i close the door behind me and wait for him to roll over and look at me but he doesn t i take a few step closer and that s when i notice he s snoring not just a light oh i just fell asleep snore it s a middle of rem sleep kind of snore ryle i whisper he doesn t even budge when i shake him you ve got to be kidding me i drop down onto the bed not even caring if i wake him i just spent an entire hour getting ready for him after busting my as today and this is how he treat this night i can t be mad at him though especially seeing how peaceful he look i can t imagine working a forty eight hour shift plus my bed is really comfortable it s so comfortable it could make a person fall right back to sleep after a full night of rest i should have warned him about that i check the time on my phone and it s almost p m i put the phone on silent and then lie down next to him his phone is on the pillow next to his head so i grab it and swipe up the camera option i hold his phone above u and make sure my cleavage look good and pushed together i snap a picture so he ll at least see what he missed out on i turn off the light and laugh to myself because i m falling asleep next to a half naked man that i ve never even kissed i can feel his finger trailing up my arm before i even open my eye i force back a tired smile and pretend i m still sleeping his finger trail over my shoulder and stop at my collarbone just before they reach my neck i have a small tattoo there that i got in college it s a simple outline of a heart that s slightly open at the top i can feel his finger circle around the tattoo and then he lean forward and press his lip against it i squeeze my eye shut even tighter lily he whisper wrapping an arm around my waist i moan a little trying to wake up and then roll onto my back so that i can look up at him when i open my eye he s staring down at me i can tell by the way the sunlight shine through my window and across his face that it s not even seven a m yet i am the most despicable man you ve ever met am i right i laugh and nod a little pretty damn close he smile and then brush my hair off my face he lean forward and press his lip to my forehead and i hate that he just did that now i ll be the one plagued with sleepless night because i want to put this memory on repeat i have to go he say i m really late but one i m sorry two i ll never do this again this is the last you ll hear from me i promise and three i m really sorry you have no idea i force a smile but i want to frown because i absolutely hated his number two i actually don t mind if he try this again but then i remind myself that we want two different thing from life and it s good that he fell asleep and we never even kissed because if i would have had sex with him while he wa wearing scrub i would have been the one showing up at his door on my knee begging for more this is good rip the band aid off and let him leave have a nice life ryle i wish you all the success in the world he doesn t respond to my goodbye he silently stare down at me with somewhat of a frown and then say yeah you too lily then he roll away from me and stand up i can t even look at him right now so i roll onto my side so that my back is to him i listen a he put his shoe on and then reach for his phone there s a long pause before he move again and i know it s because he wa staring at me i squeeze my eye shut until i hear the slam of the front door my face immediately grows warm and i refuse to allow myself to mope i force myself off the bed i have work to do i can t be upset that i m not enough to make a guy want to remap all of his life goal besides i have my own life goal to worry about now and i m really excited about them so much so that i really don t have time for a guy in my life anyway no time nope busy girl here i am a brave and bold businesswoman with zero fuck to give for men in scrub chapter six it s been fifty three day since ryle walked out of my apartment that morning which mean it s been fifty three day since i ve heard from him but that s okay because for the last fifty three day i ve been too busy to really give him much thought a i prepared for this moment ready allysa say i nod and she flip the sign to open and we both hug and squeal like little kid we rush around the counter and wait for our first customer it s a soft opening so i haven t really done a marketing push yet but we just want to make sure there aren t any kink before our grand opening it s really pretty in here allysa say admiring our hard work i look around u bursting with pride of course i want to succeed but at this point i m not even sure if that matter i had a dream and i busted my as to

terribly wrong my very first customer is none other than ryle kincaid he stop when the door close behind him and he look around in awe what he say turning in a circle how in the he look over at me and allysa this is incredible it doesn t even look like the same building okay maybe i m fine with him being the first customer it take him a few minute to actually make it to the counter because he can t stop touching thing and looking at thing when he f inally doe reach u allysa run around the counter and hug him isn t it beautiful she say she wave her hand in my direction it wa all her idea all of it i just helped with the dirty work ryle laugh i find it hard to believe that your pinterest skill didn t play a little part i nod she s being modest her skill were half of what brought this vision to life ryle smile at me and it might a well have been a knife to the chest because ouch he slap his hand on the counter and say am i the first official customer allysa hand him one of our flyer you have to actually buy something to be considered a customer ryle glance over the flyer and then set it back down on the counter he walk to one of the display and grab a vase full of purple lily i want these he say setting them on the counter i smile wondering if he realizes he just picked lily kind of ironic do you want u to deliver them somewhere allysa say you guy deliver allysa and i don t i reply we have a delivery driver on standby we weren t sure if we d actually need him today are you actually buying these for a girl allysa asks she s just prying into her brother s love life like a sister would naturally do but i catch myself stepping closer to her so i can hear his answer better i am he say his eye meet mine and he add i don t think about her very much though hardly ever allysa grab a card and slide it to him poor girl she say you are such a dick she tap her finger on the card write your message to her on the front and the address you want them delivered to on the back i watch him a he bend over the card and writes on both side i know i don t have a right but i m brimming with jealousy are you bringing this girl to my birthday party friday allysa asks him i watch his reaction closely he just shake his head and without looking up he say no are you going lily i can t tell by his voice alone if he s hoping i ll be there or hoping i won t considering the stress i seem to cause him i m guessing it s the latter i haven t decided yet she ll be there allysa say answering for me she look at me and narrow her eye you re coming to my party whether you like it or not if you don t show up i ll quit when ryle is finished writing he tuck the card into the envelope attached to the flower allysa ring up his total and he pay in cash he look at me while he s counting out his money lily do you know that it s custom for a new business to frame the first dollar they make i nod of course i know that he know i know that he s just rubbing it in my face that his dollar will be the one framed on my wall for the life of this store i almost encourage allysa to give him a refund but this is business i have to leave my wounded pride out of it once he ha his receipt in hand he tap his fist on the counter to get my attention he dip his head a little and with a genuine smile he say congratulation lily he turn and walk out of the store a soon a the door close behind him allysa is grabbing for the envelope who in the hell is he sending flower to she say a she pull the card out ryle doesn t send flower she read the front of the card out loud make it stop holy shit she stare at it for a moment repeating the phrase make it stop what in the hell doe that even mean she asks i can t take it another second i grab the card from her and flip it over she lean over and read the back of it with me he is such an idiot she say with a laugh he wrote the address to our floral shop on the back she take the card out of my hand wow ryle just bought me flower not just any flower he bought me a bouquet of lily allysa pick up her phone i ll text him and tell him he screwed up she shoot him a text and then laugh a she stare at the flower how can a neurosurgeon be such an idiot i can t stop grinning i m relieved she s staring at the flower and not at me or she may put two and two together i ll keep them in my office until we figure out where he intended for them to go i scoop up the vase and whisk away my flower chapter seven stop fidgeting devin say i m not fidgeting he loop his arm through mine a he walk me toward the elevator yes you are and if you pull that top up over your cleavage one more time it ll defeat the whole purpose of your little black dress he grab my top and yank it back down and then proceeds to reach inside to adjust my bra devin i slap his hand away and he laugh relax lily i ve touched way better boob than yours and i m still gay yeah but i bet those boob were attached to people you probably hang out with more than once every six month devin laugh true but that s half your fault you re the one who left u high and dry to play with flower devin wa one of my favorite people at the marketing firm i worked at but we weren t close enough to where we actively became friend outside of work he stopped by the floral shop this afternoon and allysa took to him almost immediately she begged him to come to the party with me and since i didn t really want to show up alone i ended up begging him to come too i smooth my hand over my hair and try to catch a glimpse of my reflection in the elevator wall why are you so nervous he asks i m not nervous i just hate showing up to place where i don t know anyone devin smirk knowingly and then say what s his name i release a pent up breath am i that transparent ryle he s a neurosurgeon and he want to have sex with me really really bad how do you know he want to have sex with you because he literally got down on his knee and said please lily please have sex with me devin raise an eyebrow he begged i nod it wasn t a pathetic a it sound he s usually more composed the elevator ding and the door begin to open i can hear music pouring from down the hallway devin take both of my hand in his and say so what s the plan do i need to make this guy jealous no i say shaking my head that wouldn t be right but ryle doe make it a point every time he see me to tell me he hope he never see me again maybe just a little i say scrunching up my nose a smidge devin pop his jaw and say consider it done he put his hand on my lower back a he walk me out of the elevator there s only one visible door in the hallway so we make our way over and ring the doorbell why is there only one door he say she owns the whole top floor he chuckle and she work for you damn your life just keep getting more and more interesting the door begin to open and i m extremely relieved to see allysa standing in front of me there s music and laughter pouring out of the apartment behind her she s holding a champagne glass in one hand and a riding crop in the other she see me staring at the riding crop with a confused look on my face so she toss it over her shoulder and grab my hand it s a long story she say laughing come in come in she pull me in and i squeeze devin s hand and drag him behind me she continues pulling u through a crowd of people until we reach the other side of the living room hey she say tugging on marshall s arm he turn around and smile at me then pull me in for a hug i glance behind him and around u but there s no sign of ryle maybe i got lucky and he got called in to work tonight marshall reach out for devin s hand and shake it hey man good to meet you devin wrap an arm around my waist i m devin he yell over the music i m lily s sexual partner i laugh and elbow him then lean in to his ear that s marshall wrong guy but nice effort allysa grab my arm and start to pull me away from devin marshall begin speaking to him and my hand is reaching out behind me a i m being pulled in the opposite direction you ll be fine devin yell i follow allysa into the kitchen where she shove a glass of champagne in my hand drink she say you deserve it i take a sip of the champagne but i can t even appreciate it now that i m getting a look at her industrial sized kitchen with two full stovetops and a fridge bigger than my apartment holy shit i whisper you actually live here she giggle i know she say and to think i didn t even have to marry him for money marshall had seven buck and drove a ford pinto when i fell in love with him doesn t he still drive a ford pinto she sigh yeah but we have a lot of good memory in that car gross she wiggle her eyebrow so devin is cute and probably more into marshall than me ah man she say that s a bummer i thought i wa playing matchmaker when i invited him to the party tonight the kitchen door open and devin walk in your husband is looking for you he say to allysa she twirl her way out of the kitchen giggling the whole time i really like her devin say she s great huh he lean against the island and say so i think i just met the beggar my heart flutter down my chest i think the neurosurgeon ha a better ring to it i take another sip of my champagne how do you know it wa him did he introduce himself he shake his head nah but he overheard marshall introducing me to someone a lily s date i thought the look he gave me wa going to set me on fire that s why i came in here i like you but i m not willing to die for you i laugh don t worry i m sure that death glare he gave you wa really his smile they re superimposed most of the time the door swing open again and i immediately stiffen but it s only a caterer i sigh with relief devin say lily like my name is a disappointment what you look like you re about to puke he say accusingly you really like him i roll my eye but then i let my shoulder drop and i fake cry i do devin i do i just don t want to he take my glass of champagne and down the remainder of it then lock his arm in mine again let s go mingle he say pulling me out of the kitchen against my will the room is even more crowded now there have to be more than a hundred people here i m not even sure i know that many people we walk around and work the room i stand back while devin doe most of the talking he know someone in common with every person he s met so far and after about half an hour of following him around i m convinced he s made it a personal game to find someone in common with everyone here the whole time i mingle with him my attention is half on him and half on the room searching for trace of ryle i don t see him anywhere and i begin to wonder if the guy devin saw wa even ryle to begin with well that s odd a woman say what do you suppose it is i look up and see that she s staring at a piece of art on the wall it look like a photograph blown up on canvas i tilt my head to inspect it the woman turn her nose up and say i don t know why anyone would bother turning that photograph into wall art it s awful it s so blurry you can t even tell what it is she walk away in a huff and i m relieved i mean it s a bit weird but who am i to judge allysa s taste what do you think his voice is low deep and right behind me i close my eye briefly and inhale a steadying breath before quietly exhaling hoping he doesn t notice his voice ha any effect on me whatsoever i like it i m not quite sure what it is but it s interesting your sister ha good taste he step around me so that he s at my side facing me he take a step closer until he s so close he brush my arm you brought a date he s asking it like it s a casual question but i know it isn t when i fail to respond he lean in until he s whispering in my ear he repeat himself but this time it isn t a question you brought a date i find the courage to look over at him and instantly wish i hadn t he s in a black suit that make the scrub look like child s play first i swallow the unexpected lump in my throat and then i say is it a problem that i brought a date i look away from him and back at the photograph hanging on the wall i wa trying to make thing easier on you you know just trying to make it stop he smirk and then down the rest of his wine how thoughtful of you lily he toss his empty wineglass toward a trash can in the corner of the room he make the shot but the glass shatters when it hit the bottom of the empty container i glance around me but no one saw what just happened when i look back at ryle he s halfway down a hallway he disappears into a room and i stand here looking at the picture again that s when i see it the picture is blurred so it wa hard to make out at first but i can recognize that hair from anywhere that s my hair it s hard to miss along with the marine grade polymer lounge chair i m lying on this is the picture he took on the rooftop the first night we met he must have had it blown up and distorted so no one would notice what it wa i bring my hand to my neck because my blood feel like it s bubbling it s really warm in here allysa appears at my side it s weird huh she say looking at the picture i scratch at my chest it s really hot in here i say don t you think she glance around the room is it i hadn t noticed but i m a little drunk i ll tell marshall to turn on the air she disappears again and the more i stare at the picture the angrier i get the man ha a picture of me hanging in the apartment he bought me flower he s giving me attitude because i brought a date to his sister s party he s acting like there s actually something between u and we ve never even kissed it all hit me at once the anger the irritation the half glass of champagne i had in the kitchen i m so mad i can t even think straight if the guy want to have sex with me so bad he shouldn t have fallen asleep if he doesn t want me to swoon he shouldn t buy me flower he shouldn t hang cryptic picture of me where he life all i want is fresh air i need fresh air luckily i know just where to f ind it moment later i burst through the door to the rooftop there are straggler from the party up here three of them seated on the patio furniture i ignore them and walk to the ledge with the good view and lean over it i suck in several deep breath and try to calm myself down i want to go downstairs and tell him to make up his damn mind but i know i need to have a clear head before i do that the air is cold and for some reason i blame that on ryle everything is his fault tonight all of it war famine gun violence it all somehow link back to ryle can we have a few minute alone i spin around and ryle is standing near the other guest immediately all three of them nod and begin to stand up to give u privacy i hold up my hand and say wait but none of them look at me it s not necessary really you don t have to leave ryle stand stoically with his hand in his pocket while one of the guest mutter it s fine we don t mind they begin to file back down the stairwell i roll my eye and spin back toward the ledge once i m alone with him doe everyone always do what you say i ask irritated he doesn t respond his footstep are slow and deliberate a he close in on me my heart begin to beat like it s on a speed date and i start scratching at my chest again lily he say from behind me i turn around and grip the ledge behind me with both hand his eye journey down to my cleavage a soon a they do i yank at the top of my dress so he can t see it and then i grip the ledge again he laugh and take another step closer we re almost touching now and my brain is mush it s pathetic i m pathetic i feel like you have a lot to say he say so i d like to give you the opportunity to speak your naked truth hah i say with a laugh are you sure about that he nod so i prepare to let him have it i push against his chest and make my way around him so that he s the one leaning against the ledge now i can t tell what you want ryle and every time i get to the point where i start to not give a shit you show up again out of the blue you show up at my work you show up at my apartment door you show up at party you i live here he say excusing the last one that piss me off even more i clench my fist ugh you re driving me crazy do you want me or do you not he stand up straight and take a step toward me oh i want you lily make no mistake about that i just don t want to want you my whole body sigh at that comment partly out of frustration and partly because everything he say make me shiver and i hate that i allow him to make me feel like this i shake my head you don t get it do you i say softening my voice i feel too defeated right now to keep yelling at him i like you ryle and knowing that you only want me for one night make me really really sad and maybe if this were a few month ago we could have had sex and it would have been fine you would have walked away and i could have easily moved on with my life but it s not a few month ago you waited too long and too many piece of me are invested in you now so please stop flirting with me stop hanging picture of me in your apartment and stop sending me flower because when you do those thing it doesn t feel good ryle it actually kind of hurt i feel deflated and exhausted and i m ready to leave he regard me silently and i respectfully give him time to make his rebuttal but he doesn t he just turn around lean over the ledge and stare down at the street like he didn t hear a single word i said i walk across the roof and open the door half expecting him to call out my name or ask me not to leave i get all the way back to the apartment before i finally lose all hope of that happening i push through the crowd and make it through three different room before i spot devin when he see the look on my face he just nod and begin to make his way across the room toward me ready to go he asks looping his arm through mine i nod yes so ready we find allysa in the main living room i tell her and marshall goodnight using the excuse that i m just exhausted from opening week and i d like to get some sleep before work tomorrow allysa give me a hug and walk u to the front door i ll be back on monday she say to me kissing me on the cheek happy birthday i say to her devin open the door but right before we step into the hallway i hear someone yell my name i turn around and ryle is pushing through the crowd on the other side of the room lily wait he yell still trying to make his way over to me my heart is erratic he s walking quickly stepping around people growing more frustrated with every person in his way he finally reach a break in the crowd and make eye contact with me again he hold my gaze a he march toward me he doesn t slow down allysa ha to step out of his way a he walk straight up to me at first i think he might kiss me or at least give a rebuttal to everything i said to him upstairs but instead he doe something i m not at all prepared for he scoop me up into his arm ryle i yell gripping him around the neck afraid he might drop me put me down he ha an arm wrapped under my leg and one under my back i need to borrow lily for the night he say to devin that okay i look at devin and shake my head wide eyed devin just smirk and say be my guest traitor ryle start to turn and walk back toward the living room i look at allysa a i pas her her eye are wide with confusion i m going to kill your brother i yell at her everyone in the entire room is staring now i m so embarrassed i just press my face against ryle s chest a he walk me down the hallway and into his bedroom once the door is shut behind u he slowly lower my foot back to the floor i immediately start to yell at him and try to push him out of the way of the bedroom door but he spin me and shove me against the door grabbing both of my wrist he press them against the wall above my head and say lily he s looking at me so intently i stop trying to fight him off of me and i hold my breath his chest is pressing against mine my back is pressed to the door and then his mouth is on mine warm pressure against my lip despite the strength behind them his lip are like silk i m shocked at the moan that rush through me and even more shocked when i part my lip and want more his tongue slide against mine and he release my wrist to grab my face his kiss grows deeper and i grasp at his hair pulling him closer feeling the kiss in my entire body both of u become a medley of moan and gasp a the kiss bring we need to talk lucy say she s sitting on the couch mascara streaked down her cheek oh shit i drop my purse and rush over to her a soon a i sit down next to her she start cry what s wrong did alex break up with you she start shaking her head and then i really start freaking out please don t say cancer i grab her hand and that s when i see it lucy you re engaged she nod i m sorry i know we still have six month left on the lease but he want me to move in with him i stare at her for a minute is that why she s cry because she want out of her lease she reach for a tissue and start dabbing at her eye i feel awful lily you re going to be all alone i m moving and you won t have anyone what the lucy um i ll be fine i promise she look up at me with hope in her expression really why in the world doe she have this impression of me i nod again yes i m not mad i m happy for you she throw her arm around me and hug me oh thank you lily she start giggling in between bout of tear when she release me she jump up and say i have to go tell alex he wa so worried you wouldn t let me out of my lease she grab her purse and shoe and disappears out the front door i lie back on the couch and stare up at the ceiling did she just play me i start laughing because until this moment i had no idea how much i ve been waiting for this to happen the whole place to myself what s even better is when i do decide to have sex with ryle we can have it over here all the time and not have to worry about being quiet the last time i spoke to ryle wa when i left his apartment on saturday we agreed on a trial run no commitment yet just a relationship feeler to see if it s something we both want it s now monday night and i m a little disappointed i haven t heard from him i gave him my phone number before we parted saturday but i don t really know texting etiquette especially for trial run regardless i m not texting him first i decide to occupy my time with teenage angst and ellen degeneres instead i m not about to wait around to be beckoned by a guy i m not even having sex with but i don t know why i assume that reading about the first guy i had sex with will somehow get my mind off the guy i m not having sex with dear ellen my great grandfather s name is elli my entire life i thought that wa a really cool name for such an old guy after he died i wa reading the obituary would you believe that elli wasn t even his real name his real name wa levi sampson and i had no idea i asked my grandmother where the name elli came from she said his initial were l s and everyone called him by his initial for so long they just started sounding them out over the year which is why they referred to him a elli i wa looking at your name just now and it made me think of that ellen is that even your real name you could be just like my great grandfather and using your initial a a disguise l n i m onto you ellen speaking of name do you think atlas is a weird name it is isn t it yesterday while i wa watching your show with him i asked him where he got his name from he said he didn t know without even thinking i told him he should ask his mother why she named him that he just looked over at me for a second and said it s a little too late for that i don t know what he meant by that i don t know if his mom died or if she gave him up for adoption we ve been friend for a few week now and i still don t really know anything about him or why he doesn t have a place to live i would just ask him but i m not sure if he really trust me yet he seems to have trust issue and i guess i can t blame him i m worried about him it started getting really cold this week and it s supposed to be even colder next week if he doesn t have electricity that mean he doesn t have a heater i hope he at least ha blanket do you know how awful i would feel if he froze to death pretty freaking awful ellen i ll find some blanket this week and give them to him lily dear ellen it s going to start snowing soon so i decided to harvest my garden today i had already pulled the radish so i just wanted to put some mulch and compost down which wouldn t have taken me long but atlas insisted on helping he asked me a lot of question about gardening and i liked that he seemed interested in my interest i showed him how to lay the compost and mulch to cover the ground so that the snow wouldn t do too much damage my garden is small compared to most garden maybe ten foot by twelve foot but it s all my dad will let me use of the backyard atlas covered the whole thing while i sat cross legged in the grass and watched him i wasn t being lazy he just took over and wanted to do it so i let him i can tell he s a hard worker i wonder if maybe keeping himself busy take his mind off of thing and that s why he always want to help me so much when he wa finished he walked over and dropped down next to me on the grass what made you want to grow thing he asked i glanced over at him and he wa sitting cross legged looking at me curiously i realized in that moment that he s probably the best friend i ve ever had and we barely know anything about each other i have friend at school but they re never allowed to come over to my house for obvious reason my mother is always worried something might happen with my father and word might get out about his temper i also never really get to go to other people s house but i m not sure why maybe my father doesn t want me staying over at friend house because i might witness how a good husband is supposed to treat his wife he probably want me to believe the way he treat my mother is normal atlas is the first friend i ve ever had that s ever been inside my house he s also the first friend to know how much i like to garden and now he s the first friend to ever ask me why i garden i reached down and pulled at a weed and started tearing it into little piece while i thought about his question when i wa ten my mother got me a subscription to a website called seed anonymous i said every month i would get an unmarked package of seed in the mail with instruction on how to plant them and care for them i wouldn t know what i wa growing until it came up out of the ground every day after school i d run straight to the backyard to see the progress it gave me something to look forward to growing thing felt like a reward i could feel atlas staring at me when he asked a reward for what i shrugged for loving my plant the right way plant reward you based on the amount of love you show them if you re cruel to them or neglect them they give you nothing but if you care for them and love them the right way they reward you with gift in the form of vegetable or fruit or flower i looked down at the weed i wa tearing apart in my hand and there wa barely an inch left of it i wadded it up between my finger and flicked it i didn t want to look over at atlas because i could still feel him staring so instead i just stared out over my mulch covered garden we re just alike he said my eye flicked to his me and you he shook his head no plant and human plant need to be loved the right way in order to survive so do human we rely on our parent from birth to love u enough to keep u alive and if our parent show u the right kind of love we turn out a better human overall but if we re neglected his voice grew quiet almost sad he wiped his hand on his knee trying to get some of the dirt off if we re neglected we end up homeless and incapable of anything meaningful his word made my heart feel like the mulch he had just laid out i didn t even know what to say to that doe he really think that about himself he acted like he wa about to get up but before he did i said his name he sat back down in the grass i pointed at the row of tree that lined the fence to the left of the yard you see that tree over there in the middle of the row of tree wa an oak tree that stood taller than all the rest of the tree atlas glanced over at it and dragged his eye all the way up to the top of the tree it grew on it own i said most plant do need a lot of care to survive but some thing like tree are strong enough to do it by just relying on themselves and nobody else i had no idea if he knew what i wa trying to say without me coming out and saying it but i just wanted him to know that i thought he wa strong enough to survive whatever wa going on in his life i didn t know him well but i could tell he wa resilient way more than i would ever be if i were in his situation his eye were glued to the tree it wa a long time before he even blinked when he finally did he just nodded a little and looked down at the grass i thought with the way his mouth twitched that he wa about to frown but instead he actually smiled a little seeing that smile made my heart feel like i had just startled it right out of a dead sleep we re just alike he said repeating himself from earlier plant and human i asked he shook his head no me and you i gasped ellen i hope he didn t notice but i definitely sucked in a rush of air because what the heck wa i supposed to say to that i just sat there really awkward and quiet until he stood up he turned like he wa about to walk home atlas wait he glanced back down at me i pointed at his hand and said you might want to take a quick shower before you go back compost is made from cow manure he lifted his hand and looked down at them and then he looked down at his compost covered clothes cow manure seriously i grinned and nodded he laughed a little and then before i knew it he wa on the ground next to me wiping his hand all over me we were both laughing a he reached to the bag next to u and stuck his hand inside then smeared it down my arm ellen i am confident that the next sentence i am about to write ha never been written or spoken aloud before when he wa wiping that cow shit on me it wa quite possibly the most turned on i have ever been after a few minute we were both lying on the ground breathing hard still laughing he finally stood up and pulled me to my foot knowing he couldn t waste minute if he wanted a shower before my parent came home once he wa in the shower i washed my hand in the sink and just stood there wondering what he meant earlier when he said we were just alike wa it a compliment it sure felt like one wa he saying that he thought i wa strong too because i certainly didn t feel strong most of the time in that moment just thinking about him made me feel weak i wondered what i wa going to do about the way i wa starting to feel when i wa around him i also wondered how long i can keep hiding him from my parent and how long he ll be staying at that house winter in maine are unbearably cold and he won t survive without a heater or blanket i gathered myself and went in search of all the spare blanket i could find i wa going to give them to him when he got out of the shower but it wa already f ive and he left in a hurry i ll give them to him tomorrow lily dear ellen harry connick jr is freaking hilarious i m not sure if you ve ever had him on your show because i hate to admit i ve probably missed an episode or two since you ve been on the air but if you ve never had him you should actually have you ever watched late night with conan o brien he ha this guy named andy who sits on the couch for every episode i wish harry could sit on your couch for every episode he just ha the best one liner and the two of you toget her would be epic i just want to say thank you i know that you don t have a show on tv for the sole purpose of making me laugh but sometimes it feel that way sometimes my life just make me feel like i ve lost the ability to laugh or smile but then i turn on your show and no matter what mood i m in when i turn on the tv i always feel better by the time your show is over so yeah thanks for that i know you probably want an update on atlas and i ll give you one in a second but first i need to tell you about what happened yesterday my mother is a teaching assistant over at brimer elementary it s a bit of a drive and that s why she never get home until around five o clock my dad work two mile from here so he s always home right after five we have a garage but only one car can fit in it because of all my dad s stuff my dad keep his car in the garage and my mom keep her car in the driveway well yesterday my mom got home a little bit early atlas wa still at the house and we were almost finished watching your show when i heard the garage door start to open he ran out the back door and i rushed around the living room cleaning up our soda can and snack it had started snowing really hard around lunchtime yesterday and my mother had a lot of stuff to carry in so she pulled up in the garage so she could bring it all in through the kitchen door it wa work stuff and a few grocery i wa helping her bring everything inside when my dad pulled up in the driveway he started honking his horn because he wa mad that my mom wa parked in the garage i guess he didn t want to have to get out of his car in the snow that s the only thing i can think of that would make him want her to move her car right then and there instead of just waiting until she wa f inished unloading it come to think of it why doe my father always get the garage you would think a man wouldn t want the woman he love to get the shittier parking spot anyway my mother got that real scared look in her eye when he started honking and she told me to take all her stuff to the table while she moved her car out i m not sure what happened when she went back outside i heard a crash and then i heard her scream so i ran to the garage thinking maybe she had slipped on ice ellen i don t even want to describe what happened next i m still a little shocked by the whole thing i opened the garage door and didn t see my mom i just saw my dad behind the car doing something i took a step closer and realized why i couldn t see my mom he had her pushed down on the hood with his hand around her throat he wa choking her ellen i might cry just thinking about it he wa yelling at her staring down at her with so much hatred something about not having respect for how hard he work i don t know why he wa mad really because all i could hear wa her silence while she struggled to breathe the next few minute are a blur but i know i started screaming at him i jumped on his back and i wa hitting him on the side of his head then i wasn t i don t really know what happened but i m guessing he threw me off of him i just remembered one second i wa on his back and the next second i wa on the ground and my forehead hurt like you wouldn t believe my mom wa sitting next to me holding my head and telling me she wa sorry i looked around for my dad but he wasn t there he d gotten into his car and drove off after i hit my head my mom gave me a rag and told me to hold it to my head because it wa bleeding and then she helped me to her car and drove me to the hospital on the way there she only said one thing to me when they ask you what happened tell them you slipped on the ice when she said that i just looked out my window and started cry because i thought for sure this wa the final straw that she would leave him now that he had hurt me that wa the moment i realized that she d never leave him i felt so defeated but i wa too scared to say anything to her about it i had to get nine stitch in my forehead i m still not sure what i hit my head on but it doesn t really matter the fact is my father wa the reason i wa hurt and he didn t even stay and check on me he just left u both there on the f loor of the garage and left i got home really late last night and fell right to sleep because they had given me some kind of pain pill this morning when i walked to the bus i tried not to look directly at atlas so he wouldn t see my forehead i had fixed my hair so that you couldn t really see it and he didn t notice right away when we sat down next to each other on the bus our hand touched when we were putting our stuff on the floor his hand were like ice ellen ice that s when i realized that i forgot to give him the blanket i had pulled out for him yesterday because my mother got home sooner than i expected the incident in the garage sort of took over all my thought and i completely forgot about him it had snowed and iced all night and he had been over there at that house in the dark all by himself and now he wa so cold i didn t know how he wa even functioning i grabbed both of his hand in mine and said atlas you re freezing he didn t say anything i just started rubbing his hand in mine to warm them up i laid my head on his shoulder and then i did the most embarrassing thing i just started to cry i don t cry very much but i wa still so upset by what happened yesterday and then i wa feeling so guilty that i forgot to take him blanket and it all hit me right there on the ride to school he didn t say anything he just pulled his hand from mine so i d stop rubbing them and then he laid his hand on top of mine we just sat there like that the whole ride to school with our head leaned together and his hand on top of mine i might have thought it wa sweet if it wasn t so sad on the ride home from school is when he finally noticed my head honestly i had forgotten about it no one at school even asked me about it and when he sat down next to me on the bus i wasn t even trying to hide it with my hair he looked right at me and said what happened to your head i didn t know what to say to him i just touched it with my finger and then looked out the window i ve been trying to get him to trust me more in hope he would tell me why he doesn t have a place to live so i didn t want to lie to him i just didn t want to tell him the truth either when the bus started moving he said yesterday after i left your house i heard something going on over there i heard yelling i heard you scream and then i saw your father leave i wa going to come check on you to make sure everything wa okay but a i wa walking over i saw you leaving in the car with your mother he must have heard the fight in the garage and saw her leaving to take me to get the stitch i couldn t believe he came over to our house do you know what my dad would do to him if he saw him wearing his clothes i got so worried for him because i don t think he know what my father is capable of i looked at him and said atlas you can t do that you can t come to my house when my parent are home atlas got real quiet and then said i heard you scream lily he said it like me being in danger trumped anything else i felt bad because i know he wa just trying to help but that would have made thing so much worse i fell i said to him a soon a i said it i felt bad for lying and to be honest he looked a little disappointed in me because i think we both knew in that moment that it wasn t a simple a a fall then he pulled up the sleeve of his shirt and held out his arm ellen my stomach dropped it wa so bad all over his arm he had these small scar some of the scar looked just like someone had stuck a cigarette to his arm and held it there he twisted his arm around so i could see that it wa on the other side too i used to fall a lot too lily then he pulled his shirtsleeve down and didn t say anything else for a second i wanted to tell him it wasn t like that that my dad never hurt me and that he wa just trying to get me off of him but then i realized i d be using the same excuse my mom us i felt a little embarrassed that he know what go on at my house i spent the whole rest of the bus ride looking out the window because i didn t know what to say to him when we got home my mom s car wa there in the driveway of course not the garage that meant atlas couldn t come over and watch your show with me i wa gon na tell him i would bring him blanket later but when he got off the bus he didn t even tell me bye he just started walking down the street like he wa mad it s dark now and i m waiting on my parent to go to sleep but in a little while i m gon na take him some blanket lily dear ellen i m in way over my head do you ever do thing you know are wrong but are somehow also right i don t know how to put it in simpler term than that i mean i m only fifteen and i certainly shouldn t have boy spending the night in my bedroom but if a person know someone need a place to stay isn t it that person s responsibility a a human to help them last night after my parent went to sleep i snuck out the back door to take atlas those blanket i took a flashlight with me because it wa dark it wa still snowing really hard so by the time i made it to that house i wa freezing i beat on the back door and a soon a he opened it i pushed past him to get out of the cold only i didn t get out of the cold somehow it felt even colder inside that old house i still had my flashlight on and i shined it around the living room and kitchen there wasn t anything in there ellen no couch no chair no mattress i handed the blanket off to him and kept looking around me there wa a big hole in the roof over the kitchen and wind and snow were just pouring in when i shined my light around the living room i saw his stuff in one of the corner his backpack plus the backpack i d given him there wa a little pile of other stuff i d given him like some of my dad s clothes and then there were two towel on the floor one i guess he laid on and one he covered up with i put my hand over my mouth because i wa so horrified he d been there living like that for week atlas put his hand on my back and tried to walk me back out the door you shouldn t be over here lily he said you could get in trouble that s when i grabbed his hand and said you shouldn t be here either i started to pull him out the front door with me but he yanked his hand back that s when i said you can sleep on my floor tonight i ll keep my bedroom door locked you can t sleep here atlas it s too cold and you ll get pneumonia and die he looked like he didn t know what to do i m sure the thought of being caught in my bedroom wa just a scary a getting pneumonia and dying he looked back at his spot in the living room and then he just nodded his head once and said okay so you tell me ellen wa i wrong letting him sleep in my room last night it doesn t feel wrong it felt like the right thing to do but i sure would get in a lot of trouble if we had been caught he slept on the floor so it s not like it wa anything more than me just giving him somewhere warm to sleep i did learn a little more about him last night after i snuck him in the back door and to my room i locked my door and made a pallet for him on the floor next to my bed i set the alarm for a m and told him he d have to get up and leave before my parent woke up since sometimes my mom wake me up in the morning i crawled in my bed and scooted over to the edge of it so i could look down at him while we talked for a little while i asked him how long he thought he might stay there and he said he didn t know that s when i asked him how he ended up there my lamp wa still on and we were whispering but he got real quiet when i said that he just stared up at me with his hand behind his head for a moment then he said i don t know my real dad he never had anything to do with me it s always just been me and my mom but she got remarried about five year ago to a guy who never really liked me much we fought a lot when i turned eighteen a few month ago we got in a big fight and he kicked me out of the house he took a deep breath like he didn t want to tell me any more but then he started talking again i ve been staying with a friend of mine and his family since then but his dad got a transfer to colorado and they moved they couldn t take me with them of course his parent were just being nice by letting me stay with them and i knew that so i told them i talked to my mom and that i wa moving back home the day they left i didn t have anywhere to go so i went back home and told my mom i d like to move back in until i graduated she wouldn t let me said it would upset my stepfather he turned his head and looked at the wall so i just wandered around for a few day until i saw that house figured i would just stay there until something better came along or until i graduated i m signed up to go to the marine come may so i m just trying to hang on until then may is six month away ellen six i had tear in my eye when he finished telling me all that i asked him why he didn t just ask someone if they could help him he said he tried but it s harder for an adult than a kid and he s already eighteen he said someone gave him a number for some shelter who might help him there were three shelter in a twenty mile radius of our town but two of them were for battered woman the other one wa a homeless shelter but they only had a few bed and it wa too far away for him to walk there if he wanted to go to school every day plus you have to wait in a long line to try and get a bed he said he tried it once but he feel safer in that old house than he did at the shelter like the na ve girl i am when it come to situation like his i said but aren t there other option can t you just tell the school counselor what your mom did he shook his head and said he s too old for foster care he s eighteen so his mother can t get in trouble for not allowing him to go back home he said he called about getting food stamp last week but he didn t have a ride or money to get to his appointment not to mention he doesn t have a car so he can t very well find a job he said he s been looking though after he leaf my house in the afternoon he go and applies at place but he doesn t have an address or a phone number to put down on the application so that make it harder for him i swear ellen every question i threw at him he had an answer for it s like he s tried everything not to be stuck in the situation he s in but there isn t enough help out there for people like him i got so mad at his whole situation i told him he wa crazy for wanting to go into the military i wasn t so much whispering when i said why in the heck would you want to serve a country that ha allowed you to end up in this kind of situation you know what he said next ellen his eye grew sad and he said it s not this country s fault my mother doesn t give a shit about me then he reached up and turned off my lamp goodnight lily he said i didn t sleep much after that i wa too mad i m not even sure who i m mad at i just kept thinking about our country and the whole world and how screwed up it is that people don t do more for each other i don t know when human started only looking out for themselves maybe it s always been this way it made me wonder how many people out there were just like atlas it made me wonder if there were other kid at our school who might be homeless i go to school every day and internally complain about it most of the time but i ve never once thought that school might be the only home some kid have it s the only place atlas can go and know he ll have food i ll never be able to respect rich people now knowing they willingly choose to spend their money on materialistic thing rather than using it to help other people no offense ellen i know you re rich but i guess i m not referring to people like you i ve seen all the stuff you ve done for others on your show and all the charity you support but i know there are a lot of rich people out there who are selfish hell there are even selfish poor people and selfish middle class people look at my parent we aren t rich but we certainly aren t too poor to help other people yet i don t think my dad ha ever done anything for a charity i remember one time we were walking into a grocery store and an old man wa ringing a bell for the salvation army i asked my dad if we could give him some money and he told me no that he work hard for his money and he wasn t about to let me give it away he said it isn t his fault that other people don t want to work he spent the whole time we were in the grocery store telling me about how people take advantage of the government and until the government stop helping those people by giving them handout the problem won t ever go away ellen i believed him that wa three year ago and all this time i thought homeless people were homeless because they were lazy or drug addict or just didn t want to work like other people but now i know that s not true sure some of what he said wa true to an extent but he wa using the worst case scenario not everyone is homeless because they choose to be they re homeless because there isn t enough help to go around and people like my father are the problem instead of helping others people use the worst case scenario to excuse their own selfishness and greed i ll never be like that i swear to you when i grow up i m going to do everything i can to help other people i ll be like you ellen just probably not a rich lily chapter nine i drop the journal on my chest i m surprised to feel tear running down my cheek every time i pick up this journal i think i ll be fine that it all happened so long ago and i won t still feel what i felt back then i m such a sap it give me this longing to hug so many people from my past especially my mother because for the past year i haven t really thought about everything she had to go through before my father died i know it probably still hurt her i grab my phone to call her and look at the screen there are four missed text from ryle my heart immediately skip i can t believe i had it on silent then i roll my eye annoyed with myself because i should not be this excited ryle are you asleep ryle i guess so ryle lily ryle the sad face wa

go to the bathroom and check my face good enough i run to the front door and open it a soon a ryle make it up the stairwell he practically drag himself up the top step and then stop to rest when he finally reach my door he look so tired his eye are red and there are dark circle under them his arm slip around my waist and he pull me to him burying his face in my neck you smell so good he say i pull him inside the apartment are you hungry i can make you something to eat he shake his head a he wrestle out of his jacket so i skip the kitchen and head for the bedroom he follows me and then throw his jacket over the back of the chair he kick off his shoe and push them against the wall he s wearing scrub you look exhausted i say he smile and put his hand on my hip i am i just assisted in an eighteen hour surgery he bend down and kiss the heart tattoo on my collarbone no wonder he s exhausted how is that even possible i say eighteen hour he nod and then walk me to the side of the bed where he pull me down next to him we adjust ourselves until we re facing each other sharing a pillow yeah but it wa amazing groundbreaking they ll write about it in medical journal and i got to be there so i m not complaining i m just really tired i lean in and give him a peck on the mouth he brings his hand to the side of my head and pull back i know you re probably ready to have hot sweaty sex but i don t have the energy tonight i m sorry but i ve missed you and for some reason i sleep better when i sleep next to you is it okay that i m here i smile it s more than okay he lean in and kiss my forehead he grab my hand and then hold it between u on the pillow his eye close but i keep mine open and stare at him he ha the type of face that people shy away from because you could get lost in it and to think i get to look at this face all the time i don t have to be modest and look away because he s mine maybe this is a trial run i have to remember that after a minute he release my hand and begin to flex his finger i look down at his hand and wonder what that must be like to have to stand for so long and use your fine motor skill for eighteen hour straight i can t think of much else that would match that level of exhaustion i slide out of the bed and retrieve some lotion out of my bathroom i go back to the bed and sit cross legged next to him i squirt some lotion on my hand and then pull his arm to my lap he open his eye and look up at me what are you doing he mumble shh go back to sleep i say i press my thumb into the palm of his hand and rotate them upward and then out his eye fall shut and he groan into the pillow i continue massaging his hand for about f ive minute before switching to his other hand he keep his eye closed the whole time when i m finished with his hand i roll him onto his stomach and straddle his back he assist me in pulling off his shirt but his arm are like noodle i massage his shoulder and his neck and his back and his arm when i m finished i roll off of him and lie down beside him i m running my finger through his hair and massaging his scalp when he open his eye lily he whisper looking at me sincerely you just might be the best thing that s ever happened to me those word wrap around me like a warm blanket i don t know what to say in response he lift a hand and gently cup my cheek and i feel his stare deep in my stomach slowly he lean forward and press his lip to mine i expect a peck but he doesn t pull back the tip of his tongue slide across my lip parting them softly his mouth is so warm i moan a his kiss grows deeper he roll me onto my back and then drag his hand down my body straight to my hip he move closer sliding his hand down my thigh he push against me and a surge of heat shoot inside me i grab a f istful of his hair and whisper against his mouth i think we ve waited long enough i would very much like for you to fuck me now he practically growl with a renewed sense of energy and begin to pull my shirt off it becomes an interlude of hand and moan and tongue and sweat i feel like this is the first time i ve ever been touched by a man the few who came before him were all boy nervous hand and timid mouth but ryle is all confidence he know exactly where to touch me and exactly how to kiss me the only time he s not giving my body his undivided attention is when he reach to the floor and fish a condom out of his wallet once he s back under the cover and the condom is in place he doesn t even hesitate he take me brazenly in one swift thrust and i gasp into his mouth every muscle in me tensing his mouth is fierce and needy kissing me everywhere he can reach i grow so dizzy i can do nothing but succumb to him he s unapologetic in the way he fuck me his hand come between my headboard and the top of my head a he push harder and harder the bed crashing against the wall with every push my fingernail dig into the skin of his back a he buries his face against my neck ryle i whisper oh god i say ryle i scream and then i bite down on his shoulder to muffle every sound that come after it my whole body feel it from my head to my toe and back up again i m afraid i might literally pas out for a moment so i tighten my leg around him and he tense jesus lily his body ripple with tremor and he shove against me one last time he groan stilling himself on top of me his body jerk with his release and my head fall back against the pillow it s a full minute before either of u is able to move and even then we choose not to he press his face into the pillow and let out a deep sigh i can t he pull back and look down at me his eye are full of something i don t know what he press his lip to mine and then say you were so right about what he slowly pull out of me coming down on his forearm you

back he hold my gaze for a moment and it get really quiet way too quiet there s so much to say but neither of u even know where to start the smile leaf his eye for a moment and then he motion toward the door you should probably get back to your company he say i ll look you up sometime you said park plaza right i nod he nod the door swing open and a woman walk in holding a toddler she move between u which put even more distance between u i take a step toward the door but he remains in the same spot before i walk out i turn back to him and smile it wa really good to see you atlas he smile a little but it doesn t touch his eye yeah you too lily i m mostly quiet for the rest of the meal i m not sure ryle or my mother even notice though because she s having no issue firing question after question at him he take it like a champ he s very charming with my mother in all the right way unexpectedly running into atlas tonight put such a wrinkle in my emotion but by the end of dinner ryle ha smoothed them back out again my mother take her napkin and wipe her mouth then point at me new favorite restaurant she say incredible ryle nod i agree i need to bring allysa here she love trying new restaurant the food really is good but the last thing i need is for either of these two to want to come back here it wa okay i say he pay for our meal of course and then insists we walk my mother to her car i can already tell she ll be calling me about him tonight simply by the prideful look on her face once she s gone ryle walk me to my car i requested an uber so you wouldn t have to go out of your way to take me home we have approximately he look down at his phone one and a half minute to make out i laugh he wrap his arm around me and kiss my neck first and then my cheek i would invite myself over but i have an early surgery tomorrow and i m sure my patient would appreciate it if i didn t spend the majority of the night inside you i kiss him back both disappointed and relieved he s not coming over i have a grand opening in a few day i should probably sleep too when s your next day off he say never when s yours never i shake my head we re doomed there s just too much drive and success between the two of u that mean the honeymoon phase will last until we re eighty he say i ll come to your grand opening friday and then the four of u will go out and celebrate a car pull up beside u and he wrap his hand in my hair and kiss me goodbye your mother is wonderful by the way thank you for letting me come to dinner he back away and climb inside the car i watch a it pull out of the parking lot i have a really good feeling about that man i smile and turn toward my car but throw a hand up to my chest and gasp when i see him atlas is standing at the rear of my car sorry wasn t trying to scare you i blow out a breath well you did i lean against the car and atlas stay where he is three foot away from me he look out at the street so who s the lucky guy he s my voice falter this is all so weird my chest is still constricted and my stomach is flipping and i can t tell if it s leftover nerve from kissing ryle or if it s the presence of atlas his name is ryle we met about a year ago i instantly regret saying we met that long ago it make it sound like ryle and i have been dating that long and we aren t even officially dating what about you married have a girlfriend i m not sure if i m asking to extend the conversation he started or if i m genuinely curious i do actually her name is cassie we ve been together almost a year now heartburn i think i have heartburn a year i place my hand on my chest and nod that s good you seem happy doe he seem happy i have no idea yeah well i m really glad i got to see you lily he turn around to walk away but then spin and face me again his hand shoved in his back pocket i will say i kind of wish this could have happened a year ago i wince at his word trying not to let them penetrate he turn and walk back toward the restaurant i fumble with my key and hit the button to unlock the car i slide in and pull the door shut gripping the steering wheel for whatever reason a huge tear fall down my cheek a huge pathetic what the hell is this wetness tear i swipe at it and push the button to start my car i didn t expect to feel this much hurt after seeing him but it s good this happened for a reason my heart needed closure so i can give it to ryle but maybe i couldn t do that until this happened this is good yes i m cry but it ll feel better this is just human nature healing an old wound to prepare for a fresh new layer that s all chapter eleven i curl up in my bed and stare at it i m almost finished with it there aren t very many more entry i pick up the journal and place it on the pillow beside me i m not going to read you i whisper although if i read what s left i ll be finished having seen atlas tonight and knowing he ha a girlfriend and a job and more than likely a home is enough closure i need on that chapter and if i just f inish the damn journal i can put it back in the shoebox and never have to open it again i finally pick it up and roll onto my back ellen degeneres you are such a bitch dear ellen just keep swimming recognize that quote ellen it s what dory say to marlin in finding nemo just keep swimming swimming swimming i m not a huge fan of cartoon but i ll give you prop for that one i like cartoon that can make you laugh but also make you feel something after today i think that s my favorite cartoon because i ve been feeling like drowning lately and sometimes people need a reminder that they just need to keep swimming atlas got sick like really sick he s been crawling through my window and sleeping on the floor for a few night in a row now but last night i knew something wa wrong a soon a i looked at him it wa a sunday so i hadn t seen him since the night before but he looked awful his eye were bloodshot his skin wa pale and even though it wa cold his hair wa sweaty i didn t even ask if he wa feeling okay i already knew he wasn t i put my hand on his forehead and he wa so hot i almost yelled for my mother he said i ll be fine lily and then he started to make his pallet on the f loor i told him to wait there and then i went to the kitchen and poured him a glass of water i found some medicine in the cabinet it wa flu medicine and i wasn t even sure if that s what wa wrong with him but i made him take some anyway he laid there on the floor curled up into a ball when about half an hour later he said lily i think i m gon na need a trash can i jumped up and grabbed the trash can from under my desk and knelt down in front of him a soon a i set it down he hunched over it and started throwing up god i felt bad for him being so sick and not having a bathroom or a bed or a house or a mother all he had wa me and i didn t even know what to do for him when he wa finished i made him drink some water and then i told him to get on the bed he refused but i wasn t having it i put the trash can on the f loor next to the bed and made him move to the bed he wa so hot and shaking so bad i wa just scared to leave him on the f loor i laid down next to him and every hour for the next six hour he continued getting sick i kept having to take the trash can to the bathroom to empty it out i m not gon na lie it wa gross the grossest night i ve ever had but what else could i do he needed me to help him and i wa all he had when it came time for him to leave my room this morning i told him to go back to his house and i d be over to check on him before school i m surprised he even had the energy to crawl out of my window i left the trash can next to my bed and waited for my mom to come wake me up when she did she saw the trash can and immediately held her hand to my forehead lily are you okay i groaned and shook my head no i wa up all night sick i think it s over now but i haven t slept she picked up the trash can and told me to stay in bed that she d call the school and let them know i wasn t coming after she left for work i went and got atlas and told him he could stay with me at the house all day he wa still getting sick so i let him use my room to sleep i d check on him every half hour or so and finally around lunch he stopped throwing up he went and took a shower and then i made him some soup he wa too tired to even eat it i got a blanket and we both sat down on the couch and covered up together i don t know when i started feeling comfortable enough to snuggle up to him but it just felt right a few minute later he leaned over a little and pressed his lip against my collarbone right between my shoulder and my neck it wa a quick kiss and i don t think he meant for it to be romantic it wa more like a thank you gesture without using actual word but it made me feel all kind of thing it s been a few hour now and i keep touching that spot with my finger because i can still feel it i know it wa probably the worst day of his life ellen but it wa one of my favorite i feel really bad about that we watched finding nemo and when that part came up where marlin wa looking for nemo and he wa feeling really defeated dory said to him when life get you down do you wan na know what you ve got ta do just keep swimming just keep swimming just keep swimming swimming swimming atlas grabbed my hand when dory said that he didn t hold it like a boyfriend hold his girlfriend s hand he squeezed it like he wa saying that wa u he wa marlin and i wa dory and i wa helping him swim just keep swimming i whispered to him lily dear ellen i m scared so scared i like him a lot he s all i think about when we re together and i feel worried sick about him when we re not my life is beginning to revolve around him and that s not good i know but i can t help it and i don t know what to do about it and now he might leave he left after we finished watching finding nemo yesterday and then when my parent went to bed he crawled in my window last night he had slept in my bed the night before because he wa sick and i know i shouldn t have done it but i put his blanket in the washing machine right before i went to bed he asked where his pallet wa and i told him he d have to sleep on the bed again because i wanted to wash his blanket and make sure they were clean so he wouldn t get sick again for a minute it looked like he wa going to go back out the window but then he shut it and took off his shoe and crawled in the bed with me he wasn t sick anymore but when he laid down i thought maybe i had gotten sick because my stomach felt queasy but i wasn t sick i just always feel queasy when he s that close to me we were facing each other on the bed when he said when do you turn sixteen two more month i whispered we just kept staring at each other and my heart wa beating faster and faster when do you turn nineteen i asked just trying to make conversation so he couldn t hear how hard i wa breathing not until october he said i nodded i wondered why he wa curious about my age and it made me wonder what he thought about fifteen year old did he look at me like i wa just a little kid like a little sister i wa almost sixteen and two and a half year apart in age isn t that bad maybe when two people are fifteen and eighteen it might seem a little too far apart but once i turn sixteen i bet no one would even think twice about a two and a half year age difference i need to tell you something he said i held my breath not knowing what he wa going to say i got in touch with my uncle today my mom and i used to live with him in boston he told me once he get back from his work trip i can stay with him i should have been so happy for him in that moment i should have smiled and told him congratulation but i felt all of the immaturity of my age when i closed my eye and felt sorry for myself are you going i asked he shrugged i don t know i wanted to talk to you about it first he wa so close to me on the bed i could feel the warmth of his breath i also noticed he smelled like mint and it made me wonder if he us bottled water to brush his teeth before he come over here i always send him home every day with lot of water i brought my hand up to the pillow and started pulling at a feather sticking out of it when i got it all the way out i twisted it between my finger i don t know what to say atlas i m happy you have a place to stay but what about school i could finish down there he said i nodded it sounded like he already made up his mind when are you leaving i wondered how far away boston is it s probably a few hour but that s a whole world away when you don t own a car i don t know for sure that i am i dropped the feather back onto the pillow and brought my hand to my side what s stopping you your uncle is offering you a place to stay that s good right he tightened his lip together and nodded then he picked up the feather i d been playing with and he started twisting it between his finger he laid it back down on the pillow and then he did something i wasn t expecting he moved his finger to my lip and he touched them god ellen i thought i wa gon na die right then and there it wa the most i d ever felt inside my body at one time he kept his finger there for a few second and he said thank you lily for everything he moved his finger up and through my hair and then he leaned forward and planted a kiss on my forehead i wa breathing so hard i had to open my mouth to catch more air i could see his chest moving just a hard a mine wa he looked down at me and i watched a his eye went right to my mouth have you ever been kissed lily i shook my head no and tilted my face up to his because i needed him to change that right then and there or i wasn t gon na be able to breathe then almost a if i were made of eggshell he lowered his mouth to mine and just rested it there i didn t know what to do next but i didn t care i didn t care if we just stayed like that all night and never even moved our mouth it wa everything his lip closed over mine and i could kind of feel his hand shaking i did what he wa doing and started to move my lip like he wa i felt the tip of his tongue brush across my lip once and i thought my eye were about to roll back in my head he did it again and then a third time so i finally did it too when our tongue touched for the first time i kind of smiled a little because i d thought about my first kiss a lot where it would be who it would be with never in a million year did i imagine it would feel like this he pushed me on my back and pressed his hand against my cheek and kept kissing me it just got better and better a i grew more comfortable my favorite moment wa when he pulled back for a second and looked down at me then came back even harder i don t know how long we kissed a long time so long my mouth started to hurt and my eye couldn t stay open when we fell asleep i m pretty sure his mouth wa still touching mine we didn t talk about boston again i still don t know if he s leaving lily dear ellen i need to apologize to you it s been a week since i ve written to you and a week since i ve watched your show don t worry i still record it so you ll get the rating but every day we get off the bus atlas take a quick shower and then we make out every day it s awesome i don t know what it is about him but i feel so comfortable with him he s so sweet and thoughtful he never doe anything i don t feel comfortable with but so far he hasn t tried anything i don t feel comfortable with i m not sure how much i should divulge here since you and i have never met in person but let me just say that if he s ever wondered what my boob feel like now he know i can t for the life of me figure out how people function from day to day when they like someone this much if it were up to me we would kiss all day and all night and do nothing in between except maybe talk a little he tell funny story i love it when he s in a talkative mood because it doesn t happen very often but he us his hand a lot he smile a lot too and i love his smile even more than i love his kiss and sometimes i just tell him to shut up and stop smiling or kissing or talking so i can stare at him i like looking at his eye they re so blue that he could be standing across a room and a person could tell how blue his eye were the only thing i don t like about kissing him sometimes is when he close his eye and no we still haven t talked about boston lily dear ellen yesterday afternoon when we were riding the bus atlas kissed me it wasn t anything new to u because we had kissed a lot by this point but it s the first time he ever did it in public when we re together everything else just seems to fade away so i don t think he even thought about other people noticing but katie noticed she wa sitting in the seat behind u and i heard her say gross a soon a he leaned over and kissed me she wa talking to the girl next to her when she said i can t believe lily let him touch her he wear the same clothes almost every day ellen i wa so mad i also felt awful for atlas he pulled away from me and i could tell what she said bothered him i started to turn around to yell at her for judging someone she doesn t even know but he grabbed my hand and shook his head no don t lily he said so i didn t but for the rest of the bus ride i wa so angry i wa angry that katie would say something so ignorant just to hurt someone she thought wa beneath her i wa also hurt that atlas appeared to be used to comment like that i didn t want him to think i wa embarrassed that anyone saw him kiss me i know atlas better than any of them do and i know what a good person he is no matter what his clothes look like or that he used to smell before he started using my shower i leaned over and kissed him on the cheek and then rested my head on his shoulder you know what i said to him he slid his finger through mine and squeezed my hand what you re my favorite person i felt him laugh a little and it made me smile out of how many people he asked all of them he kissed the top of my head and said you re my favorite person too lily by a long shot when the bus came to a stop on my street he didn t let go of my hand when we started to walk off he wa in front of me in the aisle and i wa walking behind him so he didn t see it when i turned around and flipped off katie i probably shouldn t have done it but the look on her face made it worth it when we got to my house he took the house key out of my hand and unlocked my front door it wa weird seeing how comfortable he is at my house now he walked in and locked the door behind u that s when we noticed the electricity in the house wasn t working i looked out the window and saw a utility truck down the street working on the power line so that meant we couldn t watch your show i wasn t too upset because it meant we would probably just make out for an hour and a half doe your oven run off gas or electricity he asked gas i said a little confused that he wa asking about our oven he kicked off his shoe which were really just a pair of my father s old shoe and he started walking toward the kitchen i m going to make you something he said you know how to cook he opened the refrigerator and started moving thing around yep i probably love to cook a much a you love to grow thing he took a few thing out of the refrigerator and preheated the oven i leaned against the counter and watched him he wasn t even looking at a recipe he wa just pouring thing into bowl and mixing them without even using a measuring cup i had never seen my father lift a finger in the kitchen i m pretty sure he wouldn t even know how to preheat our oven i kind of thought most men were like that but watching atlas work his way around my kitchen proved me wrong what are you making i asked him i pushed my hand on the island and hoisted myself onto it cooky he said he walked the bowl over to me and stuck a spoon in the mixture he brought the spoon up to my mouth and i tasted it one of my weakness is cookie dough and this wa the best i d ever tasted oh wow i said licking my lip he set the bowl down beside me and then leaned in and kissed me cookie dough and atlas s mouth mixed together is like heaven in case you re wondering i made a noise deep in my throat that let him know how much i liked the combination and it made him laugh but he didn t stop kissing me he just laughed through the kiss and it completely melted my heart a happy atlas wa near mind blowing it made me want to uncover every single thing about this world that he like and give it all to him when he wa kissing me i wondered if i loved him i ve never had a boyfriend before and have nothing to compare my feeling to in fact i ve never really wanted a boyfriend or a relationship until atlas i m not growing up in a household with a great example of how a man should treat someone he love so i ve always held on to an unhealthy amount of distrust when it come to relationship and other people there have been time i ve wondered if i could ever allow myself to trust a guy for the most part i hate men because the only example i have is my father but spending all this time with atlas is changing me not in a huge way i don t think i still distrust most people but atlas is changing me enough to believe that maybe he s an exception to the norm he stopped kissing me and picked up the bowl again he walked it over to the opposite counter and started spooning dough onto two cookie sheet you want to know a trick to cooking with a gas oven he asked i m not sure i really ever cared about cooking before but he somehow made me want to know everything he knew it might have been how happy he looked when he talked about it gas oven have hot spot he said a he opened the oven door and put the cookie sheet inside you have to be sure and rotate the pan so they ll cook evenly he closed the door and pulled the oven mitt off his hand he tossed it on the counter a pizza stone help too if you just keep it in the oven even when you aren t baking pizza it help eliminate the hot spot he walked over to me and placed his hand on either side of me the electricity kicked on right a he wa pulling down the collar of my shirt he kissed the spot on my shoulder he always love kissing and slowly slid his hand up my back i swear sometimes when he s not even here i can still feel his lip on my collarbone he wa about to kiss me on the mouth when we heard a car pull into the driveway and the garage door start to open i jumped off the island looking around the kitchen frantically his hand went up to my cheek and he made me look at him keep an eye on the cooky they ll be finished in about twenty minute he pressed his lip to mine and then released me rushing to the living room to grab his backpack he made it out the back door right when i heard the engine to my father s car shut off i started gathering all the ingredient together when my father walked into the kitchen from the garage he looked around and then saw the light on in the oven are you cooking he asked i nodded because my heart wa beating so fast i wa scared he d hear the trembling in my voice if i responded out loud i scrubbed for a moment at a spot on the counter that wa perfectly clean i cleared my throat and said cooky i m baking cooky he set his briefcase down on the kitchen table and then walked to the refrigerator and pulled out a beer the electricity ha been out i said i wa bored so i decided to bake while i waited for it to come back on my father sat down at the table and spent the next ten minute asking me question about school and if i d thought about going to college occasionally when it wa just the two of u i saw glimpse of a how a normal relationship with a father could be sitting at the kitchen table with him discussing college and career choice and high school a much a i hated him most of the time i still longed for more of these moment with him if he could just always be the guy he wa capable of being in these moment thing would be so much different for all of u i rotated the cooky like atlas had said to do and when they were finished i pulled them out of the oven i took one off the cookie sheet and handed it to my father i hated that i wa being nice to him it almost felt like i wa wasting one of atlas s cooky wow my father said these are great lily i forced a thank you even though i didn t make them i couldn t very well tell him that though they re for school so you can only have one i lied i waited until the rest of them cooled and then i put them in a tupperware container and took them to my room i didn t even want to try one without atlas so i waited until later last night when he came over you should have tried one when they were hot he said that s when they re the best i didn t want to eat them without you i said we sat on the bed with our back against the wall and proceeded to eat half the bowl of cooky i told him they were delicious but failed to tell him they were by far the greatest cooky i d ever eaten i didn t want to inflate his ego i kind of liked how humble he wa i tried to grab at another one but he pulled the bowl away and put the lid back on it if you eat too many you ll make yourself sick and you won t like my cooky anymore i laughed impossible he took a drink of water and then stood up facing the bed i made you something he said reaching into his pocket more cooky i asked he smiled and shook his head then held out a fist i lifted my hand and he dropped something hard in the palm of my hand it wa a small flat outline of a heart about two inch long carved out of wood i rubbed my thumb over it trying not to smile too big it wasn t an anatomically correct heart but it also didn t look like the hand drawn heart it wa uneven and hollow in the middle you made this i asked looking up at him he nodded i carved it with an old whittling knife i found at the house the end of the heart weren t connected they just curved in a little leaving a little space at the top of the heart i didn t even know what to say i felt him sit back down on the bed but i couldn t stop looking at it long enough to even thank him i carved it out of a branch he said whispering from the oak tree in your backyard i swear ellen i never thought i could love something so much or maybe what i wa feeling wasn t for the gift but for him i closed my fist around the heart and then leaned over and kissed him so hard he fell back onto the bed i threw my leg over him and straddled him and he grabbed my waist and grinned against my mouth i m gon na carve you a damn house out of that oak tree if this is the reward i get he whispered i laughed you have to stop being so perfect i told him you re already my favorite person but now you re making it really unfair to all the other human because no one will ever be able to catch up to you he brought his hand to the back of my head and rolled me until i wa on my back and he wa the one on top then my plan is working he said right before kissing me again i held on to the heart while we kissed wanting to believe it wa a gift for no reason at all but part of me wa scared it wa a gift to remember him by when he leaf for boston i didn t want to remember him if i had to remember him it would mean he wasn t a part of my life anymore i don t want him to move to boston ellen i know that s selfish of me because he can t keep living in that house i don t know what i m more afraid might happen watching him leave or selfishly begging him not to go i know we need to talk about it i ll ask him about boston tonight when he come over i just didn t want to ask him last night because it wa a really perfect day lily dear ellen just keep swimming just keep swimming he s moving to boston i don t really feel like talking about it lily dear ellen this is going to be a big one for my mother to hide my father is usually pretty cognizant of hitting her where it won t leave a visible bruise the last thing he probably want is for people in the town to know what he doe to her i ve seen him kick her a few time choke her hit her on the back and the stomach pull her hair the few time he s hit her on the face it s always just been a slap so the mark wouldn t stay for long but never have i seen him do what he did last night it wa really late when they got home it wa a weekend so he and my mom went to some community function my father ha a real estate company and he s also the town mayor so they have to do thing in the public a lot like go to charity dinner which is ironic since my father hate charity but i guess he ha to save face atlas wa already in my room when they got home i could hear them f ighting a soon a they walked through the front door a lot of the conversation wa muffled but for the most part it sounded like my father wa accusing her of flirting with some man now i know my mother ellen she would never do something like that if anything a guy probably looked at her and it made my father jealous my mother is really beautiful i heard him call her a whore and then i heard the first blow i started to climb out of my bed but atlas pulled me back and told me not to go in there that i might get hurt i told him it actually help sometimes that when i go in there my father back off atlas tried to talk me out of it but finally i got up and went out into the living room ellen i just he wa on top of her they were on the couch and he had his hand around her throat but his other hand wa pulling up her dress she wa trying to fight him off and i just stood there frozen she kept begging him to get off her and then he hit her right across the face and told her to shut up i ll never forget his word when he said you want attention i ll give you some fucking attention and that s when she got real still and stopped fighting him i heard her cry and then she said please be quiet lily is here she said please be quiet please be quiet while you rape me dear ellen i didn t know one human wa capable of feeling so much hate inside one heart and i m not even talking about my father i m talking about me i walked straight to the kitchen and i opened a drawer i grabbed the biggest knife i could find and i don t know how to explain it it wa like i wasn t even in my own body i could see myself walking across the kitchen with the knife in my hand and i knew i wasn t going to use it i just wanted something bigger than myself that could scare him away from her but right before i made it out of the kitchen two arm went around my waist and picked me up from behind i dropped the knife and my father didn t hear it but my mother did we locked eye a atlas carried me back to my bedroom when we were back inside my room i just started hitting him in the chest trying to get back out there to her i wa cry and doing everything i could to get him out of my way but he wouldn t move he just wrapped his arm around me and said lily calm down he kept saying it over and over and he held me there for a long time until i accepted that he wasn t gon na let me go back out there he wasn t gon na let me have that knife he walked over to the bed and grabbed his jacket and started putting on his shoe we ll go next door he said we ll call the police the police my mother had warned me not to call the police in the past she said it could jeopardize my father s career but in all honesty i didn t care at that point i didn t care that he wa the mayor or that everyone who loved him didn t know the awful side of him the only thing i cared about wa helping my mother so i pulled on my jacket and went to the closet for a pair of shoe when i stepped out of my closet atlas wa staring at my bedroom door it wa opening my mother stepped inside and quickly shut it locking it behind her i ll never forget what she looked like she had blood coming down from her lip her eye wa already starting to swell and she had a clump of hair just resting on her shoulder she looked at atlas and then me i didn t even take a moment to feel scared that she caught me in my room with a boy i didn t care about that i wa just worried about her i walked over to her and grabbed her hand and walked her to my bed i brushed the hair off her shoulder and then from her forehead he s gon na go call the police mom okay her eye grew real wide and she started shaking her head no she said she looked over at atlas and said you can t no he wa already at the window about to leave so he stopped and looked at me he s drunk lily she said he heard your door shut so he went to our bedroom he stopped if you call the police it ll just make it worse believe me just let him sleep it off it ll be better tomorrow i shook my head and could feel the tear stinging my eye mom he wa trying to rape you she ducked her head and winced when i said that she shook her head again and said it s not like that lily we re married and sometimes marriage is just you re too young to understand it it got really quiet for a minute and then i said i hope to hell i never do that s when she started to cry she just held her head in her hand and she started to sob and all i could do wa wrap my arm around her and cry with her i d never seen her this upset or this hurt or this scared it broke my heart ellen it broke me when she wa finished cry i looked around the room and atlas had left we went to the kitchen and i helped her clean up her lip and her eye she never did say anything about him being there not one thing i waited for her to tell me i wa grounded but she never did i realized that maybe she didn t acknowledge it because that s what she doe thing that hurt her just get swept under the rug never to be brought up again lily dear ellen i think i m ready to talk about boston now he left today i ve shuffled my deck of card so many time my hand hurt i m scared if i don t get out how i feel on paper i ll go crazy holding it all in our last night didn t go over so well we kissed a lot at first but we were both too sad to really care about it for the second time in two day he told me he changed his mind and that he wasn t leaving he didn t want to leave me alone in this house but i ve lived with these parent for almost sixteen year it wa silly of him to turn down a home in favor of being homeless just because of me we both knew that but it still hurt i tried to not be so sad about it so when we were lying there i asked him to tell me about boston i told him maybe one day when i got out of school i could go there he got this look in his eye when he started talking about it a look i d never seen sort of like he wa talking about heaven he told me about how everyone ha the greatest accent there instead of car they say cah he must not realize that he sometimes say his r s like that too he said he lived there from the age of nine until he wa fourteen so i guess maybe he picked up a little bit of the accent he told me about how his uncle life in an apartment building with the coolest rooftop deck a lot of apartment have them he said some even have pool plethora maine probably didn t even have a building that wa tall enough for a rooftop deck i wondered what it would feel like to be that high up i asked him if he ever went up there and he said yes that when he wa younger sometimes he would go to the roof and just sit up there and think while he looked out over the city he told me about the food i already knew he liked to cook but i had no idea how much passion he had for it i guess because he doesn t have a stove or a kitchen so other than the cooky he baked me he s never really talked about cooking before he told me about the harbor and how before his mother remarried she used to take him fishing out there i mean boston isn t any different from any other big city i guess he said there s not a lot that make it stand out it s just i don t know there s a vibe a really good energy when people say they live in boston they re proud of it i miss that sometimes i ran my finger through his hair and said well you make it sound like the best place in the world like everything is better in boston he looked at me and his eye were sad when he said everything is almost better in boston except the girl boston doesn t have you that made me blush he kissed me real sweet and then i said to him boston doesn t have me yet someday i ll move there and i ll find you he made me promise said if i moved to boston everything really would be better there and it would be the best city in the world we kissed some more and did other thing that i won t bore you with although that s not to say they were boring they were not but then this morning i had to tell him goodbye and he held me and kissed me so much i thought i might die if he let go but i didn t die because he let go and here i am still living still breathing just barely lily i flip to the next page but then slam the book shut there s only one more entry and i don t know that i really feel like reading it right now or ever i put the journal back in my closet knowing that my chapter with atlas is over he s happy now i m happy now time can definitely heal all wound or at least most of them i turn off my lamp and then pick up my phone to plug it in i have two missed text message from ryle and one from my mother ryle hey naked truth commencing in ryle i wa worried that being in a relationship would add to my responsibility that s why i ve avoided them my whole life i already have enough on my plate and seeing the stress my parent marriage seemed to cause them and the failed marriage of some of my friend i wanted no part in something like that but after tonight i realized that maybe a lot of people are just doing it wrong because what s happening between u doesn t feel like a responsibility it feel like a reward and i ll fall asleep wondering what i did to deserve it i pull my phone to my chest and smile then i screenshot the text because i m keeping it forever i open up the third text message mom a doctor lily and your own business i want to be you when i grow up i screen shot that one too et and talk at the same time when she s being positive my dad kept giving me love pat love pat are soft punch of encouragement that are administered on the knee shoulder and arm my sister said that she could help me fix up my hair it wa weird to have them pay so much attention to me what do you mean what s wrong with my hair my sister just kind of looked around uncomfortable i reached my hand up to my hair and realized that a lot of it wa gone i honestly don t remember when i did it but from the look of my hair i must have grabbed a pair of scissors and just started cutting without strategy big chunk of it were missing all over the place it wa like a butcher s cut i hadn t looked at myself in the mirror at the party for a long time because my face wa different and frightened me or else i would have noticed my sister did help me trim it up a bit and i wa lucky because everyone in school including sam and patrick thought it looked cool chic wa patrick s word regardless i decided to never take lsd again january dear friend love always charlie i feel like a big faker because i ve been putting my life back together and nobody know it s hard to sit in my bedroom and read like i always did it s even hard to talk to my brother on the phone his team finished third in the nation nobody told him we missed the game live because of me i went to the library and checked out a book because i wa getting scared every now and then thing would start moving again and sound were bass heavy and hollow and i couldn t put a thought together the book said that sometimes people take lsd and they don t really get out of it they said that it increase this one type of brain transmitter they said that essentially the drug is twelve hour of schizophrenia and if you already have a lot of this brain transmitter you don t get out of it i started breathing fast in the library it wa really bad because i remembered some of the schizophrenic kid in the hospital when i wa little and it didn t help that this wa the day after i noticed that all the kid were wearing their new christmas clothes so i decided to wear my new suit from patrick to school and wa teased mercilessly for nine straight hour it wa such a bad day i skipped my first class ever and went to see sam and patrick outside looking sharp charlie patrick said grinning can i have a cigarette i said i couldn t bring myself to say bum a smoke not for my first one i just couldn t sure said patrick sam stopped him what s wrong charlie i told them what wa wrong which prompted patrick to keep asking me if i had a bad trip no no it s not that i wa really getting upset sam put her arm around my shoulder and she said she knew what i wa going through she told me i shouldn t worry about it once you do it you remember how thing looked on it that s all like how the road turned into wave and how your face wa plastic and your eye were two different size it s all in your mind that s when she gave me the cigarette when i lit it i didn t cough it actually felt soothing i know that s bad in a health class way but it wa true now focus on the smoke sam said and i focused on the smoke now that look normal doesn t it uh huh i think i said now look at the cement on the playground is it moving uh huh okay now focus on the piece of paper that s just sitting there on the ground and i focused on the piece of paper that wa sitting on the ground is the cement moving now no it s not from there you go to you re going to be okay to you probably should never do acid again sam went on to explain what she called the trance the trance happens when you don t focus on anything and the whole big picture swallow and move around you she said it wa usually metaphoric but for people who should never do acid again it wa literal that s when i started laughing i wa so relieved and sam and patrick smiled i wa glad they started smiling too because i couldn t stand their looking so worried thing have stopped moving for the most part ever since i haven t skipped another class and i guess now i don t feel like a big faker for trying to put my life back together bill thought my paper on the catcher in the rye which i wrote on my new old typewriter wa my best one yet he said i wa developing at a rapid pace and gave me a different kind of book a a reward it s on the road by jack kerouac i m now up to about ten cigarette a day january dear friend love always charlie doe that work sometimes i wanted to ask sam about the other side of sometimes but i didn t want to be too personal and i didn t want to know deep down i wish i could stop being in love with sam i really do love always charlie february dear friend i don t feel very well because everything is messy i did go to the dance and i did tell mary elizabeth how nice her outfit wa i did ask her question and i let her talk the whole time i learned a lot about objectification native american and the bourgeoisie but most of all i learned about mary elizabeth mary elizabeth want to go to berkeley and get two degree one is for political science the other is for sociology with a minor concentration in woman s study mary elizabeth hate high school and want to explore lesbian relationship i asked her if she thought girl were pretty and she looked at me like i wa stupid and said that s not the point mary elizabeth s favorite movie is red her favorite book is an autobiography of a woman who wa a character in red i can t remember her name mary elizabeth s favorite color is green her favorite season is spring her favorite ice cream flavor she said she refuse to eat low fat frozen yogurt on principle alone is cherry garcia her favorite food is pizza half mushroom half green pepper mary elizabeth is a vegetarian and she hate her parent she is also fluent in spanish the only thing she asked me the whole time wa whether or not i wanted to kiss her good night when i said that i wasn t ready she said she understood and told me what a great time she had she said i wa the most sensitive boy she d ever met which i didn t understand because really all i did wa not interrupt her then she asked me if i wanted to go out again sometime which sam and i hadn t discussed so i wasn t prepared to answer it i said yes because i didn t want to do anything wrong but i don t think i can think of a whole other night s worth of question i don t know what to do how many date can you go on and still not be ready to kiss i don t think i will ever be ready for mary elizabeth i ll have to ask sam about this incidentally sam took patrick to the dance after craig said he wa too busy i guess they had a big fight about it finally craig said that he didn t want to go to some stupid high school dance since he had already graduated at one point in the dance patrick went to the parking lot to get stoned with his guidance counselor and mary elizabeth wa requesting that the deejay play some girl band which left sam and me alone are you having a good time sam didn t answer right away she just kind of looked sad not really are you i don t know this is my first date so i don t know what to compare it to don t worry you ll do fine really you want some punch sure with that sam left she really did look sad and i wished i could have made her feel better but sometimes i guess you just can t so i stood alone by the wall and watched the dance for a while i would describe it to you but i think it s the kind of thing where you have to be there or at least know the people but then again maybe you knew the same people when you went to your high school dance if you know what i mean the one different thing about this particular dance wa my sister she wa with her boyfriend and during a slow song it looked like they had a huge fight because he stopped looking at her and she rushed off the dance floor to where the bathroom are i tried to follow her but she had too much of a head start she never came back to the dance and her boyfriend eventually left after mary elizabeth dropped me off i went into the house and found my sister cry in the basement this wa a different kind of cry it kind of frightened me i talked very quiet and slow are you okay leave me alone charlie no really what s wrong you wouldn t understand i could try that s a laugh that s really a laugh do you want me to wake up mom and dad then no well maybe they could charlie shut up okay just shut up that s when she really started cry i didn t want to make her feel worse so i turned to leave her alone that s when my sister started hugging me she didn t say anything she just hugged me tight and wouldn t let go so i hugged her back it wa weird too because i ve never hugged my sister not when she wasn t forced to anyway after a while she calmed down a bit and let go she took a deep breath and brushed off the hair that wa sticking to her face that s when she told me she wa pregnant i would tell you about the rest of the night but i honestly don t remember much about it it s all a very sad daze i do know that her boyfriend said it wasn t his baby but my sister knew that it wa and i do know that he broke up with her right there at the dance my sister hasn t told anybody else about it because she doesn t want it to get around the only people who know are me her and him i m not allowed to tell anyone we know not anyone not ever i told my sister that after a while she probably couldn t hide it but she said she wouldn t let it go that far since she wa eighteen she didn t need mom or dad s permission all she needed wa someone to be with her next saturday at the clinic and that person wa me it s lucky i got my license now i said that to make her laugh but she didn t february dear friend love always charlie i wa sitting in the waiting room of the clinic i had been there for an hour or so i don t remember exactly how long bill had given me a new book to read but i just couldn t concentrate on it i guess it make sense why not then i tried to read some magazine but again i just couldn t it wasn t so much that they mentioned what the people were eating it wa all the magazine cover each one had a smiling face and every time it wa a woman on the cover she wa showing her cleavage i wondered if those woman wanted to do that to look pretty or if it wa just part of the job i wondered if they had a choice or not if they wanted to be successful i just couldn t get that thought out of my mind i could almost see the photo shoot and the actress or model going to eat a light lunch with her boyfriend afterward i could see him asking her about her day and how she wouldn t think too much of it or maybe if it wa her first magazine cover how she would be very excited because she wa starting to become famous i could see the magazine on the newsstand and a lot of anonymous eye looking at it and how some people would think it wa very important and then how a girl like mary elizabeth would be very angry about the actress or model showing her cleavage along with all the other actress and model doing the same thing while some photographer like craig would just look at the quality of the photograph then i thought there would be some men who would buy the magazine and masturbate to it and i wondered what the actress or her boyfriend thought about that if they did at all and then i thought that it wa about time for me to stop thinking because it wasn t doing my sister any good that s when i started thinking about my sister i thought about the time when she and her friend painted my fingernail and how that wa okay because my brother wasn t there and the time she let me use her doll to make up play or let me watch whatever i wanted to watch on tv and when she started becoming a young lady and no one wa allowed to look at her because she thought she wa fat and how she really wasn t fat and how she wa actually very pretty and how different her face looked when she realized boy thought she wa pretty and how different her face looked the first time she really liked a boy who wa not on a poster on her wall and how her face looked when she realized she wa in love with that boy and then i wondered how her face would look when she came out from behind those door my sister wa the one who told me where baby come from my sister wa also the one who laughed when i immediately asked her where baby go to when i thought that i started to cry but i couldn t let anyone see me because if they did they might not let me drive her home and they might call our parent and i couldn t let that happen because my sister wa counting on me and this wa the first time anyone ever counted on me for anything when i realized that this wa the first time i cried since i made my aunt helen the promise not to cry unless it wa for something important i had to go outside because i couldn t hide it from anyone anymore i must have been in the car for a long time because eventually my sister found me there i wa chain smoking cigarette and cry still my sister knocked on the window i rolled it down she looked at me with this curious expression then her curiosity turned to anger charlie are you smoking she wa so mad i can t tell you how mad she wa i can t believe you re smoking that s when i stopped cry and started laughing because of all the thing she could have said right after she got out of there she picked my smoking and she got angry about it and i knew if my sister wa angry then her face wouldn t be that different and she would be okay i m going to tell mom and dad you know no you re not god i couldn t stop laughing when my sister thought about it for a second i think she figured out why she wouldn t tell mom or dad it s like she suddenly remembered where we were and what had just happened and how crazy our whole conversation wa considering all that then she started laughing but the laughing made her feel sick so i had to get out of the car and help her into the backseat i had already set up the pillow and blanket for her because we figured it wa probably best for her to sleep it off a little in the car before we went home just before she fell asleep she said well if you re going to smoke crack the window at least which made me start laughing again charlie smoking i can t believe it which made me laugh harder and i said i love you and my sister said i love you too just stop it with the laughing already eventually my laughing turned into the occasional chuckle and then it just stopped i looked back and saw that my sister wa asleep so i started the car and turned on the heater so she would be warm that s when i started reading the book bill gave me it s walden by henry david thoreau which is my brother s girlfriend s favorite book so i wa very excited to read it when the sun went down i put my smoking pamphlet on the page where i stopped reading and started driving home i stopped a few block from our house to wake up my sister and put the blanket and pillow in the trunk we pulled into the driveway we got out we went inside and we heard our mother and father s voice from the top of the stair where have you two been all day yeah dinner s almost ready my sister looked at me i looked at her she shrugged so i started talking a mile a minute about how we saw a movie and how my sister taught me how to drive on the highway and how we went to mcdonald s mcdonald s when your mother cooked rib you know my father wa reading the paper a i talked my sister went up to my father and gave him a kiss on the cheek he didn t look up from his paper i know but we didn t go to mcdonald s until before the movie and that wa a while ago then my father said matter of factly what movie did you see i froze but my sister came through with the name of a movie just before she kissed my mother on the cheek i had never heard of this movie wa it any good i froze again my sister wa so calm it wa okay those rib smell great yeah i said then i thought of something to change the subject hey dad is the hockey game on tonight yeah but you re only allowed to watch it with me if you don t ask any of your stupid question okay but can i ask one now before it start i don t know can you may i i asked corrected he grunted go ahead what do the player call a hockey puck again a biscuit they call it a biscuit great thanks from that moment and all through dinner my parent didn t ask any more question about our day although my mom did say how glad she wa that my sister and i were spending more time together that night after our parent went to sleep i went down to the car and got the pillow and blanket out of the trunk i brought them to my sister in her room she wa pretty tired and she spoke very softly she thanked me for the whole day she said that i didn t let her down and she said that she wanted it to be our little secret since she decided to tell her old boyfriend that the pregnancy wa a false alarm i guess she just didn t trust him with the truth anymore just after i turned out the light and opened the door i heard her say softly i want you to stop smoking you hear i hear because i really do love you charlie i love you too i mean it so do i okay then good night good night that s when i shut the door and left her to sleep i didn t feel like reading that night so i went downstairs and watched a half hour long commercial that advertised an exercise machine they kept flashing a number so i called it the woman who picked up the other end of the phone wa named michelle and i told michelle that i wa a kid and did not need an exercise machine but i hoped she wa having a good night that s when michelle hung up on me and i didn t mind a bit march dear friend love always charlie girl are weird and i don t mean that offensively i just can t put it any other way i have now gone on another date with mary elizabeth in a lot of way it wa similar to the dance except that we got to wear more comfortable clothes she wa the one who asked me out again and i suppose that s okay but i think i m going to start doing the asking from time to time because i can t always hope to get asked also if i do the asking then i ll be sure to go out with the girl of my choice if she say yes it s just so complicated the good news is that i got to be the one who drove this time i asked my father if i could borrow his car it happened at the dinner table what for my dad get protective of his car charlie s got a girlfriend my sister said she s not my girlfriend i said who is this girl my father asked what s going on my mother asked from the kitchen charlie want to borrow the car my dad replied what for my mother asked that s what i m trying to find out my father said with a raised voice no need to get snippy my mother said sorry my father said without meaning it then he turned back to me so tell me about this girl so i told him a little about mary elizabeth leaving out the part about the tattoo and belly button ring he kind of smiled for a little while trying to see if i wa already guilty of something then he said yes i could borrow his car when my mother came in with coffee my father told her the whole story while i ate dessert that night a i wa finishing my book my father came in and sat on the edge of my bed he lit a cigarette and started telling me about sex he gave me this talk a few year before but it wa more biological then now he wa saying thing like i know i m your old man but you can t be too careful these day and wear protection and if she say no then you have to assume she mean it because if you force her to do something she doesn t want to do then you re in big trouble mister and even if she say no and really mean yes then quite frankly she s playing game and isn t worth the price of dinner if you need to talk to somebody you can come to me but if you don t want to do that for some reason talk to your brother and finally i m glad we had this talk then my father ruffled my hair smiled and left the room i guess i should tell you that my father isn t like on television thing like sex don t embarrass him and he is actually very smart about them i think he wa especially happy because i used to kiss this boy in the neighborhood a lot when i wa very little and even though the psychiatrist said it wa very natural for little boy and girl to explore thing like that i think my father wa afraid anyway i guess that s natural but i m not sure why anyway mary elizabeth and i went to see a movie downtown it wa what they call an art movie mary elizabeth said it won an award at some big film festival in europe and she thought that wa impressive a we waited for the movie to start she said what a shame it wa that so many people would go to see a stupid hollywood movie but there were only a few people in this theater then she talked about how she couldn t wait to get out of here and go to college where people appreciate thing like that then the movie started it wa in a foreign language and had subtitle which wa fun because i had never read a movie before the movie itself wa very interesting but i didn t think it wa very good because i didn t really feel different when it wa over but mary elizabeth felt different she kept saying it wa an articulate film so articulate and i guess it wa the thing is i didn t know what it said even if it said it very well later i drove u to this underground record store and mary elizabeth gave me a tour she love this record store she said it wa the one place where she felt like herself she said that before coffee shop were popular there wa nowhere for kid like her to go except the big boy and that wa old until this year she showed me the movie section and told me about all these cult filmmaker and people from france then she took me down to the import section and told me about real alternative music then she took me to the folk section and told me about girl band like the slit she said she felt really bad she hadn t gotten me anything for christmas and she wanted to make it up to me then she bought me a record by billie holiday and asked if i wanted to go to her house and listen to it so i wa sitting alone in her basement while she wa upstairs getting u something to drink and i looked around the room which wa very clean and smelled like people didn t live there it had a fireplace with a mantel and golf trophy and there wa a television and a nice stereo and then mary elizabeth came downstairs with two glass and a bottle of brandy she said that she hated everything her parent loved except for brandy she asked me to pour the drink while she made a fire she wa very excited too which wa strange because she s never like that she kept talking about how much she love fire and how she wanted to marry a man and live in vermont someday which wa strange too because mary elizabeth never talk about thing like that when she finished the fire she put on the record and kind of danced over to me she said she felt very warm but not in the temperature sense the music started and she clinked my glass said cheer and took a sip of brandy brandy is very good by the way but it wa better at the secret santa party we finished the first glass very quickly my heart wa beating really fast and i wa starting to get nervous she handed me another glass of brandy and touched my hand very softly when she did it then she slipped her leg over mine and i watched it just dangle there then i felt her hand on the back of my neck just kind of moving slowly and my heart started beating crazy do you like the record she asked real quiet very much i really did too it wa beautiful charlie uh huh do you like me uh huh you know what i mean uh huh are you nervous uh huh don t be nervous okay that s when i felt her other hand it started at my knee and worked it way up the side of my leg to my hip and stomach then she took her leg off mine and kind of sat on my lap facing me she looked right into my eye and she never blinked not once her face looked warm and different and she leaned down and started kissing my neck and ear then my cheek then my lip and everything kind of melted away she took my hand and slid it up her sweater and i couldn t believe what wa happening to me or what breast felt like or later what they looked like or how difficult bra are after we had done everything you can do from the stomach up i lay down on the floor and mary elizabeth put her head on my chest we both breathed very slowly and listened to the music and the fire crack when the last song wa over i felt her breath on my chest charlie uh huh do you think i m pretty i think you re very pretty really really then she held on to me a little tighter and for the next half hour mary elizabeth didn t talk at all all i could do wa lie there and think about how much her voice changed when she asked me if she wa pretty and how much she changed when i answered and how sam said she didn t like thing like that and how much my arm wa beginning to hurt thank god we heard the automatic garage door opener when we did love always charlie march dear friend it s finally starting to get a little warm here and the people are being nicer in the hallway not to me necessarily just in a general way i wrote a paper about walden for bill but this time i did it differently i didn t write a book report i wrote a report pretending that i wa by myself near a lake for two year i pretended that i lived off the land and had insight to tell you the truth i kind of like the idea of doing that right now ever since that night with mary elizabeth everything ha been different it started out that monday in school where sam and patrick looked at me with big grin mary elizabeth had told them about the night we spent together which i really didn t want her to do but sam and patrick thought it wa great and they were really happy for both of u sam kept saying i can t believe i didn t think of it before you guy are great together i think mary elizabeth think so too because she s been acting completely different she s nice all the time but it doesn t feel right i don t know how to describe it it s like we ll be having a cigarette outside with sam and patrick at the end of the day and we ll all be talking about something until it s time to go home then when i get home mary elizabeth will call me right away and ask me what s up and i don t know what to say because the only thing new in my life is my walk home which isn t a lot but i describe the walk anyway and then she start talking and she doesn t stop for a long time she s been doing this all week that and picking lint off my clothes at one point two day ago she wa talking about book and she included a lot of book i had read and when i told her that i had read them she asked me very long question that were really just her idea with a question mark put at the end the only thing i could say wa either yes or no there wa honestly no room to say anything else after that she started talking about her plan for college which i had heard before so i put down the phone went to the bathroom and when i came back she wa still talking i know that wa the wrong thing to do but i thought if i didn t take a break i would do something even worse like yell or hang up the phone she also keep talking about the billie holiday record she bought for me and she say she want to expose me to all these great thing and to tell you the truth i don t really want to be exposed to all these great thing if it mean that i ll have to hear mary elizabeth talk about all the great thing she exposed me to all the time it almost feel like of the three thing involved mary elizabeth me and the great thing only the first one matter to mary elizabeth i don t understand that i would give someone a record so they could love the record not so they would always know that i gave it to them then there wa the dinner since the holiday were over my mom asked if i would like to have sam and patrick over for dinner like she promised after i told her they said she had great taste in clothing i wa so excited i told patrick and sam and we made plan for a sunday night and about two hour later mary elizabeth walked up to me in the hall and said what time sunday i didn t know what to do it wa just for sam and patrick that wa the whole idea from the beginning and i never even invited mary elizabeth i guess i know why she assumed that she would be invited but she never even waited to see or even drop a hint or anything so at the dinner the dinner where i wanted my mom and dad to see how nice and great sam and patrick were mary elizabeth talked the whole time it wasn t all her fault my dad and mom asked her more question than they asked sam or patrick i guess because i am going on date with mary elizabeth and that is more curious to them than my friend are i guess that make sense but still it s like they never got to meet sam and patrick and that wa the whole point by the time dinner wa over and they all left all my mom said wa that mary elizabeth wa smart and all my dad said wa my girlfriend wa pretty they didn t say anything about sam or patrick and all i wanted from the whole night wa for them to know my friend that wa very important to me sex thing are weird too it s like after that first night we have this pattern where we basically do what we did that first time but there is no fire or billie holiday record because we are in a car and everything is rushed maybe this is the way thing are supposed to be but it doesn t feel right my sister ha been reading all these book about woman ever since she told her ex boyfriend that the pregnancy wa a false alarm and he wanted to get back together and she said no so i asked her about mary elizabeth leaving out the sex part because i knew she could be neutral about it especially since she stayed clear of the dinner my sister said mary elizabeth is suffering from low self esteem but i told her that she said the same thing about sam back in november when she started dating craig and sam is completely different everything can t be low self esteem can it my sister tried to clarify thing she said that by introducing me to all these great thing mary elizabeth gained a superior position that she wouldn t need if she wa confident about herself she also said that people who try to control situation all the time are afraid that if they don t nothing will work out the way they want i don t know if this is right or not but it made me sad regardless not for mary elizabeth or for me just in general because i started to think that i didn t know who mary elizabeth wa at all i m not saying she wa lying to me but she just acted so different before i got to know her and if she really isn t like what she wa at the beginning i wish she could have just said so but maybe she is like she wa at the beginning and i just didn t realize it i just don t want to be another thing mary elizabeth is in charge of i asked my sister what i should do and she said the best thing to do is be honest about my feeling my psychiatrist said the same thing and then i felt really sad because i thought maybe i wa different from how mary elizabeth originally saw me too and maybe i wa lying by not telling her that it wa hard to listen to her all the time without getting to say anything back but i wa just trying to be nice like sam said i should i don t know where i went wrong i tried to call my brother about this but his roommate said he wa really busy with school so i decided not to leave a message because i didn t want to distract him the one thing i did wa mail my report about walden to him so he could share it with his girlfriend then maybe if they had time they could read it and we could talk about it and i would have the chance to ask them both what to do about mary elizabeth since they were going out in a good way and would know how to make thing work even if we didn t get to talk about it i would still love to meet my brother s girlfriend even on the phone i did get to see her once on a vcr tape of one of my brother s football game but it s really not the same thing even though she wa very beautiful but not in an unconventional way i don t know why i m saying all this i just wish mary elizabeth would ask me question other than what s up april dear friend love always charlie i have made a terrible mess of thing i really have i feel terrible about it patrick said the best thing i could do is just stay away for a while it all started last monday mary elizabeth came to school with a book of poem by a famous poet named e e cummings the story behind the book wa that she saw a movie that talked about one poem that compare this woman s hand to flower and rain she thought it wa so beautiful that she went out and bought the book she ha read it a lot of time since and she said she wanted me to have my own copy not the copy she bought but a new one all day she told me to show everyone the book i know i should have been grateful because it wa a very nice thing to do but i wasn t grateful i wasn t grateful at all don t get me wrong i acted like i wa but i wasn t to tell you the truth i wa starting to get mad maybe if she would have given me the copy of the book that she bought for herself it would have been different or maybe if she had just hand copied the rain poem she love on a piece of nice paper and definitely if she didn t make me show the book to everyone we know maybe i should have been honest then but it didn t feel like the right time when i left school that day i didn t go home because i just couldn t talk to her on the phone and my mother is not a very adroit liar about thing like that so instead i walked to the area where all the shop and video store are i went straight to the bookstore and when the lady behind the counter asked me if i needed any help i opened up my bag and i returned the book mary elizabeth bought me i didn t do anything with the money it just sat in my pocket when i walked home all i could think wa what a terrible thing it wa that i just did and i started cry by the time i walked in the front door i wa cry so much that my sister stopped watching television to talk to me when i told her what i did she drove me back to the bookstore because i wa too messy to drive and i got the book back which made me feel a little better when mary elizabeth asked me where i had been all day on the phone that night i told her that i went to the store with my sister and when she asked if i bought her something nice i said i did i didn t even think she wa serious but i said it anyway i just felt so bad about almost returning her book i spent the next hour on the phone listening to her talk about the book then we said good night then i went downstairs to ask my sister if she could drive me to the store again so i could get mary elizabeth something nice my sister told me to drive myself and that i had better start being honest with mary elizabeth about how i feel maybe i should have then but it just didn t feel like the right time the next day in school i gave mary elizabeth the gift that i drove to buy her it wa a new copy of to kill a mockingbird the first thing mary elizabeth said wa that s original i just reminded myself that she didn t say it mean she wasn t making fun of me she wasn t comparing or criticizing and she really wasn t believe me so i just explained to her how bill give me special book to read outside of class and how to kill a mockingbird wa the first one and how it wa special to me then she said thank you it s very sweet but then she went on to explain how she had read it three year earlier and thought it wa overrated and how they turned it into a black and white film with famous actor like gregory peck and robert duvall that won an academy award for the screenplay writer i just kind of put my feeling away somewhere after that i left school walked around and didn t get home until one o clock in the morning when i explained to my father why he told me to act like a man the next day in school when mary elizabeth asked where i had been the day before i told her that i bought a pack of cigarette went to the big boy and spent the entire day reading the e e cummings book and eating club sandwich i knew i wa safe saying that because she would never ask me any question about the book and i wa right after she got done talking about it that time i didn t think i d ever really need to read it myself even if i wanted to i definitely think i should have been honest then but to tell you the truth i wa getting a mad a i used to get playing sport and it wa starting to scare me luckily easter vacation wa starting on friday and it distracted thing a little bit bill gave me hamlet to read for the break he said i would need the free time to really concentrate on the play i guess i don t need to say who wrote it the only advice bill gave me wa to think about the main character in term of the other main character in the book i ve read thus far he said not to get caught up thinking the play wa too fancy so on good friday yesterday we had a special showing of the rocky horror picture show what made it special wa the fact that everyone knew it wa the beginning of easter vacation and a lot of kid were still wearing their suit and dress from mass it reminded me of ash wednesday in school when the kid come in with thumbprint on their forehead it always add an air of excitement after the show craig invited all of u back to his apartment to drink wine and listen to the white album after the record wa over patrick suggested we all play truth or dare a game that he love to play when he s buzzed guess who chose dare over truth all night me i just didn t want to tell mary elizabeth the truth because of a game it wa working pretty well most of the night the dare were thing like chug a beer but then patrick gave me a dare i don t even think he knew what he wa doing but he gave it to me anyway kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lip that s when i chose to be honest in retrospect i probably could not have picked a worse time the silence started after i stood up since mary elizabeth wa sitting right next to me by the time i had knelt down in front of sam and kissed her the silence wa unbearable it wasn t a romantic kiss it wa friendly like when i played rocky and she played janet but it didn t matter i could say that it wa the wine or the beer that i chugged i could also say that i had forgotten the time mary elizabeth asked me if i thought she wa pretty but i would be lying the truth is that when patrick dared me i knew that if i kissed mary elizabeth i would be lying to everyone including sam including patrick including mary elizabeth and i just couldn t do it anymore even if it wa part of a game after the silence patrick did his best to salvage the evening the first thing he said wa well isn t this awkward but it didn t work mary elizabeth walked quickly out of the room and into the bathroom patrick told me later that she didn t want anyone to see her cry sam followed her but before she completely left the room she turned to me and said serious and dark what the fuck is wrong with you it wa the look on her face when she said it and how much she meant it it suddenly made everything seem like it really wa i felt terrible just terrible patrick immediately stood up and took me out of craig s apartment we walked to the street and the only thing i wa aware of wa the cold i said that i should go back inside and apologize patrick said no i ll get our coat just stay here when patrick left me outside i started to cry it wa real and panicky and i couldn t stop it when patrick came back i said really cry i really think i should go apologize patrick shook his head believe me you don t want to go in there then he jiggled the car key in front of my face and said come on i ll take you home in the car i told patrick everything that had been going on about the record and the book and to kill a mockingbird and how mary elizabeth never asked any question and all patrick said wa it s too bad you re not gay that made me stop cry a little bit then again if you were gay i would never date you you re a mess that made me start laughing a little bit and i thought brad wa fucked up jesus that made me laugh a lot more then he turned on the radio and we drove through the tunnel back home when he dropped me off patrick told me the best thing to do wa keep away for a while i guess i already told you that he said that when he knew more he d give me a call thanks patrick don t mention it and then i said you know patrick if i were gay i d want to date you i don t know why i said it but it seemed right patrick just smiled cocky and said of course then he peeled out down the road when i lay down in bed that night i put on the billie holiday record and i started reading the book of e e cummings poem after i read the poem that compare the woman s hand to flower and rain i put the book down and went to the window i stared at my reflection and the tree behind it for a long time not thinking anything not feeling anything not hearing the record for hour something really is wrong with me and i don t know what it is april dear friend love always charlie nobody ha called me since that night i don t blame them i have spent the whole vacation reading hamlet bill wa right it wa much easier to think of the kid in the play like the other character i ve read about so far it ha also helped me while i m trying to figure out what s wrong with me it didn t give me any answer necessarily but it wa helpful to know that someone else ha been through it especially someone who lived such a long time ago i did call mary elizabeth and i told her that i d been listening to the record every night and reading the e e cummings book she just said it s too late charlie i would have explained that i didn t want to start going on date again and i wa just doing these thing a a friend but i knew it would have only made thing worse so i didn t i just said i m sorry and i really wa sorry and i know that she believed me but when that didn t make any difference and there wa nothing but a bad silence on the phone i really knew it wa too late patrick did call me but all he said wa that craig got really angry at sam about me and i should keep staying away until thing got clear i asked him if he would like to go out just him and me he said that he would be busy with brad and family thing but he d try to call me if he could find the time so far he hasn t i would tell you about easter sunday with my family but i ve already told you about thanksgiving and christmas and there really isn t much of a difference except that my father got a raise and my mother didn t because she doesn t get paid for housework and my sister stopped reading those self esteem book because she met a new boy my brother did come home but when i asked him if his girlfriend read my report on walden he said no because she broke up with him when she found out he wa cheating on her that happened a while ago so i asked him if he had read it himself and he said that he hadn t because he wa too busy he said he would try to read it over vacation so far he hasn t so i went to visit my aunt helen and for the first time in my life it didn t help i even tried to follow my own plan and remember all the detail about the last time i had a great week but that didn t help either i know that i brought this all on myself i know that i deserve this i d do anything not to be this way i d do anything to make it up to everyone and to not have to see a psychiatrist who explains to me about being passive aggressive and to not have to take the medicine he give me which is too expensive for my dad and to not have to talk about bad memory with him or be nostalgic about bad thing i just wish that god or my parent or sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what s wrong with me just tell me how to be different in a way that make sense to make this all go away and disappear i know that s wrong because it s my responsibility and i know that thing get worse before they get better because that s what my psychiatrist say but this is a worse that feel too big after a week of not talking to anyone i finally called bob i know that s wrong but i didn t know what else to do i asked him if he had anything i could buy he said he had a quarter ounce of pot left so i took some of my easter money and bought it i ve been smoking it all the time since love always charlie part april dear friend i wish i could report that it s getting better but unfortunately it isn t it s hard too because we ve started school again and i can t go to the place where i used to go and it can t be like it wa and i wasn t ready to say good bye just yet to tell you the truth i ve just been avoiding everything i walk around the school hallway and look at the people i look at the teacher and wonder why they re here if they like their job or u and i wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen not in a mean way in a curious way it s like looking at all the student and wondering who s had their heart broken that day and how they are able to cope with having three quiz and a book report on top of that or wondering who did the heart breaking and wondering why especially since i know that if they went to another school the person who had their heart broken would have had their heart broken by somebody else so why doe it have to be so personal and if i went to another school i would never have known sam or patrick or mary elizabeth or anyone except my family i can tell you one thing that happened i wa in the shopping mall because that s where i go lately for the last couple of week i ve been going there every day trying to figure out why people go there it s kind of a personal project there wa this one little boy he might have been four year old i m not sure he wa cry really hard and he kept screaming for his mom he must have been lost then i saw this older kid who wa maybe seventeen i think he went to a different school because i had never seen him before anyway this older kid who wa really tough looking with a leather jacket and long hair and everything went up to the little boy and asked him what his name wa the little boy answered and stopped cry then the older kid walked away with the little boy a minute later i heard the intercom say to the mom that her boy wa at the information desk so i went to the information desk to see what would happen i guess the mom had been searching for the little boy for a long time because she came running up to the information desk and when she saw the little boy she started cry she held him tightly and told him to never run off again then she thanked the older kid who had helped and all the older kid said wa next time just watch him a little fucking better then he walked away the man with the moustache behind the information desk wa speechless so wa the mom the little boy just wiped his nose looked up at his mom and said french fry the mom looked down at the little boy and nodded and they left so i followed them they went to the place where the food stand are and they got french fry the little boy wa smiling and getting ketchup all over himself and the mom kept wiping his face in between taking drag off her cigarette i kept looking at the mom trying to imagine what she must have looked like when she wa young if she wa married if her little boy wa an accident or planned and if that made a difference i saw other people there old men sitting alone young girl with blue eye shadow and awkward jaw little kid who looked tired father in nice coat who looked even more tired kid working behind the counter of the food place who looked like they hadn t had the will to live for hour the machine kept opening and closing the people kept giving money and getting their change and it all felt very unsettling to me so i decided to find another place to go and figure out why people go there unfortunately there aren t a lot of place like that i don t know how much longer i can keep going without a friend i used to be able to do it very easily but that wa before i knew what having a friend wa like it s much easier not to know thing sometimes and to have french fry with your mom be enough the only person i ve really talked to in the last two week wa susan the girl who used to go with michael back in middle school when she had brace i saw her standing in the hall surrounded by a group of boy i didn t know they were all laughing and making sex joke and susan wa doing her best to laugh along with them when she saw me approaching the group her face went ashen it wa almost like she didn t want to remember what she wa like twelve month ago and she certainly didn t want the boy to know that she knew me and used to be my friend the whole group got quiet and stared at me but i didn t even notice them i just looked at susan and all i said wa do you ever miss him i didn t say it mean or accusingly i just wanted to know if anybody else remembered michael to tell you the truth i wa stoned in a bad way and i couldn t get the question out of my mind susan wa at a loss she didn t know what to do these were the first word we had spoken since the end of last year i guess it wasn t fair of me to ask her in a group like that but i never see her by herself anymore and i really needed to know at first i thought her blank expression wa the result of surprise but after it didn t go away for a long while i knew that it wasn t it suddenly dawned on me that if michael were still around susan probably wouldn t be going out with him anymore not because she s a bad person or shallow or mean but because thing change and friend leave and life doesn t stop for anybody i m sorry i bothered you susan i m just having a tough time that s all have a good one i said and walked away god that kid is such a fucking freak i heard one of the boy whisper when i wa halfway down the hall he said it more factual than mean and susan didn t correct him i don t know if i would have corrected him myself these day love always charlie may dear friend a few day ago i went to see bob to buy more pot i should probably say that i keep forgetting bob doesn t go to school with u probably because he watch more television than anyone i know and he s great with trivia you should see him talk about mary tyler moore it s kind of spooky bob ha this very specific way of living he say he take a shower every other day he weighs his stash daily he say when you re smoking a cigarette with someone and you have a lighter you should light their cigarette first but if you have match you should light your cigarette first so you breathe in the harmful sulfur instead of them he say it s the polite thing to do he also say that it s bad luck to have three on a match he heard that from his uncle who fought in vietnam something about how three cigarette wa enough time for the enemy to know where you are bob say that when you re alone and you light a cigarette and the cigarette is only halfway lit that mean someone is thinking about you he also say that when you find a penny it s only lucky if it s head up he say the best thing to do is find a lucky penny when you re with someone and give the other person the good luck he belief in karma he also love to play card bob go part time to the local community college he want to be a chef he is an only child and his parent are never home he say it used to bother him a lot when he wa younger but not so much anymore the thing about bob is that when you first meet him he s really interesting because he know about cigarette rule and penny and mary tyler moore but after you ve known him for a while he start to repeat these thing in the last few week he hasn t said anything that i haven t heard from him before that s what made it such a shock when he told me what happened basically brad s father caught brad and patrick together i guess that brad s father didn t know about his son because when he caught them brad s father started beating brad not a slap kind of beating a belt kind a real kind patrick told sam who told bob that he had never seen anything like it i guess it wa that bad he wanted to say stop and you re killing him he even wanted to hold brad s father down but he just froze and brad kept yelling get out to patrick and finally patrick just did that wa last week and brad still hasn t come to school everyone think he might have been sent to a military school or something nobody know for sure about anything patrick tried calling once but when brad s father answered he just hung up bob said patrick wa in bad shape i can t tell you how sad i felt when he told me that because i wanted to call patrick and be his friend and help him but i didn t know if i should call him because of what he had said about waiting until thing got clear the thing wa i couldn t think about anything else so on friday i went to the rocky horror picture show i waited until the movie had already started before i went into the theater i didn t want to ruin the show for everybody i just wanted to see patrick play frank n furter just like he always doe because i knew that if i saw that i knew he would be okay just like my sister getting mad at me for smoking cigarette i sat in the back row and looked on the stage it wa still a couple of scene before frank n furter enters that s when i saw sam playing janet and i missed her so much and i wa so sorry about how i messed everything up especially when i saw mary elizabeth playing magenta it wa all very hard to watch but then patrick finally came on a frank n furter and he wa great he wa actually better than ever in a lot of way it wa just so nice to see all my friend i left before the movie wa over i drove home listening to some of the song we listened to those time when we were infinite and i pretended they were in the car with me i even talked out loud i told patrick how i thought he wa great i asked sam about craig i told mary elizabeth that i wa sorry and how much i really loved the e e cummings book and wanted to ask her question about it but then i stopped because it started to make me too sad i also thought that if anybody saw me talking out loud when i wa alone in the car their look might convince me that the something that s wrong with me might be even worse than i thought when i got home my sister wa watching a movie with her new boyfriend there isn t much to say other than his name is erik and he ha short hair and is a junior erik had rented the movie after i shook hand with him i asked them about the movie because i didn t recognize it except for an actor who used to be on a tv show and i couldn t remember his name my sister said it s stupid you wouldn t like it i said what s it about she said come on charlie it s almost over i said would it be okay if i watched the end she said you can watch it when we re done i said well how about i watch the end with you and then i can rewind it and watch up to the point i started watching with you that s when she paused the movie can t you take a hint i suppose not we want to be alone charlie oh i m sorry to tell you the truth i knew she wanted to be alone with erik but i really wanted to have some company i knew it wasn t fair though to ruin her time just because i miss everybody so i just said good night and left i went up to my room and started reading the new book bill gave me it s called the stranger bill said that it s very easy to read but very hard to read well i have no idea what he mean but i like the book so far love always charlie may dear friend it s strange how thing can change back a suddenly a they changed originally when one thing happens and suddenly thing are back to normal on monday brad came back to school he looked very different it wasn t that he wa bruised or anything his face actually looked fine but before brad wa always this guy who walked down the hallway with a bounce i can t really describe it any other way it s just that some people walk with their head to the ground for some reason they don t like to look other people in the eye brad wa never like that but now he is especially when it come to patrick i saw them talking quiet in the hallway i wa too far away to hear what they said but i could tell that brad wa ignoring patrick and when patrick started to get upset brad just closed his locker and walked away it wasn t that strange because brad and patrick never talked in school since brad wanted thing to be secret the strange part wa that patrick would walk up to brad in the first place so i guessed that they didn t meet on the golf course anymore or talk on the phone even later that afternoon i wa having a cigarette outside by myself and i saw patrick alone also having a cigarette i wasn t close enough to really see him but i didn t want to interfere with his personal time so i didn t walk up to him but patrick wa cry he wa cry pretty hard after that whenever i saw him around anywhere he didn t look like he wa there he looked like he wa someplace else and i think i knew that because that s how people used to say i wa maybe they still do i m not sure on thursday something really terrible happened i wa sitting alone in the cafeteria eating salisbury steak when i saw patrick walk up to brad who wa sitting with his football buddy and i saw brad ignore him like he did at the locker and i saw patrick get really upset but brad still ignored him then i saw patrick say something and he looked pretty angry a he turned to walk away brad sat still for a second then he turned around and then i heard it it wa just loud enough for a few table to hear the thing that brad yelled at patrick faggot brad s football buddy start laughing a few table got quiet a patrick turned around he wa mad a hell i m not kidding he stormed up to brad s table and said what did you call me god he wa mad i d never seen patrick like that before brad sat quiet for a second but his buddy kept egging him on by pushing his shoulder brad looked up at patrick and said softer and meaner than the last time i called you a faggot brad s buddy started laughing even harder that is until patrick threw the first punch it s kind of eerie when a whole room get quiet at once and then the real noise start the fight wa hard a lot harder than the one i had with sean last year there wa no clean punching or thing you see in movie they just wrestled and hit and whoever wa the most aggressive or the most angry got in the most hit in this case it wa pretty even until brad s buddy got involved and it became five on one that s when i got involved i just couldn t watch them hurt patrick even if thing weren t clear just yet i think anyone who knew me might have been frightened or confused except maybe my brother he taught me what to do in these situation i don t really want to go into detail except to say that by the end of it brad and two of his buddy stopped fighting and just stared at me his other two friend were lying on the ground one wa clutching the knee i bashed in with one of those metal cafeteria chair the other one wa holding his face i kind of swiped at his eye but not too bad i didn t want to be too bad i looked down at the ground and i saw patrick his face wa pretty messed up and he wa cry hard i helped him to his foot and then i looked at brad i don t think we d ever really exchanged two word before but i guess this wa the time to start all i said wa if you ever do this again i ll tell everyone and if that doesn t work i ll blind you i pointed at his friend who wa holding his face and i knew brad heard me and knew that i meant it he didn t say anything back though because the security guard of our school came to bring all of u out of the cafeteria they took u first to the nurse and then to mr small patrick started the fight so he wa suspended for a week brad s buddy got three day each for ganging up on patrick after they broke up the original fight brad wasn t suspended at all because it wa self defense i didn t get suspended either because i wa just helping to defend a friend when it wa five on one brad and i got a month s detention starting that day in detention mr harris didn t set up any rule he just let u read or do homework or talk it really isn t much of a punishment unless you like the television program right after school or are very concerned with your permanent record i wonder if it s all a lie a permanent record i mean on that first day of detention brad came to sit next to me he looked very sad i think it all kind of hit him after he stopped feeling numb from the fight charlie yeah thanks thanks for stopping them you re welcome and that wa it i haven t said anything to him since and he didn t sit next to me today at first when he said it i wa kind of confused but then i think i got it because i wouldn t want a bunch of my friend beating up sam even if i wasn t allowed to like her anymore either when i got out of detention that day sam wa waiting for me the minute i saw her she smiled i wa numb i just couldn t believe she wa really there then i saw her turn and give brad a real cold look brad said tell him i m sorry sam replied tell him yourself brad looked away and walked to his car then sam walked up to me and messed up my hair so i heard you re this ninja or something i think i nodded sam drove me home in her pickup truck on the way she told me that she wa really angry at me for doing what i did to mary elizabeth she told me that mary elizabeth is a really old friend of hers she even reminded me that mary elizabeth wa there for her when she went through that tough time she told me about when she gave me the typewriter i don t really want to repeat what that wa so she said that when i kissed her instead of mary elizabeth i really hurt their friendship for a while because i guess mary elizabeth really liked me a lot that made me feel sad because i didn t know that she liked me that much i just thought she wanted to expose me to all those great thing that s when sam said charlie you re so stupid sometimes do you know that yeah i really do know that honest then she said that mary elizabeth and she got over it and she thanked me for taking patrick s advice and staying away for a long a i did because it made thing easier so then i said so we can be friend now of course wa all she said and patrick and patrick and everyone else and everyone else that s when i started cry but sam told me to shush you remember what i said to brad yeah you told him that he should tell patrick that he wa sorry himself that go for mary elizabeth too i tried but she told me i know you tried i m telling you to try again okay sam dropped me off when she wa too far away to see me i started to cry again because she wa my friend again and that wa enough for me so i made myself promise to never mess up like i did before and i m never going to i can tell you that when i went to the rocky horror picture show tonight it wa very tense not because of mary elizabeth that wa actually okay i said i wa sorry and then i asked her if there wa anything she wanted to say to me and like before i asked a question and got a very long answer when i wa done listening i really did listen i said i wa sorry again then she thanked me for not trying to make what i did seem less by offering a lot of excuse and thing were back to normal except we were just friend to tell you the truth i think the biggest reason for everything being okay is that mary elizabeth started dating one of craig s friend his name is peter and he s in college which make mary elizabeth happy at the party at craig s apartment i overheard mary elizabeth say to alice that she wa much happier with peter because he wa opinionated and they had debate she said that i wa really sweet and understanding but that our relationship wa too one sided she wanted a person who wa more open to discussion and didn t need someone s permission to talk i wanted to laugh or maybe get mad or maybe shrug at how strange everyone wa especially me but i wa at a party with my friend so it really didn t matter that much i just drank because i figured that it wa about time to stop smoking so much pot the thing that made the evening tense wa patrick officially quit doing frank n furter in the show he said that he didn t want to do it anymore ever so he sat and watched the show in the audience with me and he said thing that were hard to listen to because patrick usually isn t unhappy you ever think charlie that our group is the same a any other group like the football team and the only real difference between u is what we wear and why we wear it yeah and there wa this pause well i think it s all bullshit and he meant it it wa hard to see him mean it that much some guy that i didn t know from somewhere else did the part of frank n furter he had been the second to patrick for a long time and now he got his chance he wa pretty good too not a good a patrick but pretty good love always charlie may dear friend i ve been spending a lot of time with patrick these day i really haven t said much i just kind of listen and nod because patrick need to talk but it isn t like it wa with mary elizabeth it s different it started out on the saturday morning after the show i wa in my bed trying to figure out why sometimes you can wake up and go back to sleep and other time you can t then my mom knocked your friend patrick s on the phone so i got up and wiped away the sleep hello get dressed i m on my way click that wa it i actually had a lot of work to do since it wa getting closer to the end of the school year but it sounded like we might be having some kind of adventure so i got dressed anyway patrick pulled up about ten minute later he wa wearing the same clothes he wore the night before he hadn t showered or anything i don t even think he went to bed he wa just wide awake on coffee and cigarette and mini thins which are these small pill you can buy at quick mart or truck stop they keep you awake they re not illegal either but they make you thirsty so i climbed in patrick s car which wa filled with cigarette smoke he offered me one but i said not in front of my house your parent don t know you smoke no should they i guess not then we started driving fast at first patrick didn t say much he just listened to the music on the tape player after the second song started i asked him if it wa the mix tape i made him for secret santa christmas i ve been listening to it all night patrick had this smile all over his face it wa a sick smile glazey and numb he just turned up the volume and drove faster i ll tell you something charlie i feel good you know what i mean really good like i m free or something like i don t have to pretend anymore i m going away to college right it ll be different there you know what i mean sure i said i ve been thinking all night about what kind of poster i want to put up in my dorm room and if i ll have an exposed brick wall i ve always wanted an exposed brick wall so i can paint it know what i mean i just nodded this time because he didn t really wait for a sure thing ll be different there they have to be they will be i said you really think so sure thanks charlie that s kind of how it went all day we went to see a movie and we ate pizza and every time patrick started getting tired we got coffee and he ate another mini thin or two when thing started turning dusk outside he showed me all the place he and brad would meet he didn t say much about them he just stared we ended up at the golf course we sat on the eighteenth green which wa pretty high on a hill and we watched the sun disappear by this point patrick had bought a bottle of red wine with his fake id and we passed it back and forth just talking did you hear about lily he asked who lily miller i don t know what her real first name wa but they called her lily she wa a senior when i wa a sophomore i don t think so i thought your brother would have told you it s a classic maybe okay stop me if you heard it okay so lily come up here with this guy who wa the lead in all the play parker right parker how did you know my sister had a crush on him perfect we were getting pretty drunk so parker and lily come up here one night and they are so in love he even gave her his thespian pin or something at this point patrick is spitting out wine between sentence he s laughing so hard they even had a song something like broken wing by that band mr mister i don t even know but i hope it wa broken wing because it would make the story perfect keep going i encouraged okay okay he swallowed so they ve been going out for a long time and i think they ve even had sex before but this wa going to be a special night she packed a little picnic and he brought a boom box to play broken wing patrick just couldn t get over that song he laughed for ten minute okay okay i m sorry so they have this picnic with sandwich and everything they start to make out the stereo s playing and they re just about to do it when parker realizes he forgot the condom they re both naked on this putting green they both want each other there s no condom so what do you think happened i don t know they did it doggie style with one of the sandwich bag no wa all i could really say yes wa patrick s rebuttal god wa my counter yes wa patrick s conclusion after we shook off the giggle and wasted most of the wine with spit take he turned to me and you want to know the best part what she wa the valedictorian and everyone knew it when she went up to give her speech there s nothing like the deep breath after laughing that hard nothing in the world like a sore stomach for the right reason it wa that great so patrick and i shared all the story we could think of there wa a kid named barry who used to build kite in art class then after school he would attach firecracker to the kite and fly it and blow it up he s now studying to be an air traffic controller patrick s story via sam and then there wa this kid named chip who spent all of his money from allowance and christmas and birthday to buy bug killing equipment and he would go door to door asking if he could kill the bug for free my story via my sister there wa a guy named carl burn and everyone called him c b and one day c b got so drunk at a party that he tried to fuck the host s dog patrick s story and there wa this guy they called action jack because supposedly he wa caught masturbating at a drunk party and at every pep rally the kid would clap and chant action jack clap clap clap action jack my story via my brother there were other story and other name second base stace who had breast in the fourth grade and let some of the boy feel them vincent who took acid and tried to flush a sofa down the toilet sheila who allegedly masturbated with a hot dog and had to go to the emergency room the list went on and on by the end all i could think wa what these people must feel like when they go to their class reunion i wonder if they re embarrassed and i wonder if that s a small price to pay for being a legend after we sobered up a bit with coffee and mini thins patrick drove me home the mix tape i made for him hit a bunch of winter song and patrick turned to me thanks charlie sure no i mean in the cafeteria sure after that it wa quiet he drove me home and pulled up in the driveway we hugged good night and when i wa just about to let go he held me a little tighter and he moved his face to mine and he kissed me a real kiss then he pulled away real slow i m sorry no that s okay really i m sorry no really it wa okay so he said thanks and hugged me again and moved in to kiss me again and i just let him i don t know why we stayed in his car for a long time we didn t do anything other than kiss and we didn t even do that for very long after a while his eye lost the glazey numb look from the wine or the coffee or the fact that he had stayed up the night before then he started cry then he started talking about brad and i just let him because that s what friend are for may dear friend love always charlie it seems like every morning since that first night i wake up dull and my head hurt and i can t breathe patrick and i have been spending a lot of time together we drink a lot actually it s more like patrick drink and i sip it s just hard to see a friend hurt this much especially when you can t do anything except be there i want to make him stop hurting but i can t so i just follow him around whenever he want to show me his world one night patrick took me to this park where men go to find each other patrick told me that if i didn t want to be bothered by anyone that i should just not make eye contact he said that eye contact is how you agree to fool around anonymously nobody talk they just find place to go after a while patrick saw someone he liked he asked me if i needed any cigarette and when i said no he patted my shoulder and walked away with this boy i just sat on a bench looking around all i saw were the shadow of people some on the ground some by a tree some just walking it wa so quiet after a few minute i lit a cigarette and i heard somebody whisper you got an extra cigarette the voice asked i turned around and saw a man in shadow sure i said i reached out to hand the man a cigarette he took it you got a light he said sure i said and i struck a match for him instead of just leaning down and lighting the cigarette he reached out to make a cup around the match with our hand which is something we all do when it s windy but it wasn t windy i think he just wanted to touch my hand because while he wa lighting the cigarette he did it for a lot longer than necessary maybe he wanted me to see his face over the glow of the match to see how handsome he wa i don t know he did look familiar but i couldn t figure out from where he blew out the match thanks and exhaled no problem i said mind if i sit down he asked not really he sat down and said a few thing and it wa his voice i recognized his voice so i lit another cigarette and looked at his face again and thought hard and that s when i figured it out it wa the guy who doe the sport on the tv news nice night he said i couldn t believe it i guess i managed to nod because he kept talking about sport he kept talking about how the designated hitter in baseball wa bad and why basketball wa a commercial success and what team looked promising in college football he even mentioned my brother s name i swear all i said wa so what s it like being on television it must have been the wrong thing to say because he just got up and walked away it wa too bad because i wanted to ask him if he thought my brother would make it to the pro another night patrick took me to this place where they sell popper which is this drug you inhale they didn t have popper but the guy behind the counter said that he had something that wa just a good so patrick bought that it wa in this aerosal can we both took a sniff of it and i swear we both thought we were going to die of a heart attack all in all i think patrick took me to about every place there is to go that i wouldn t have known about otherwise there wa this karaoke bar on one of the main street in the city and there wa this dance club and this one bathroom in this one gym all these place sometimes patrick would pick up guy sometimes he wouldn t he said that it wa hard being safe and you never know the night he would pick up someone always made him sad it s hard too because patrick began every night really excited he always said he felt free and tonight wa his destiny and thing like that but by the end of that night he just looked sad sometimes he would talk about brad sometimes he wouldn t but after a while the whole thing just wasn t interesting to him anymore and he ran out of thing to keep himself numb so tonight he dropped me off at home it wa the night we went back to the park where men meet and the night he saw brad there with some guy brad wa too into what he wa doing to notice u patrick didn t say anything he didn t do anything he just walked back to the car and we drove in silence on the way he threw the bottle of wine out the window and it landed with a crash and this time he didn t try to kiss me like he had every night he just thanked me for being his friend and drove away love always charlie may dear friend the school year is just about over we have another month or so to go but the senior like my sister and sam and patrick only have a couple of week then they have prom and graduation and they are all busy making plan mary elizabeth is taking her new boyfriend peter my sister is taking erik patrick is going with alice and craig agreed to go with sam this time they have even rented a limo and everything not my sister though she s going in her new boyfriend s car which is a buick bill ha been very sentimental lately because he can feel his first year of teaching coming to an end at least that s what he said to me he wa planning on moving to new york and writing play but he told me that he doesn t really think he want to anymore he really like teaching kid english and think maybe he can take over the drama department too next year i guess he s been thinking about this a lot because he hadn t given me a new book to read since the stranger he did ask me to watch a lot of movie though and write an essay about what i thought of all those movie the movie were the graduate harold maude my life a a dog which ha subtitle dead poet society and a movie called the unbelievable truth which wa very hard to find i watched all the movie in one day it wa quite great the essay i wrote wa very similar to the past few essay i wrote because everything bill tell me to read or see are similar except the time he had me read naked lunch incidentally he told me he had given me that book because he had just broken up with his girlfriend and wa feeling philosophical i guess that s why he wa sad that afternoon when we talked about on the road he apologized for letting his personal life affect his teaching and i accepted because i didn t know what else to do it s strange to think about your teacher a being people even when they re bill i guess he ha since made up with his girlfriend they re living together now at least that s what he said so in school bill gave me my final book to read for the year it s called the fountainhead and it s very long when he gave me the book bill said be skeptical about this one it s a great book but try to be a filter not a sponge sometimes i think bill forgets that i am sixteen but i am very happy that he doe i haven t started reading it because i am very behind in my other class because i spent so much time with patrick but if i can catch up i will end my first year with straight a s which make me very happy i almost didn t get an a in math but then mr carlo told me to stop asking why all the time and just follow the formula so i did now i get perfect score on all my test i just wish i knew what the formula did i honestly have no idea i wa just thinking that i wrote to you first because i wa afraid about starting high school today i feel good so that s kind of funny by the way patrick stopped drinking that night he saw brad in the park i guess he s feeling better he just want to graduate and go to college now i saw brad in detention the monday after i saw him at the park and he looked just like he always look love always charlie may dear friend i ve been reading the fountainhead for the past few day and it s an excellent book i read on the back cover that the author wa born in russia and came to america when she wa young she barely spoke english but she wanted to be a great writer i thought that wa very admirable so i sat down and tried to write a story ian macarthur is a wonderful sweet fellow who wear glass and peer out of them with delight that wa the first sentence the problem wa that i just couldn t think of the next one after cleaning my room three time i decided to leave ian alone for a while because i wa starting to get mad at him i ve had a lot of time to write and read and think about thing this past week because everyone is busy with prom and graduation and schedule next friday is their last day of school and then prom is on tuesday which i thought wa strange because i thought it would be on a weekend but sam told me that every school can t have their prom on the same night or else there wouldn t be enough tuxedo and restaurant to go around i said it felt very well planned and then sunday is their graduation it all feel very exciting i wish it were happening to me i wonder what it will be like when i leave this place the fact that i will have to have a roommate and buy shampoo i thought how great it would be to go to my senior prom three year from now with sam i hope it s on a friday and i hope i will be a valedictorian at graduation i wonder what my speech would be and if bill would help me with it if he didn t go to new york and write play or maybe he would even if he wa in new york writing play i think that would be especially nice of him i don t know the fountainhead is a very good book i hope i am being a filter june dear friend love always charlie did you have a senior prank i m guessing you probably did because my sister said it s a tradition at a lot of school this year the prank wa a follows some senior filled the swimming pool with about six thousand package of grape kool aid i have no idea who think of these thing or why except that the senior prank is supposed to signify the end of school what this ha to do with a grape pool is beyond me but i wa very happy not to have gym it s actually been a very exciting time because we ve all been busy finishing up the year this friday is the last day of school for all of my friend and my sister they ve been talking about their prom nonstop even the people that think it s a joke like mary elizabeth can t stop talking about what a joke it is it s all very fun to witness so by this time everyone ha finally figured out which school he or she is going to next year patrick is going to the university of washington because he want to be near the music there he say he think he want to work for a record company someday maybe be a publicist or a person who find new band sam finally made her decision to leave early for the summer program at the college of her choice i love that expression college of my choice safety school is another favorite the thing wa that sam got into two school the college of her choice and a safety school she could have started at the safety school in the fall but in order to go to the college of her choice she had to do this special summer program just like my brother that s right the school is penn state which is so great because now i can visit my brother and sam with one trip i don t want to think about sam leaving just yet but i did wonder what would happen if she and my brother ever started dating which is stupid because they are nothing alike and sam is in love with craig i have to stop doing this my sister is going to a small liberal art college back east called sarah lawrence she almost didn t get to go because it cost a lot of money but then she got an academic scholarship through the rotary club or moose lodge or something like that which i thought wa very generous of them my sister is going to be second in her class i thought she might have been valedictorian but she got a b when she wa going through that tough time with her old boyfriend mary elizabeth is going to berkeley and alice is going to study movie at new york university i never even knew she liked movie but i guess she doe she call them film incidentally i finished the fountainhead it wa a really great experience it s strange to describe reading a book a a really great experience but that s kind of how it felt it wa a different book from the others because it wasn t about being a kid and it wasn t like the stranger or naked lunch even though i think it wa philosophical in a way but it wasn t like you had to really search for the philosophy it wa pretty straightforward i thought and the great part is that i took what the author wrote about and put it in term of my own life maybe that s what being a filter mean i m not sure there wa this one part where the main character who is this architect is sitting on a boat with his best friend who is a newspaper tycoon and the newspaper tycoon say that the architect is a very cold man the architect reply that if the boat were sinking and there wa only room in the lifeboat for one person he would gladly give up his life for the newspaper tycoon and then he say something like this i would die for you but i won t live for you something like that i think the idea is that every person ha to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people maybe that is what make people participate i m not really certain because i don t know if i would mind living for sam for a while then again she wouldn t want me to so maybe it s a lot friendlier than all that i hope so anyway i told my psychiatrist about the book and bill and about sam and patrick and all their college but he just keep asking me question about when i wa younger the thing is i feel that i m just repeating the same memory to him i don t know he say it s important i guess we ll have to see i would write a little more today but i have to learn my math formula for the final on thursday wish me luck love always charlie june dear friend i wanted to tell you about u running there wa this beautiful sunset and there wa this hill the hill up to the eighteenth green where patrick and i spit wine from laughing and just a few hour before sam and patrick and everyone i love and know had their last day of high school ever and i wa happy because they were happy my sister even let me hug her in the hallway congratulation wa the word of the day so sam and patrick and i went to the big boy and smoked cigarette then we went walking waiting for it to be time to go to rocky horror and we were talking about thing that seemed important at the time and we were looking up that hill and then patrick started running after the sunset and sam immediately followed him and i saw them in silhouette running after the sun then i started running and everything wa a good a it could be that night patrick decided to play frank n furter one last time he wa so happy to put on the costume and everyone wa happy he decided to do it it wa quite moving actually he gave the best show i ever saw him give maybe i wa biased but i don t care it wa the show i ll always remember especially his last song the song is called i m going home in the movie tim curry who play the character cry during that song but patrick wa smiling and it felt just right i even persuaded my sister to come to the show with her boyfriend i have been trying to get her to come since i started going but she never would but this time she did and since she and her boyfriend never saw the show before they were technically virgin which meant they would have to do all these embarrassing thing before the show started to get initiated i decided not to tell my sister this and she and her boyfriend had to go on stage and try to dance the time warp whoever lost the dance contest had to pretend he or she wa having sex with a large stuffed gumby doll so i quickly showed my sister and her boyfriend how to dance the time warp so they wouldn t lose the contest it wa fun watching my sister dance the time warp on stage but i don t think i could have handled her pretending to have sex with a large stuffed gumby i asked my sister if she wanted to come to craig s for the party afterward but she said that one of her friend wa having a party so she wa going to that that wa okay with me because at least she came to the show and before she left she hugged me again two in one day i really do love my sister especially when she s nice the party at craig s wa great craig and peter bought champagne to congratulate all the people who were graduating and we danced and we talked and i saw mary elizabeth kissing peter and looking happy and i saw sam kissing craig and looking happy and i saw patrick and alice not even care that they weren t kissing anybody because they were too excited talking about their future so i just sat there with a bottle of champagne near the cd player and i changed the song to fit the mood of what i saw i wa lucky too because craig ha an excellent collection when people looked a little tired i played something fun when they looked like they wanted to talk i played something soft it wa a great way to sit alone at a party and still feel a part of thing after the party everyone thanked me because they said it wa the perfect music craig said that i should be a deejay to make money while i wa still in school just like he doe modeling i thought that wa a good idea maybe i could save up a lot of money so i would be able to go to college even if something like the rotary club or moose lodge didn t come through my brother said recently on the phone that if he make it to the pro i don t have to worry about my college money at all he said he d take care of it i can t wait to see my brother he s coming home for my sister s graduation which is so nice love always charlie june dear friend it is now prom night and i am sitting in my room yesterday wa difficult because i didn t know anybody since all my friend and my sister were no longer in school the worst wa lunchtime because it reminded me of when everyone wa angry with me for mary elizabeth i couldn t even eat my sandwich and my mom made my favorite because i think she knew how sad i would be with everyone gone the hall seemed different and the junior were acting different because they are now the senior they even had t shirt made i don t know who plan these thing all i can think about is the fact that sam is leaving in two week to go to penn state and mary elizabeth is going to be busy with her guy and my sister is going to be busy with hers and alice and i aren t that close i know patrick will be around but i m afraid that maybe since he isn t sad he won t want to spend time with me i know that s wrong in my head but it feel that way sometimes so then the only person i would have to talk to would be my psychiatrist and i don t like the idea of that right now because he keep asking me question about when i wa younger and they re starting to get weird i m just lucky that i have so much schoolwork and don t have a lot of time to think all i hope is that tonight is great for the people whom it s supposed to be great for my sister s boyfriend showed up in his buick and he wa wearing a white tail coat over a black suit which looked wrong for some reason his cumberbunn i don t know how to spell this matched my sister s dress which wa powder blue and low cut it reminded me of those magazine i have to stop spinning out like this okay all i hope is that my sister feel beautiful and her new guy make her feel beautiful i hope that craig doesn t make sam feel that her prom isn t special just because he s older i hope the same for mary elizabeth with peter i hope brad and patrick decide to make up and dance in front of the whole school and that alice is secretly a lesbian and in love with brad s girlfriend nancy and vice versa so nobody feel left out i hope the deejay is a good a everyone said i wa last friday and i hope everyone s picture turn out great and never become old photograph and nobody get in a car accident that is what i really hope june dear friend love always charlie i just got home from school and my sister is still asleep from the after prom party the school organized i called over to patrick and sam s but they re still asleep too patrick and sam have a cordless phone which always run out of battery and sam s mom sounded like a mom in the peanut cartoon wah wah wuh i had two final today one in biology which i think i got a perfect in the other in bill s class the final wa about the great gatsby the only thing hard about it wa the fact that he had me read the book so long ago and it wa difficult to remember after i handed in the final i asked bill if he wanted me to write an essay about the fountainhead since i told him that i had finished it and he hadn t told me to do anything he said that it wouldn t be fair to have me write another essay when i have so many final this week instead he invited me over to his town house to spend saturday afternoon with his girlfriend and him which sound like fun so on friday i will go to rocky horror then on saturday i will go over to bill s town house then on sunday i will watch everyone graduate and spend time with my brother and all the family because of my sister then i ll probably go to sam and patrick s to celebrate their graduating then i ll have two more day of school which doesn t make sense because all my final will be over but they have some activity planned at least that s what i ve heard the reason i am thinking so far in advance is because school is terribly lonely i think i ve said that before but it s getting harder every day i have two final tomorrow history and typing then on friday i have final in all my other class like gym and shop i don t know if there will be actual final in these class especially shop i think mr callahan will just play some of his old record for u he did that when we were supposed to have a midterm too but it won t be the same without patrick lip synching incidentally i got a perfect on my math final last week love always charlie june dear friend i just got home from bill s house i would have written to you about last night this morning but i had to go to bill s last night craig and sam broke up it wa very sad to watch in the past few day i have heard a lot about the prom and thanks to those twenty four hour film place i have seen what everyone looked like sam looked beautiful patrick looked handsome mary elizabeth alice mary elizabeth s boyfriend all looked great too the only thing is that alice wore white stick deodorant with a strapless dress and it showed i don t think that kind of thing matter but supposedly alice wa paranoid about it all night craig looked handsome a well but he wore a suit instead of a tux that s not why they broke up actually the prom wa supposed to be very nice the limo wa really great and the limo driver got everyone stoned which made the very expensive food taste even better his name wa billy the prom s music came from this really bad cover band called the gypsy of the allegheny but the drummer wa good so everyone had a nice time dancing patrick and brad didn t even look at each other but sam said patrick wa really okay about it after the prom my sister and her boyfriend went to the after prom party the school organized it wa at this popular dance club downtown she said that it wa really fun with everyone all dressed up and dancing to good music played by a deejay instead of the gypsy of the allegheny they even had a comedian who did impersonation the only thing wa that once you went in you couldn t leave and come back i guess the parent thought that it would keep the kid out of trouble but nobody seemed to mind they were having too much fun and enough people smuggled in liquor anyway after the party it wa about seven o clock in the morning and everyone went to the big boy for pancake or bacon i asked patrick how he liked the after prom party and he said that it wa a lot of fun he said that craig had rented a hotel suite for all of them but only craig and sam went actually sam wanted to go to the after prom party the school organized too but craig got really angry because he already paid for the hotel suite that s not why they broke up it happened yesterday at craig s house after rocky horror like i said mary elizabeth s boyfriend peter is good friend with craig and he kind of stepped into the middle of thing i guess he really like mary elizabeth a lot and ha grown to like sam quite a bit because he s the one who brought it up nobody even suspected basically craig had been cheating on sam ever since they started going out and when i say cheat i don t mean he got drunk once and fooled around with one girl and felt bad about it there were several girl several time drunk and sober and i guess he never felt bad the reason peter didn t say anything at first wa the fact that he didn t know anybody and he didn t know sam he just thought she wa this dumb high school girl because that s what craig always told him anyway after he got to know sam peter kept telling craig that craig had to tell her the truth because she wasn t just some dumb high school girl craig kept promising he would but he never did it there wa always some excuse craig called them reason i don t want to ruin the prom for her i don t want to ruin graduation for her i don t want to ruin the show for her then finally craig said there wa no point telling her anything at all she wa about to go away to college anyway she would find a new guy he wa always safe about other girl there wa nothing to worry about in that way and why not just let sam remember the whole experience in a good way because he really liked sam and didn t want to hurt her feeling peter went along with this logic even though he thought it wa wrong at least that s what he said but then after the show yesterday craig told him that he fooled around with yet another girl the afternoon of the prom that s when peter told craig that if craig didn t say something to sam he would well craig didn t say anything and peter still didn t think it wa his business but then he overheard sam at the party she wa talking to mary elizabeth about how craig might be the one and how she wa trying to think of way to keep it going long distance while she wa at school letter phone call vacation and break that wa it for peter he went up to craig and said you tell her something now or i tell her everything so craig pulled sam into his bedroom they were in there for a while then sam walked from the bedroom straight out the front door silently sobbing craig didn t run after her that wa probably the worst part not that he should have tried to get back together with her but i think he should have run after her anyway all i know is that sam wa devastated mary elizabeth and alice went after her to make sure she wa okay i would have gone too but patrick grabbed my arm to stay he wanted to know what wa going on i guess or maybe he figured sam would be better off with female company i m glad that we stayed though because i think our presence prevented a pretty violent fight between craig and peter because we were there all they really did wa scream at each other that s where i heard most of the detail i m writing to you about craig would say fuck you peter fuck you and peter would say don t blame me that you fucked around on her since the beginning the afternoon of her prom you re just a bastard you hear me a fucking bastard thing like that when it looked like thing were going to get violent patrick stepped between the two and with my help got peter out of the apartment when we got outside the girl were gone so patrick and i got into patrick s car and drove peter home he wa still seething so he vented about craig that s where i heard the rest of the detail i m writing to you about finally we dropped peter off and he made u promise to make sure mary elizabeth didn t think he wa cheating on her because he wasn t he just didn t want to be found guilty by association with that prick we promised and he went into his apartment building patrick and i weren t sure how much craig actually told sam we both hoped he gave her a soft version of the truth enough to make her stay away but not enough to make her doubt everything about everything maybe it s better to know the whole truth i honestly don t know so we just made a pact that we wouldn t tell her unless we found out that craig made it sound like nothing big and sam wa ready to forgive him i hope it doesn t come to that i hope craig told her enough to make her stay away we drove around to all the place where we thought we might find the girl but we couldn t find them patrick figured they were probably just driving around trying to let sam cool off a bit so patrick dropped me at home he said he d call me tomorrow when he heard anything i remember going to sleep last night and i realized something something that i think is important i realized that throughout the course of the evening i wasn t happy about craig and sam breaking up not at all i never once thought that it would mean sam might start liking me all i cared about wa the fact that sam got really hurt and i guess i realized at that moment that i really did love her because there wa nothing to gain and that didn t matter it wa hard walking up the step to bill s town house that afternoon because i didn t receive a phone call all morning from patrick and i wa so worried about sam i called on the phone but nobody wa there bill look different without a suit he wa wearing his old graduate school t shirt which wa brown the school not the color his girlfriend wa wearing sandal and a nice flowered dress she even had hair under her arm no kidding they looked very happy together and i wa glad for bill their house didn t have a lot of furniture in it but it wa very comfortable they had a lot of book which i spent about a half an hour asking them about there wa also a picture of bill and his girlfriend when they were at brown together in graduate school bill had very long hair then bill s girlfriend made lunch while bill made the salad i just sat in the kitchen drinking a ginger ale and watching them the lunch wa a spaghetti dish of some sort because bill s girlfriend doesn t eat meat bill doesn t eat meat either now the salad did have imitation bacon bit though because bacon is the only thing they both miss they had a really nice collection of jazz record and they kept playing them all through lunch after a while they broke open a bottle of white wine and gave me another ginger ale then we started talking bill asked me about the fountainhead and i told him making sure that i wa a filter then he asked me about how i liked my first year of high school and i told him making sure that i included all the story in which i participated then he asked me about girl and i told him how i really loved sam and how i wondered what the lady who wrote the fountainhead would say about how i came to realize that i loved her after i finished bill got very quiet he cleared his throat charlie i want to thank you why i said because it ha been a wonderful experience teaching you oh i m glad i didn t know what else to say then bill took this really long pause and his voice sounded like my dad when he want to have a big talk charlie he said do you know why i gave you all that extra work i shook my head no that look on his face it made me quiet charlie do you know how smart you are i just shook my head no again he wa talking for real it wa strange charlie you re one of the most gifted people i ve ever known and i don t mean in term of my other student i mean in term of anyone i ve ever met that s why i gave you the extra work i wa wondering if you were aware of that i guess so i don t know i felt really strange i didn t know where this wa coming from i just wrote some essay charlie please don t take this the wrong way i m not trying to make you feel uncomfortable i just want you to know that you re very special and the only reason i m telling you is that i don t know if anyone else ever ha i looked up at him and then i didn t feel strange i felt like i wanted to cry he wa being so nice to me and the way his girlfriend looked i knew that this meant a lot to him and i didn t know why it did so when the school year end and i m not your teacher anymore i want you to know that if you ever need anything or want to know about more book or want to show me anything you write or anything you can always come to me a a friend i do consider you a friend charlie i started cry a little bit i actually think his girlfriend wa too but bill wasn t he looked very solid i just remember wanting to hug him but i ve never done that before and i guess patrick and girl and family don t count i didn t say anything for a while because i didn t know what to say so finally i just said you re the best teacher i ever had and he said thank you and that wa that bill didn t try to make sure that i would see him next year if i needed anything he didn t ask me why i wa cry he just let me hear what he had to say in my own way and let thing be that wa probably the best part after a few minute it wa time for me to leave i don t know who decides these thing it just happens so we went to the door and bill s girlfriend hugged me goodbye which wa very nice considering i didn t know her except for today then bill extended his hand and i took it and we shook hand and i even sneaked in a quick hug before i said good bye when i wa driving home i just thought about the word special and i thought the last person who said that about me wa my aunt helen i wa very grateful to have heard it again because i guess we all forget sometimes and i think everyone is special in their own way i really do my brother get home tonight and everyone s graduation is tomorrow patrick still hasn t called i called him but no one wa home again so i decided to go out and buy everyone their graduation present i really haven t had time to do that until now love always charlie june dear friend i just rode home on the bus it wa the last day of school for me today and it wa raining when i do ride the bus i usually sit toward the middle because i ve heard sitting in the front is for nerd and sitting in the back is for squid and the whole thing make me nervous i don t know what they call squid in other school anyway today i decided to sit in the front with my leg over the whole seat kind of like i wa lying down with my back to the window i did this so i could look back at the other kid on the bus i m glad school bus don t have seat belt or else i wouldn t have been able to do it the one thing i noticed wa how different everyone looked when we were all little we used to sing song on the bus ride home from the last day of school the favorite song wa a pink floyd song i found out later called another brick in the wall part ii but there wa this other song we loved even more because it ended with a swear it went like this no more pencil no more book no more teacher dirty look when the teacher ring the bell drop your book and run like hell when we finished we looked at the bus driver for a tense second then we all laughed because we knew we could get in trouble for swearing but the strength of our number would prevent any retribution we were too young to know that the bus driver didn t care about our song that all he wanted to do wa go home after work and maybe sleep off the drink he had at lunch back then it didn t matter the nerd and the squid were one my brother came home saturday night and he looked even more different than the kid on the school bus looked compared to the beginning of the year he had a beard i wa so happy he also smiled different and wa more courteous we all sat down to dinner and everyone asked him question about college dad asked about football mom asked about class i asked for all the fun story my sister asked nervous question about what college is really like and would she put on the freshman fifteen i don t know what this is but i m guessing it mean you get fatter i wa expecting my brother to just talk and talk about himself for a long time he would do that whenever there wa a big game in high school or the prom or something but he seemed a lot more interested in what we were all doing especially my sister with her graduation so while they were talking i suddenly remembered the tv news sport man and what he said about my brother i got so excited and i told my whole family and this is what happened a a result my dad said hey how about that my brother said really i said yeah i talked to him my brother said did he say something good my father said any press is good press i don t know where my father learns these thing my brother kept going what did he say i said well i think he said that college sport put a lot of pressure on the student who do them my brother kept nodding but he said that it built character and he said that penn state wa looking really good with their recruitment and he mentioned you my dad said hey how about that my brother said really i said yeah i talked to him my brother said when did you talk to him i said a couple week ago and then i froze because i suddenly remembered the other part the fact that i met the man in the park at night and the fact that i gave him one of my cigarette and the fact that he wa trying to pick me up i just sat there hoping it would go away but it didn t where did you meet him honey my mom asked the room turned pin and needle quiet and i did my best impersonation of myself when i can t remember something and here s what s going on inside my head okay he came to school to have a talk with the class no my sister would know it wa a lie i met him at the big boy he wa with his family no my dad would scold me for bothering the poor man he said it on a news cast but i said i talked to him wait in the park i wa there with patrick i said my dad said wa he there with his family did you bother the poor man no he wa alone that wa enough for my dad and everybody else and i didn t even have to lie luckily the attention wa turned off me when my mother said what she like to say when we re all together celebrating something who s in the mood for ice cream everyone wa except for my sister i think she wa worried about the freshman fifteen the next morning started early i still hadn t heard from patrick or sam or anybody but i knew i would see them at graduation so i tried not to worry too much all my relative including my dad s family from ohio came to the house around ten a m the two family really don t like each other except for all u younger cousin because we don t know any better we had this big brunch with champagne and just like last year for my brother s graduation my mom gave her dad my grandfather sparkling apple juice instead of champagne because she didn t want him to get drunk and make a scene and he said the same thing he said last year this is good champagne i don t think he knew the difference because he s a beer drinker sometimes whiskey around twelve thirty brunch wa over all the cousin drove all the car because the adult were still a little too drunk to drive to the graduation except for my dad because he wa too busy videotaping everyone with a camera he rented from the video store why buy a camera when you only need it three time a year so my sister brother dad mom and i each had to go in a different car to make sure nobody got lost i went with all my ohio cousin who promptly pulled out a joint and passed it around i didn t smoke any of it because i wasn t in the mood and they said what they always say charlie you re such a pussy so all the car pulled into the parking lot and we all got out and my sister yelled at my cousin mike for rolling down the window while he wa driving and messing up her hair i wa smoking a cigarette wa his reply couldn t you wait ten minute wa my sister s but it wa a great song wa his final word so a my dad wa getting the video camera out of the trunk and my brother wa talking to some of the graduating girl who were a year older and looking good my sister went for my mom to get my mom s purse the great thing about my mom s purse is that no matter what you need at any given moment she ha it when i wa little i used to call it the first aid kit because that s all we needed back then i still can t figure out how she doe it after primping my sister followed the trail of graduation cap to the field and we all found our way to the bleacher i sat in between my mom and brother since my dad wa off getting a better camera angle and my mom kept shushing my grandfather who kept talking about how many black people were in the school when she couldn t stop him she mentioned my story about the tv news sport man talking about my brother this made my grandfather call my brother over to talk about it this wa smart on my mom s part because my brother is the only person who can get my grandfather to stop making a scene because he s really direct about it after the story this is what happened jesus look at these bleacher how many colored people my brother cut him off okay grandpa here s the deal if you embarrass u one more time i m going to drive you back to the nursing home and you ll never see your granddaughter give a speech my brother is real tough but then you won t see the speech either big shot my grandfather s real tough too yeah but my dad is videotaping it and i can arrange it so i get to see the tape and you don t can t i my grandfather ha a really weird smile especially when someone else win he didn t say anything more about it he just started talking about football and didn t even mention anything about my brother playing on a team with black kid i can t tell you how bad it wa last year since my brother wa on the field graduating instead of up in the bleacher making my grandfather stop while they were talking football i kept looking for patrick and sam but all i saw were those graduation cap in the distance when the music started the cap started marching toward the folding chair set up on the field that s when i finally saw sam walking behind patrick i wa so relieved i couldn t really tell if she wa happy or sad but it wa enough just to see her and know that she wa there when all the kid got in the chair the music stopped and mr small got up and gave a speech about what a wonderful class this wa he mentioned some of the achievement the school had made and he emphasized how much they needed support at the community day bake sale to start a new computer lab then he introduced the class president who gave a speech i don t know what class president do but the girl gave a very good speech then it wa time for the five top honor student to give a speech that s the tradition in the school my sister wa second in her class so she gave the fourth speech the valedictorian is always last then mr small and the vice principal whom patrick swears is gay hand out the diploma the first three speech were very similar they all had quote from pop song that had something to do with the future and all through the speech i could see my mother s hand she wa gripping them tighter and tighter together when they announced my sister s name my mom uncoiled into applause it wa really great watching my sister get on the podium because my brother wa something like rd in his class and consequently didn t get to give a speech and maybe i m biased but when my sister quoted a pop song and talked about the future it seemed great i looked over at my brother and he looked over at me and we both smiled then we looked at my mother and she wa cry real soft and messy so my brother and i each took one of her hand she looked at u and smiled and cried harder then we both rested our head on her shoulder like a sideways hug which made her cry even harder or maybe it let her cry even harder i m not sure which but she gave our hand a little squeeze and said my boy real soft and went back to cry i love my mom so much i don t care if that s corny to say i think on my next birthday i m going to buy her a present i think that should be the tradition the kid get gift from everybody and he buy one present for his mom since she wa there too i think that would be nice when my sister finished her speech we all clapped and yelled but nobody clapped or yelled louder than my grandfather nobody i don t remember what the valedictorian said except that she quoted henry david thoreau instead of a pop song then mr small got up on the stage and asked everyone to refrain from applause until all the name were read and all the diploma were handed out i should mention that this didn t work last year either so i saw my sister get her diploma and my mother cry again and then i saw mary elizabeth and i saw alice and i saw patrick and i saw sam it wa a great day even when i saw brad it seemed okay we all met my sister in the parking lot and the first one to hug her wa my grandfather he really is a proud man in his way everyone said how much they loved my sister s speech even if they didn t then we all saw my father walking across the parking lot holding the video camera above his head triumphantly i don t think anybody hugged my sister longer than my dad i looked around for sam and patrick but i couldn t find them anywhere on the way home for the party my ohio cousin lit up another joint this time i took a hit but they still called me a pussy i don t know why maybe that s just what ohio cousin do that and tell joke what ha leg and tooth what we all asked a west virginia unemployment line thing like that when we got home my ohio cousin went straight for the bar because graduation seem to be the one occasion where anyone can drink at least it wa like that last year and this year i wonder what my graduation will be like it seems very far away so my sister spent the first hour of the party opening up all the gift and her smile grew with each check sweater or fifty dollar bill nobody in our family is rich but it seems like everybody save up just enough for these kind of event and we all pretend we re rich for a day the only people who didn t get my sister money or a sweater were my brother and i my brother promised to take her out one day to shop for college thing like soap which he would pay for and i bought her a little house that wa hand carved out of stone and painted in england i told her i wanted to give her something that make her feel like she s at home even after she go away my sister actually kissed my cheek for that but the best part of the party happened when my mother came to me and said i had a phone call i went to the phone hello charlie sam when are you coming over she asked now i said then my father who wa drinking a whiskey sour growled you re not going anywhere until your relative leave you hear me uh sam i have to wait for my relative to leave i said okay we ll be here until seven then we ll call you from wherever we are sam really sounded happy okay sam congratulation thanks charlie bye bye i hung up the phone i swear to you i thought my relative would never leave every story they told every pig in a blanket they ate every photograph they looked at and every time i heard when you were this high with the appropriate gesture it wa like the clock stopped it s not that i minded the story because i didn t and the pig in blanket were quite good but i wanted to see sam at about everyone wa stuffed and sober at the hug were over at the driveway wa clear my father gave me twenty dollar and the key to his car saying thanks for sticking around it meant a lot to me and the family he wa tipsy but meant it just the same sam had told me they were going to a dance club downtown so i loaded everyone s gift in my trunk climbed in the car and drove away there s something about that tunnel that lead to downtown it s glorious at night just glorious you start on one side of the mountain and it s dark and the radio is loud a you enter the tunnel the wind get sucked away and you squint from the light overhead when you adjust to the light you can see the other side in the distance just a the sound of the radio fade to nothing because the wave just can t reach then you re in the middle of the tunnel and everything becomes a calm dream a you see the opening get closer you just can t get there fast enough and finally just when you think you ll never get there you see the opening right in front of you and the radio come back even louder than you remember it and the wind is waiting and you fly out of the tunnel onto the bridge and there it is the city a million light and building and everything seems a exciting a the first time you saw it it really is a grand entrance after about half an hour looking around the dance club i finally saw mary elizabeth with peter they were both drinking scotch and soda which peter bought since he is older and had his hand stamped i congratulated mary elizabeth and asked where everybody wa she told me that alice wa getting high in the lady room and sam and patrick were on the floor dancing she said to just have a seat until they come back because she didn t know where they were specifically so i sat down and listened to peter argue with mary elizabeth about the democratic candidate again the clock seemed to stop i wanted to see sam that badly after about three song sam and patrick came back completely coated in sweat charlie i stood up and we all hugged like we hadn t seen each other in month considering everything that happened i guess that make sense after we let go patrick lay on top of peter and mary elizabeth like they were a sofa then he took mary elizabeth s drink out of her hand and drank it hey asshole wa her response i think he wa drunk even though he hasn t been drinking lately but patrick doe that stuff sober so it s hard to tell that s when sam grabbed my hand i love this song she led me to the dance floor and she started dancing and i started dancing it wa a fast song so i wasn t very good but she didn t seem to mind we were just dancing and that wa enough the song ended and then a slow one came on she looked at me i looked at her then she took my hand and pulled me in to dance slow i don t know how to dance slow very well either but i do know how to sway her whisper smelled like cranberry juice and vodka i looked for you in the parking lot today i hoped mine still smelled like toothpaste i wa looking for you too then we were quiet for the rest of the song she held me a little closer i held her a little closer and we kept dancing it wa the one time all day that i really wanted the clock to stop and just be there for a long time after the dance club we went back to peter s apartment and i gave everyone their graduation present i gave alice a film book about night of the living dead which she liked and i gave mary elizabeth a copy of my life a a dog on videotape with the subtitle in it which she loved then i gave patrick and sam their present i even wrapped them up special i used the sunday funny paper because they are in color patrick tore through his sam didn t rip any of the paper she just plucked off the tape and they looked at what wa inside each box i gave patrick on the road naked lunch the stranger this side of paradise peter pan and a separate peace i gave sam to kill a mockingbird the catcher in the rye the great gatsby hamlet walden and the fountainhead under the book wa a card that i wrote using the typewriter sam bought me the card said that these were my copy of all my favorite book and i wanted sam and patrick to have them because they were my two favorite people in the whole world when they both looked up from reading they were quiet nobody smiled or cried or did anything we were just open looking at each other they knew i meant the card i wrote and i knew it meant a lot to them what do the card say mary elizabeth asked do you mind charlie patrick asked i shook my head no and they each read their card while i went to fill up my coffee cup with red wine when i came back they all looked at me and i said i m going to miss you all very much i hope you have a great time at college and then i started cry because it suddenly hit me that they were all leaving i think peter think i m a little strange so sam stood up and took me into the kitchen telling me on the way there that it wa okay when we got to the kitchen i wa a little more calm sam said you know i m leaving in a week charlie yeah i know don t start cry again okay i want you to listen okay i m really scared to be alone at college you are i asked i never really thought of that before just like you re really scared to be alone here okay i nodded so i ll make you a deal when thing get to be too much at college i ll call you and when thing get to be too much here you call me could we write letter back and forth of course she said then i started cry again i really am a roller coaster sometimes but sam wa patient charlie i m going to be back at the end of the summer but before we think about that let s just enjoy this last week together all of u okay i nodded and calmed down we spent the rest of the night just drinking and listening to music like we always did but this time it wa at peter s and it wa better than craig s actually because peter ha a better music collection it wa about one o clock in the morning when it suddenly occurred to me oh my god i said what s wrong charlie tomorrow s a school day i don t think i could have made them laugh harder peter took me into the kitchen to make coffee so i could sober up to drive home i had about eight cup in a row and wa ready to drive in about twenty minute the problem wa by the time i got home i wa so awake from the coffee i couldn t fall asleep by the time i got to school i felt like dying luckily all the final were over and all we did all day wa watch film strip i don t think i ever slept better i wa glad too because school really is lonely without them today wa different because i didn t sleep and i didn t get to see sam or patrick last night because they were having a special dinner out with their parent and my brother wa on a date with one of the girl who wa looking good at graduation my sister wa busy with her boyfriend and my mom and dad were still tired from the graduation party today pretty much every teacher just let the kid sit around and talk after we handed in our textbook i honestly didn t know anybody except maybe for susan but after that time in the hallway she s avoided me more than ever so i didn t really talk the only good class wa bill s because i got to talk to bill it wa hard saying good bye to him after class wa over but he said that it wasn t good bye i could call him anytime over the summer if i wanted to talk or borrow book and that made me feel a little better this one kid with crooked teeth named leonard called me a teacher s pet in the hallway after bill s class but i didn t mind because i think he missed the point somewhere i ate lunch outside on a bench where we all used to smoke after i ate my ho ho i lit up a cigarette and i wa kind of hoping someone would ask me for one but no one did when the last class wa over everyone wa cheering and making plan with each other for the summer and everyone wa clearing out their locker by throwing their old paper and note and book on the hallway floor when i got to my locker i saw this skinny kid who had the locker next to me all year i had never really talked to him before i cleared my throat and said hey my name is charlie all he said wa i know then he closed his locker door and walked away so i just opened my locker put all my old paper and thing in my backpack and walked over the debris of book and paper and note in the hallway to the parking lot outside then i got on the bus then i wrote this letter to you i m actually really glad that the school year is over i want to spend a lot of time with everyone before they leave especially sam by the way i ended up getting straight a s this whole year my mother wa very proud and put my report card on the refrigerator june love always charlie dear friend the night before sam wa going to leave made the whole week a blur sam wa frantic because not only did she need to spend time with u but she had to get ready to go buying thing packing thing thing like that every night we would all get together after sam had just said good bye to some uncle or had another lunch with her mom or had done more shopping for school thing she wa scared and it wasn t until she had a sip of whatever we were drinking or a hit off of whatever we were smoking that she would calm down and be the same sam the one thing that really helped sam through her week wa her lunch with craig she said she wanted to see him to have some kind of closure and i guess she wa lucky enough to get it because craig wa nice enough to tell her that she wa right to break up with him and that she wa a special person and that he wa sorry and wished her well it s strange the time people choose to be generous the best part wa that sam said she didn t ask him about the girl he might be dating even though she wanted to know she wasn t bitter she wa sad though but it wa a hopeful kind of sad the kind of sad that just take time on the night before she left we were all there at sam and patrick s house bob alice mary elizabeth without peter and i we just sat on the rug in the game room remembering thing remember the show where patrick did this or remember when bob did this or charlie or mary elizabeth or alice or sam the inside joke weren t joke anymore they had become story nobody brought up the bad name or the bad time and nobody felt sad a long a we could postpone tomorrow with more nostalgia after a while mary elizabeth and bob and alice left saying they would be back in the morning to see sam off so it wa just me patrick and sam just sitting there not saying much until we started our own remember when remember when charlie first came to u at the football game and remember when charlie let the air our of dave s tire at the homecoming dance and remember the poem and the mix tape and punk rocky in color and remember when we all felt infinite after i said that we all got quiet and sad in the silence i remembered this one time that i never told anybody about the time we were walking just the three of u and i wa in the middle i don t remember where we were walking to or where we were walking from i don t even remember the season i just remember walking between them and feeling for the first time that i belonged somewhere finally patrick stood up i m tired guy good night then he messed up our hair and went up to his room sam turned to me charlie i have to pack up some thing would you stay with me for a while i nodded and we went upstairs a we entered her room i noticed how different it looked from the night sam kissed me the picture were down and the dresser were empty and everything wa in a big pile on the bed i said to myself that i would not cry no matter what because i didn t want to make sam feel any more panicked than she already wa so i just watched her pack and i tried to notice a many detail a i possibly could her long hair and her thin wrist and her green eye i wanted to remember everything especially the sound of her voice sam talked about a lot of thing trying to keep herself distracted she talked about what a long drive they had tomorrow and how her parent had rented a van she wondered what her class would be like and what her eventual major would be she said she didn t want to join a sorority but wa looking forward to the football game she wa just getting more and more sad finally she turned around why didn t you ask me out when the whole craig thing happened i just sat there i didn t know what to say she said it soft charlie after that thing with mary elizabeth at the party and u dancing at the club and everything i didn t know what to say honestly i wa lost okay charlie i ll make this easy when that whole thing with craig happened what did you think she really wanted to know i said well i thought a lot of thing but mostly i thought that your being sad wa much more important to me than craig not being your boyfriend anymore and if it meant that i would never get to think of you that way a long a you were happy it wa okay that s when i realized that i really loved you she sat down on the floor with me she spoke quiet charlie don t you get it i can t feel that it s sweet and everything but it s like you re not even there sometimes it s great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone but what about when someone doesn t need a shoulder what if they need the arm or something like that you can t just sit there and put everybody s life ahead of yours and think that count a love you just can t you have to do thing like what i asked my mouth wa dry i don t know like take their hand when the slow song come up for a change or be the one who asks someone for a date or tell people what you need or what you want like on the dance floor did you want to kiss me yeah i said then why didn t you she asked real serious because i didn t think you wanted me to why did you think that because of what you said what i said nine month ago when i told you not to think of me that way i nodded charlie i also told you not to tell mary elizabeth she wa pretty and to ask her a lot of question and not interrupt her now she s with a guy who doe the exact opposite and it work because that s who peter really is he s being himself and he doe thing but i didn t like mary elizabeth charlie you re missing the point the point is that i don t think you would have acted different even if you did like mary elizabeth it s like you can come to patrick s rescue and hurt two guy that are trying to hurt him but what about when patrick s hurting himself like when you guy went to that park or when he wa kissing you did you want him to kiss you i shook my head no so why did you let him i wa just trying to be a friend i said but you weren t charlie at those time you weren t being his friend at all because you weren t honest with him i sat there very still i looked at the floor i didn t say anything very uncomfortable charlie i told you not to think of me that way nine month ago because of what i m saying now not because of craig not because i didn t think you were great it s just that i don t want to be somebody s crush if somebody like me i want them to like the real me not what they think i am and i don t want them to carry it around inside i want them to show me so i can feel it too i want them to be able to do whatever they want around me and if they do something i don t like i ll tell them she wa starting to cry a little but she wasn t sad you know i blamed craig for not letting me do thing you know how stupid i feel about that now maybe he didn t really encourage me to do thing but he didn t prevent me from doing them either but after a while i didn t do thing because i didn t want him to think different about me but the thing is i wasn t being honest so why would i care whether or not he loved me when he didn t really even know me i looked up at her she had stopped cry so tomorrow i m leaving and i m not going to let that happen again with anyone else i m going to do what i want to do i m going to be who i really am and i m going to figure out what that is but right now i m here with you and i want to know where you are what you need and what you want to do she waited patiently for my answer but after everything she said i figured that i should just do what i wanted to do not think about it not say it out loud and if she didn t like it then she could just say so and we could go back to packing so i kissed her and she kissed me back and we lay down on the floor and kept kissing and it wa soft and we made quiet noise and kept silent and still we went over to the bed and lay down on all the thing that weren t put in suitcase and we touched each other from the waist up over our clothes and then under our clothes and then without clothes and it wa so beautiful she wa so beautiful she took my hand and slid it under her pant and i touched her and i just couldn t believe it it wa like everything made sense until she moved her hand under my pant and she touched me that s when i stopped her what s wrong she asked did that hurt i shook my head it felt good actually i didn t know what wa wrong i m sorry i didn t mean to no don t be sorry i said but i feel bad she said please don t feel bad it wa very nice i said i wa starting to get really upset you re not ready she asked i nodded but that wasn t it i didn t know what it wa it s okay that you re not ready she said she wa being really nice to me but i wa just feeling so bad charlie do you want to go home she asked i guess i nodded because she helped me get dressed and then she put on her shirt and i wanted to kick myself for being such a baby because i loved sam and we were together and i wa ruining it just ruining it just terrible i felt so terrible she took me outside do you need a ride she asked i had my father s car i wasn t drunk she looked really worried no thanks charlie i m not going to let you drive like this i m sorry i ll walk then i said it s two o clock in the morning i m driving you home she went to another room to get the car key i just stood in the entry hall i felt like i wanted to die you re white a a sheet charlie do you need some water no i don t know i started to cry really hard here just lie down on the couch she said she laid me down on the couch she brought out a damp washcloth and put it on my forehead you can sleep here tonight okay okay just calm down take deep breath i did what she told me and just before i fell asleep i said something i can t do that anymore i m sorry i said it s okay charlie just go to sleep sam said but i wasn t talking to sam anymore i wa talking to someone else when i fell asleep i had this dream my brother and my sister and i were watching television with my aunt helen everything wa in slow motion the sound wa thick and she wa doing what sam wa doing that s when i woke up and i didn t know what the hell wa going on sam and patrick were standing over me patrick asked if i wanted some breakfast i guess i nodded we went and ate sam still looked worried patrick looked normal we had bacon and egg with their parent and everyone made small talk i don t know why i m telling you about bacon and egg it s not important it s not important at all mary elizabeth and everyone came over and while sam s mom wa busy checking everything twice we all walked to the driveway sam and patrick s parent got in the van patrick got in the driver s side of sam s pickup truck telling everyone he d see them in a couple of day then sam hugged and said good bye to everyone since she wa coming back for a few day toward the end of the summer it wa more of a see ya than a good bye i wa last sam walked up and held me for a long time finally she whispered in my ear she said a lot of wonderful thing about how it wa okay that i wasn t ready last night and how she would miss me and how she wanted me to take care of myself while she wa gone you re my best friend wa all i could say in return she smiled and kissed my cheek and it wa like for a moment the bad part of last night disappeared but it still felt like a goodbye rather than a see ya the thing wa i didn t cry i didn t know what i felt finally sam climbed into her pickup and patrick started it up and a great song wa playing and everyone smiled including me but i wasn t there anymore it wasn t until i couldn t see the car that i came back and thing started feeling bad again but this time they felt much worse mary elizabeth and everyone were cry now and they asked me if i wanted to go to the big boy or something i told them no thank you i need to go home are you okay charlie mary elizabeth asked i guess i wa starting to look bad again because she looked worried i m fine i m just tired i lied i got in my dad s car and drove away and i could hear all these song on the radio but the radio wasn t on and when i got into the driveway i think i forgot to turn off the car i just went to the couch in the family room where the tv is and i could see the tv show but the tv wasn t on i don t know what s wrong with me it s like all i can do is keep writing this gibberish to keep from breaking apart sam s gone and patrick won t be home for a few day and i just couldn t talk with mary elizabeth or anybody or my brother or anybody in my family except maybe my aunt helen but she s gone and even if she were here i don t think i could talk to her either because i m starting to feel like what i dreamt about her last night wa true and my psychiatrist s question weren t weird after all i don t know what i m supposed to do now i know other people have it a lot worse i do know that but it s crashing in anyway and i just can t stop thinking that the little kid eating french fry with his mom in the shopping mall is going to grow up and hit my sister i d do anything not to think that i know i m thinking too fast again and it s all in my head like the trance but it s there and it won t go away i just keep seeing him and he keep hitting my sister and he won t stop and i want him to stop because he doesn t mean it but he just doesn t listen and i don t know what to do i m sorry but i have to stop this letter now but first i want to thank you for being one of those people who listens and understands and doesn t try to sleep with people even though you could have i really mean it and i m sorry i ve put you through this when you don t even know who i am and we ve never met in person and i can t tell you who i am because i promised to keep all those little secret i just don t want you to think that i picked your name out of the phone book it would kill me if you thought that so please believe me when i tell you that i felt terrible after michael died and i saw a girl in class who didn t notice me and she talked all about you to a friend of hers and even though i didn t know you i felt like i did because you sounded like such a good person the kind of person who wouldn t mind receiving letter from a kid the kind of person who would understand how they were better than a diary because there is communion and a diary can be found i just don t want you to worry about me or think that you ve met me or waste your time anymore i m so sorry that i wasted your time because you really do mean a lot to me and i hope you have a very nice life because i really think you deserve it i really do i hope you do too okay then goodbye love always charlie seabird squawking belly my family s been going
