across the flooded road boat ply in the bazaar and small fish appear in the puddle that fill the pwd pothole on the highway it wa raining when rahel came back to ayemenem slanting silver rope slammed into loose earth ploughing it up like gun fire the old house on the hill wore it steep gabled roof pulled over it ear like a low hat the wall streaked with moss had grown soft and bulged a litde with dampness that seeped up from the ground the wild overgrown garden wa full of the whisper and scurry of small life in the undergrowth a rat i the god of small thing snake rubbed itself against a glistening stone hopeful yellow bullfrog cruised the scummy pond for mate a drenched mongoose flashed across the leaf strewn driveway the house itself looked empty the door and window were locked the front verandah bare unfurnished but the skyblue plymouth with chrome tailfin wa still parked outside and inside baby kochamma wa still alive she wa raheps baby grand aunt her grandfather s younger sister her name wa really navomi navomi ipe but every body called her baby she became baby kochamma when she wa old enough to be an aunt rahel hadn t come to see her though neither niece nor baby grand aunt laboured under any illusion on that account rahel had come to see her brother estha they were two egg twin dizygotic doctor called them bom from separate but simultaneously fertilized egg estha esthappen wa the older by eighteen minute they never did look much like each other estha and rahel and even when they were thin armed child flat chested worm ridden and elvis presley puffed there wa none of the usual who is who and which is which from oversmiling relative or the syrian orthodox bishop who frequently visited the ayemenem house for donation the confusion lay in a deeper more secret place in those early amorphous year when memory had only just begun when life wa full of beginning and no end and every thing wa for ever esthappen and rahel thought of themselves together a me and separately individually a we or u a though they were a rare breed of siamese twin physically separate but with joint identity now these year later rahel ha a memory of waking up one night giggling at estha s funny dream she ha other memory too that she ha no right to have she remembers for instance though she hadn t been there what the orangedrink lemondrink man did to estha in paradise pickle preserve abhilash talkie she remembers the taste of the tomato sand wiches estha s sandwich that estha ate on the madras mail to madras and these are only the small thing anyway now she think of estha and rahel a them because separately the two of them are no longer what were or ever thought the d be ever their life have a size and a shape now estha ha his and rahel hers edge border boundary brink and limit have appeared like a team of troll on their separate horizon short creature with long shadow patrolling the blurry end gentle half moon have gathered under their eye and they are a old a ammu wa when she died thirty one not old not young but a viable die able age they were nearly born on a bus estha and rahel the car in which baba their father wa taking ammu their mother to hospital in shillong to have them broke down on the winding tea estate road in assam they abandoned the car and flagged down a crowded state transport bus with the queer com passion of the very poor for the comparatively well off or per hap only because they saw how hugely pregnant ammu wa seated passenger made room for the couple and for the rest of the journey estha and rahefs father had to hold their mother s stomach with them in it to prevent it from wobbling that wa before they were divorced and ammu came back to live in kerala according to estha if they d been born on the bus they d have got free bus ride for the rest of their life it wasn t clear the god of small thing where he d got this information from or how he knew these thing but for year the twin harboured a faint resentment against their parent for having diddled them out of a lifetime of free bus ride they also believed that if they were killed on a zebra crossing the government would pay for their funeral they had the definite impression that that wa what zebra crossing were meant for free funeral of course there were no zebra crossing to get killed on in ayemenem or for that matter even in kottayam which wa the nearest town but they d seen some from the car window when they went to cochin which wa a two hour drive away the government never paid for sophie mol s funeral because she wasn t killed on a zebra crossing she had hers in ayemenem in the old church with the new paint she wa estha and rahel s cousin their uncle ghacko s daughter she wa visiting from england estha and rahel were seven year old when she died sophie mol wa almost nine she had a special child sized coffin satin lined brass handle shined she lay in it in her yellow crimplene bellbottoms with her hair in a ribbon and her made in england go go bag that she loved her face wa pale and a wrinkled a a dhobi s thumb from being in water for too long the congregation gathered around the coffin and the yellow church swelled like a throat with the sound of sad singing the priest with curly beard swung pot of frankincense on chain and never smiled at baby the way they did on usual sunday the long candle on the altar were bent the short one weren t an old lady masquerading a a distant relative whom nobody recognized but who often surfaced next to body at funercds paradise pickle preserve a funeral junkie a latent necrophiliac put cologne on a wad of cotton wool and with a devout and gendy challenging air dabbed it on sophie mofs forehead sophie mol smelled of cologne and coffinwood margaret kochamma sophie mol s english mother wouldn t let chacko sophie mol s biological father put his arm around her to comfort her the family stood huddled together margaret kochamma chacko baby kochamma and next to her her sister in law mammachi estha and rahel s and sophie mol s grand mother mammachi wa almost blind and always wore dark glass when she went out of the house her tear trickled dowm from behind them and trembled along her jaw like raindrop on the edge of a roof she looked small and ill in her crisp off white sari chacko wa mammachi s only son her own grief grieved her his devastated her though ammu estha and rahel were allowed to attend the funeral they were made to stand separately not with the rest of the family nobody would look at them it wa hot in the church and the white edge of the arum lily crisped and curled a bee died in a coffin flower ammu s hand shook and her hymnbook with it her skin wa cold estha stood close to her barely awake his aching eye glittering like glass his burning cheek against the bare skin of ammu s trembling hymnbook holding arm rahel on the other hand wa wide awake fiercely vigilant and brittle with exhaustion from her battle against real life she noticed that sophie mol wa awake for her funeral she showed rahel two thing thing one wa the newly painted high dome of the yellow church that rahel hadn t ever looked at from the inside it wa painted blue like the sky with drifting cloud and tiny whizzing jet plane with white trail that crisscrossed in the cloud it s true and must be said that it would have been easier to notice the god of small thing these thing lying in a coffin looking up than standing in the pew hemmed in by sad hip and hymnbook rahel thought of the someone who had taken the trouble to go up there with can of paint white for the cloud blue for the sky silver for the jet and brush and thinner she imagined him up there someone like velutha bare bodied and shining sitting on a plank swinging from the scaffolding in the high dome of the church painting silver jet in a blue church sky she thought of what would happen if the rope snapped she imagined him droppirig like a dark star out of the sky that he had made lying broken on the hot church floor dark blood spilling from his skull like a secret by then esthappen and rahel had learned that the world had other way of breaking men they were already familiar with the smell sicksweet like old rose on a breeze thing two that sophie mol showed rahel wa the bat baby during the funeral service rahel watched a small black bat climb up baby kochamma s expensive funeral sari with gently clinging curled claw when it reached the place between her sari and her blouse her roll of sadness her bare midriff baby kochamma screamed and hit the air with her hymnbook the singing stopped for a whatisit whathappened and for a furrywhirring and a sarifliapping the sad priest dusted out their curly beard with goldringed finger a though hidden spider had spun sudden cobweb in them the baby bat flew up into the sky and turned into a jet plane without a crisscrossed trail only rahel noticed sophie mofs secret cartwheel in her coffin the sad singing started again and they sang the same sad verse twice and once more the yellow church swelled like a throat with voice paradise pickle preserve when they lowered sophie mol s coffin into the ground in the little cemeteiy behind the church rahel knew that she still wasn t dead she heard on sophie mol s behalf the softsounds of the red mud and the hardsounds of the orange laterite that spoiled the shining coffin polish she heard the dullthudding through the polished coffin wood through the satin coffin lining the sad priest voice muffled by mud and wood ive entrust into thy hand most merciful father the soul of this our child departed and we commit her body to the ground earth to earth ash to ash dust to dust inside the earth sophie mol screamed and shredded satin with her teeth but you can t hear scream through earth and stone sophie mol died because she couldn t breathe her funeral killed her dus to dus to dus to dus to dus on her tombstone it said a sunbeam lent to u too brifiy ammu explained later that too briefly meant for too short a while after the funeral ammu took the twin back to the kottayam police station i hey were familiar with the place they had spent a good part of the previous day there anticipating the sharp smoky stink of old urine that permeated the wall and furniture they clamped their nostril shut well before the smell began ammu asked for the station house officer and when she wa shown into his office she told him that there had been a terrible mistake and that she wanted to make a statement she asked to see velutha inspector thomas mathew s moustache busded like the friendly air india maharajah s but his eye were sly and greedy it s a litde too late for all this don t you think he said he the god of small thing spoke the coarse kottayam dialect of malayalam he stared at ammu s breast a he spoke he said the police knew all they needed to know and that the kottayam police didn t take state ments from veshyas or their illegitimate child ammu said she d see about that inspector thomas mathew came around his desk and approached ammu with his baton if i were you he said i d go home quietly then he tapped her breast with his baton gently tap tap a though he wa choosing mango from a basket pointing out the one that he wanted packed and delivered inspector thomas mathew seemed to know whom he could pick on and whom he couldn t policeman have that instinct behind him a red and blue board said p oliteness obedience loyalty i ntelligence c ourtesy efficiency when they left the police station ammu wa cry so estha and rahel didn t ask her what vesica meant or for that matter ille timate it wa the first time they d seen their mother cry she wasn t sobbing her face wa set like stone but the tear welled up in her eye and ran down her rigid cheek it made the twin sick with fear ammu s tear made everything that had so far seemed unreal real they went back to ayemenem by bus the conductor a narrow man in khaki slid towards them on the bus rail he balanced his bony hip against the back of a seat and clicked his ticket puncher at ammu where to the click wa meant to mean rahel could smell the sheaf of bus ticket and the sourness of the steel bus rail on the conductor s hand he s dead ammu whispered to him i ve killed him paradise pickle preserve ayemenem estha said quickly before the conductor lost his temper he took the money out of ammu s purse the conductor gave him the ticket estha folded them carefully and put them in his pocket then he put his litde arm around his rigid weeping mother two week later estha wa returned ammu wa made to send him back to their father who had by then resigned his lonely tea estate job in assam and moved to calcutta to work for a company that made carbon black he had remarried stopped drinking more or less and suffered only occasional relapse estha and rahel hadn t seen each other since and now twenty three year later their father had re retumed estha he had sent him back to ayemenem with a suitcase and a letter the suitcase wa full of smart new clothes baby kochamma showed rahel the letter it wa written in a slanting feminine convent school hand but the signature underneath wa their father s or at least the name wa rahel wouldn t have recognized the signature the letter said that he their father had retired from his carbon black job and wa emigrating to australia where he had got a job a chief of security at a ceramic factory and that he couldn t take estha with him he wished everybody in ayemenem the very best and said that he would look in on estha if he ever came back to india which he went on to say wa a bit unlikely baby kochamma told rahel that she could keep the letter if she wanted to rahel put it back into it envelope the paper had grown soft and folded like cloth she had forgotten just how damp the monsoon air in aye menem could be swollen cupboard creaked locked window burst open book got soft and wavy between their cover strange insect appeared like idea in the evening and burned the god of small thing themselves on baby kochamma s dim watt bulb in the daytime their crisp incinerated corps littered the floor and windowsill and until kochu maria swept them away in her plastic dustpan the air smelled of something burning it hadn t changed the june rain heaven opened and the water hammered down reviving the reluctant old well greenmossing the pigless pigsty carpet bombing still tea coloured puddle the way memory bomb still tea coloured mind the grass looked wetgreen and pleased happy earthworm frolicked purple in the slush green nettle nodded tree bent further away in the wind and rain on the bank of the river in th sudden thunderdarkness of the day estha wa walking he wa wearing a crushed strawberry pink t shirt drenched darker now and he knew that rahel had come estha had always been a quiet child so no one could pinpoint with any degree of accuracy exactly when the year if not the month or day he had stopped talking stopped talking altogether that is the fact is that there wasn t an exactly when it had been a gradual winding down and closing shop a barely noticeable quietening a though he had simply run out of conversation and had nothing left to say yet estha s silence wa never awkward never intrusive never noisy it wasn t an accusing protesting silence a much a a sort of aestivation a dormancy the psychological equivalent of what lungfish do to get themselves through the dry season except that in estha s case the dry season looked a though it would last for ever over time he had acquired the ability to blend into the background of wherever he wa into bookshelf garden curtain doorway street to appear inanimate almost invis ible to the untrained eye it usually took stranger a while to notice him even when they were in the same room with him paradise pickle preserve it took them even longer to notice that he never spoke some never noticed at all estha occupied ery little space in the world after sophie mofs funeral when estha wa returned their father sent him to a boy school in calcutta he wa not an exceptional student but neither wa he backward nor particu larly bad at anything an average student or satisfactory work were the usual comment that his teacher wrote in his annual pro gress report doe not participate in group activity wa another recurring complaint though what exactly they meant by group activity they never said estha finished school with mediocre result but refused to go to college instead much to the initial embarrassment of his father and stepmother he began to do the housework a though in his own way he wa trying to earn his keep he did the sweeping swabbing and all the laundry he learned to cook and shop for vegetable vendor in the bazaar sitting behind pyramid of oiled shining vegetable grew to recognize him and would attend to him amidst the clamouring of their other customer they gave him rusted film can in which to put the vegetable he picked he never bargained they never cheated him when the vegetable had been weighed and paid for they would transfer them to his red plastic shopping basket onion at the bottom brinjal and tomato on the top and always a sprig of coriander and a fistful of green chilli for free estha carried them home in the crowded tram a quiet bubble floating on a sea of noise at meal time when he wanted something he got up and helped himself once the quietness arrived it stayed and spread in estha it reached out of his head and enfolded him in it swampy arm it rocked him to the rhythm of an ancient foetal heartbeat it sent it ste hhy suckered tentacle inching along the inside of ii the god of small thing his skull hoovering the knoll and dell of his memory dislodg ing old sentence whisking them off the tip of his tongue it stripped his thought of the word that described them and left them pared and naked unspeakable numb and to an observer therefore perhaps barely there slowly over the year estha withdrew from the world he grew accustomed to the uneasy octopus that lived inside him and squirted it inky tranquillizer on his past gradually the reason for his silence wa hidden away entombed somewhere deep in the soothing fold of the fact of it when khubchand his beloved blind bald incontinent seventeen year old mongrel decided to stage a miserable long drawn out death estha nursed him through his final ordeal a though his own life somehow depended on it in the last month of his life khubchand who had the best of intention but the most unreliable of bladder would drag himself to the top hinged dog flap built into the bottom of the door that led out into the back garden push his head through it and urinate unsteadily bright yellowly inside then with bladder empty and conscience clear he would look up at estha with opaque green eye that stood in his grizzled skull like scummy pool and weave his way back to his damp cushion leaving wet footprint on the floor a kdiubchand lay dying on his cushion estha could see the bedroom window reflected in his smooth purple ball and the sky beyond and once a bird that flew across to estha steeped in the smell of old rose blooded on memory of a broken man the fact that something so fragile so unbearably tender had survived had been allowed to exist wa a miracle a bird in flight reflected in an old dog s ball it made him smile out loud after khubchand died estha started his walking he walked for hour on end initially he patrolled only the neighbourhood but gradually went further and further afield people got used to seeing him on the road a well dressed paradise pickle preserve man with a quiet walk his face grew dark and outdoorsy rugged wrinkled by the sun he began to look wiser than he really wa like a fisherman in a city with sea secret in him now that he d been re re turned estha walked all over aye menem some day he walked along the bank of the river that smelled of shit and pesticide bought with world bank loan most of the fish had died the one that survived suffered from fin rot and had broken out ip boil other day he walked down the road past the new freshly baked iced gulf money house built by nurse mason wire bender and bank clerk who worked fiard and unhappily in faraway place past the resentful older house tinged green with envy cowering in their private driveway among their private rubber tree each a tottering fiefdom with an epic of it own he walked past the village school that his great grandfather built for untouchable child past sophie mol s yellow church past the ayemenem youth kung fu club past the tender bud nursery school for touchables past the ration shop that sold rice sugar and banana that hung in yellow bunch from the roof cheap soft pom magazine about fictitious south indian sex fiend were clipped with clothes peg to rope that hung from the ceiling they spun lazily in the warm breeze tempting honest ration buyer with glimpse of ripe naked woman lying in pool of fake blood sometimes estha walked past lucky press old comrade k n m pillai s printing press once the ayemenem office of the communist party where midnight study meeting were held and pamphlet with rousing lyric of marxist party song were printed and distributed the flag that fluttered on the roof had grown limp and old the red had bled away comrade pillai himself came out in the morning in a greying the god of small thing aertex vest his ball silhouetted against his soft white mundu he oiled himself with warm peppered coconut oil kneading his old loose flesh that stretched willingly off his bone like chewing gum he lived alone now his wife kalyani had died of ovarian cancer his son lenin had moved to delhi where he worked a a service contractor for foreign embassy if comrade pillai wa outside his house oiling himself when estha walked past he made it a point to greet him estha monp he would call out in his high piping voice frayed and fibrous now like sugarcane stripped of it bark good morning your daily constitutional estha would walk past not rude not polite just quiet comrade pillai would slap himself all over to get his circu lation going he couldn t tell whether estha recognized him after all those year or not not that he particularly cared though his part in the whole thing had by no mean been a small one comrade pillai didn t hold himself in any way person ally responsible for what had happened he dismissed the whole business a the inevitable consequence of necessary politics the old omelette and egg thing but then comrade k n m pillai wa essentially a political man a professional omeletteer he walked through the world like a chameleon never revealing himself never appearing not to emerging through chaos unscathed he wa the first person in ayem nem to hear of rahel s return the news didn t perturb him a much a excite his curiosity estha wa almost a complete stranger to comrade pillai his expulsion from ayemenem had been so sudden and unceremonious and so very long ago but rahel comrade pillai knew well he had watched her grow up he wondered what had brought her back after all these year it had been quiet in estha s head until rahel came but with her she had brought the sound of passing train and the light paradise pickle preserve and shade that fall on you if you have a window seat the world locked out for year suddenly flooded in and now estha couldn t hear himself for the noise train traffic music the stock market a dam had burst and savage water swept every thing up in a swirling comet violin parade loneliness cloud beard bigot list flag earthquake despair were all swept up in a scrambled swirling and estha walking on the riverbank couldn t feel the wetness of the rain or the suddenshudder of the cold puppy that had temporarily adopted him and squelched at his side he walked past the old mangosteen tree and up to the edge of a laterite spur that jutted out into the river he squatted on his haunch and rocked himself in the rain the wet mud under his shoe made rude sucking sound the cold puppy shivered and watched baby kochamma and kochu maria the vinegar hearted short tempered midget cook were the only people left in the aye menem house when estha wa re returned mammachi their grandmother wa dead chacko lived in canada now and ran an unsuccessful antique business a for rahel after ammu died after the last time she came back to aye menem swollen vith cortisone and a rattle in her chest that sounded like a faraway man shouting rahel drifted from school to school she spent her holiday in ayemenem largely ignored by chacko and mammachi grown soft with sorrow slumped in their bereavement like a pair of drunk in a toddy bar and largely ignoring baby kochamma in matter related to the raising of rahel chacko and mammachi tried but couldn t they provided the care food clothes fee but withdrew the concern the loss of sophie mol stepped softly around the ayemenem house like a quiet thing in sock it hid in book and food in thb god of small thing mammachi s violin case in the scab of the sore on ghacko s shin that he constantly worried in his slack womanish leg it is curious how sometimes the memory of death life on for so much longer than the memory of the life that it purloined over the year a the memory of sophie mol the seeker of small wisdom where do old bird go to die why dordt dead one fall like stone from the sf the harbinger of harsh reality tou re both whole wog and pm a half one the guru of gore pve seen a man in an accident with his eball swinging on the end of a nerve like a yo yo slowly faded the loss of sophie mol grew robust and alive it wa always there like a fruit in season every season a perma nent a a government job it ushered rahel through childhood from school to school into womanhood rahel wa first blacklisted in nazareth convent at the age of eleven when she wa caught outside her housemis tress s garden gate decorating a knob of fresh cowdung with small flower at assembly the next morning she wa made to look up depravity in the oxford dictionary and read aloud it meaning the quality or condition of being depraved or cormpt rahel read with a row of stern mouthed nun seated behind her and a sea of sniggering schoolgirl face in front perverted quality moral perver sion the innate corruption of human nature due to original sin both the elect and the non elect come into the world in a state of total d and alienation from god and can of themselves do nothing but sin j h blunc six month later she wa expelled after repeated complaint from senior girl she wa accused quite rightly of hiding behind door and deliberately colliding with her senior when she wa questioned by the principal about her behaviour cajoled caned starved she eventually admitted that she had done it to find out whether breast hurt in that christian insti tution breast were not acknowledged they weren t supposed to exist and if they didn t could they hurt that wa the first of three expulsion the second for i paradise pickle preserve smoking the third for setting fire to her housemistress s false hair bun which under duress rahel confessed to having stolen in each of the school she went to the teacher noted that she a wa an extremely polite child b had no friend it appeared to be a civil solitary form of corruption and for this very reason they all agreed savouring their teacherly disapproval touching it with their tongue sucking it like a sweet all the more serious it wa they whispered to each other a though she didnh know how to be a girl they weren t far off the mark oddly neglect seemed to have resulted in an accidental release of the spirit rahel grew up without a brief without anybody to arrange a marriage for her without anybody who would pay her a dowry and therefore without an obligatory husband looming on her horizon so a long a she wasn t noisy about it she remained free to make her own enquiry into breast and how much they hurt into false hair bun and how well they burned into life and how it ought to be lived when she finished school she won admission into a mediocre college of architecture in delhi it wasn t the outcome of any serious interest in architecture nor even in fact of a superficial one she just happened to take the entrance exam and hap pened to get through the staff were impressed by the size enormous rather than the skill of her charcoal still life sketch the careless reckless line were mistaken for artistic confidence though in truth their creator wa no artist she spent eight year in college without finishing the five year undergraduate course and taking her degree the fee were low the god of small thing and it wasn t hard to scratch out a living staying in the hostel eating in the subsidized student mess rarely going to class working instead a a draughtsman in gloomy architectural firm that exploited cheap student labour to render their presentation drawing and to blame when thing went wrong the other student particularly the boy were intimidated by rahel s way wardness and almost fierce lack of ambition they left her alone she wa never invited to their nice home or noisy party even her professor were a little wary of her her bizarre impractical building plan presented on cheap brown paper her indiffer ence to their passionate critique she occasionally wrote to ghacko and mammachi but never returned to ayemenem not when mammachi died not when ghacko emigrated to canada it wa while she wa at the school of architecture that she met larry mccaslin who wa in delhi collecting material for his doctoral thesis on energy efficiency in vernacular architecture he first noticed rahel in the school library and then again a few day later in khan market she wa in jean and a white t shirt part of an old patchwork bedspread wa buttoned around her neck and trailed behind her like a cape her wild hair wa tied back to look straight though it wasn t a tiny diamond gleamed in one nostril she had absurdly beautiful collarbone and a nice athletic run there go a jazz tuncy larry mccaslin thought to himself and followed her into a bookshop where neither of them looked at book rahel drifted into marriage like a passenger drift towards an unoccupied chair in an airport lounge with a sitting down sense she returned with him to boston when larry held his wife in his arm her cheek against his heart he wa tall enough to see the top of her head the dark tumble of her hair when he put his finger near the corner of her mouth he could feel a tiny pulse he loved it location and i paradise pickle preserve that faint uncertain jumping just under her skin he would touch it listening with his eye like an expectant father feeling his unborn baby kick inside it mother s womb he held her a though she wa a gift given to him in love something still and small unbearably precious but when they made love he wa offended by her eye they behaved a though they belonged to someone else someone watching looking out of the window at the sea at a boat in the river or a passer by in the mist in a hat he wa exasperated because he didn t know w hat that look meant he put it somewhere between indifference and despair he didn t know that in some place like the country that rahel came from various kind of despair competed for primacy and that personal despair could never be desperate enough that something happened when personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside shrine of the vast violent circling driving ridiculous insane unfeasible public turmoil of a nation that big god howled like a hot wind and demanded obeisance then small god cosy and contained private and limited came away cau terized laughing numbly at his own temerity inured by the confirmation of his own inconsequence he became resilient and truly indifferent nothing mattered much nothing much mattered and the less it mattered the less it mattered it wa never important enough because worse thing had happened in the country that she came from poised forever between the terror of war and the horror of peace worse thing kept happening so small god laughed a hollow laugh and skipped away cheerfully like a rich boy in short he whistled kicked stone the source of his brittle elation wa the relative smallness of his misfortune he climbed into people s eye and became an exasperating expression what larry mccaslin saw in rahel s eye wa not despair at all but a sort of enforced optimism and a hollow where the god of small thing estha s word had been he couldn t be expected to understand that that the emptiness in one twin wa only a version of the quietness in the other that the two thing fitted together like stacked spoon like familiar lover body after they were divorced rahel worked for a few month a a waitress in an indian restaurant in new york and then for several year a a night clerk in a bullet proof cabin at a gas station outside washington where drunk occasionally vomited into the money tray and pimp propositioned her with more lucrative job offer twice she saw men being shot through their car window and once a man who had been stabbed ejected from a moving car with a knife in his back then baby kochamma wrote to say that estha had been re returned rahel gave up her job at the gas station and left america gladly to return to ayemenem to estha in the rain in the old house on the hill baby kochamma sat at the dining table rubbing the thick frothy bitterness out of an elderly cucumber she wa wearing a limp checked seersucker night gown with puffed sleeve and yeuow turmeric stain under the table she swung her tiny manicured foot like a small child on a high chair they were puffy with oedema like litde foot shaped air cushion in the old day whenever anybody visited ayemenem baby kochamma made it a point to call attention to their large foot she would ask to try on their slipper and say took how big for me they are then she would walk around the house in them lifting her sari a little so that every body could marvel at her tiny foot she worked on the cucumber with an air of barely concealed triumph she wa delighted that estha had not spoken to rahel that he had looked at her and walked straight past into the rain a he did with everyone else she wa eighty three her eye spread like butter behind her thick glass paradise pickle preserve i told you didn t i she said to rahel what did you expect special treatment he s lost his mind pm telling you he doesn t recognize people any more what did you think rahel said nothing she could feel the rhythm of estha s rocking and the wetness of rain on his skin she could hear the raucous scrambled world inside his head baby kochamma looked up at rahel uneasily already she regretted having written to her about estha s return but then what else could she have done had him on her hand for the rest of her life why should she he wasn t her responsibility or wa he the silence sat between grand niece and baby grand aunt like a third person a stranger swollen noxious baby kochamma reminded herself to lock her bedroom door at night she tried to think of something to say how d you like my bob with her cucumber hand she touched her new haircut she left a riveting bitter blob of cucumber froth behind rahel could think of nothing to say she watched baby kochamma peel her cucumber yellow sliver of cucumber skin flecked her bosom her hair dyed jetblack wa arranged across her scalp like unspooled thread the dye had stained the skin of her forehead a pale grey giving her a shadowy second hairline rahel noticed that she had started wearing make up lipstick kohl a sly touch of rouge and because the house wa locked and dark and because she only believed in watt bulb her lipstick mouth had shifted slightly off her real mouth she had lost weight on her face and shoulder which had turned her from being a round person into a conical person but sitting at the dining table with her enormous hip concealed she managed to look almost fragile the dim dining room light had rubbed the wrinkle off her face leaving it looking in a the god of small thing strange sunken way younger she wa wearing a lot of jewel lery rahei s dead grandmother s jewellery all of it winking ring diamond earring gold bangle and a beautifully crafted flat gold chain that she touched from time to time reassuring herself that it wa there and that it wa hers like a young bride who couldn t believe her good fortune she s living her life backwards rahel thought it wa a curiously apt observation baby kochamma had lived her life backwards a a young woman she had renounced the material world and now a an old one she seemed to embrace it she hugged it and it hugged her back when she wa eighteen baby kochamma fell in love with a handsome young irish monk father mulligan who wa in ker ala for a year on deputation from his seminary in madras he wa studying hindu scripture in order to be able to denounce them intelligently every thursday morning father mulligan came to aye menem to visit baby kochamma s father reverend e john ipe who wa a priest of the mar thoma church reverend ipe wa well known in the christian community a the man who had been blessed personally by the patriarch of antioch the sovereign head of the syrian christian church an episode which had become part of ayemenem s folklore in when baby kochamma s father wa seven year old his father had taken him to see the patriarch who wa visiting the syrian christian of kerala they found themselves right in front of a group of people whom the patriarch wa addressing in the westernmost verandah of the kalleny house in cochin seizing his opportunity his father whispered in his young son s ear and propelled the iitde feuow forward the future reverend skidding on his heel rigid with fear applied his terrified lip to the ring on the patriarch s middle finger leaving it wet with spit the patriarch wiped his ring on his sleeve and blessed the little boy long after he grew up and became a priest reverend paradise pickle preserve ipe continued to be known a punnyan kunju little blessed one and people came down the river in boat all the way from alleppey and ernakulam with child to be blessed by him though there wa a considerable age difference between father mulligan and reverend ipe and though they belonged to different denomination of the church whose only common sentiment wa their mutual disaffection both men enjoyed each other s company and more often than not father mulligan would be invited to stay for lunch of the two men only one recognized the sexual excitement that rose like a tide in the slender girl who hovered around the table long after lunch had been cleared away at first baby kochamma tried to seduce father mulligan with weekly exhibition of staged charity every thursday morn ing just when father mulligan wa due to arrive baby koch amma force bathed a poor village child at the well with hard red soap that hurt it protruding rib morning father baby kochamma would call out when she saw him with a smile on her lip that completely belied the vice like grip that she had on the thin child s soapslippery arm morning to you baby father mulligan would say stopping and folding his umbrella there s something i wanted to ask you father baby koch amma would say in first corinthian chapter ten verse twenty three it say all thing are lawful for me but all thing are not expedient father how can all thing be lawful unto him i mean i can understand if some thing are lawful for him but father mulligan wa more than merely flattered by the emo tion he aroused in the attractive young girl who stood before him with a trembling kissable mouth and blazing coal black eye for he wa young too and perhaps not wholly unaware that the solemn explanation with which he dispelled her bogus the god of small thing biblical doubt were completely at odds wdth the thrilling promise he held out in his effulgent emerald eye every thursday undaunted by the merciless midday sun they would stand there by the well the young girl and the intrepid jesuit both quaking with unchristian passion using the bible a a ruse to be with each other invariably in the middle of their conversation the unfortu nate soapy child that wa being force bathed would manage to slip away and father mulligan would snap back to his sens and say oops we d better catch him before a cold doe then he would reopen his umbrella and walk away in choco late robe and comfortable sandal like a high stepping camel with an appointment to keep he had young baby kochamma s aching heart on a leash bumping behind him lurching over leaf and small stone bruised and almost broken a whole year of thursday went by eventually the time came for father mulligan to return to madras since charity had not produced any tangible result the distraught young baby kochamma invested all her hope in faith displaying a stubborn single mindedness which in a young girl in those day wa considered a bad a a physical deformity a harelip perhaps or a club foot baby kochamma defied her father s wish and became a roman catholic with special dispensation from the vatican she took her vow and entered a convent in madras a a trainee novice she hoped somehow that this would provide her with legitimate occasion to be with father mulligan she pictured them together in dark sepulchral room with heavy velvet drape discussing theology that wa all she wanted all she ever dared to hope for just to be near him close enough to smell his beard to see the coarse weave of his cassock to love him just by looking at him very quickly she realized the futility of this endeavour she found that the senior sister monopolized the priest and bishop with biblical doubt more sophisticated than hers would paradise pickle preserve ever be and that it might be year before she got any where near father mulligan she grew restless and unhappy in the convent she developed a stubborn allergic rash on her scalp from the constant chafing of her wimple she felt she spoke much better english than everybody else this made her lonelier than ever within a year of her joining the convent her father began to receive puzzling letter from her in the mail my dearest papa i am well and happy in the service of our lady but koh i noor appears to be unhappy and homesick my dearest papa today koh i noor vomited cfter lunch and is running a temperature aly dearest papa convent food doe not seem to suit koh i noor though i like it well enough my dearest papa koh i noor is upset because her family seems to neither understand nor care about her wellbeing other than the fact that it wa at the time the name of the world s biggest diamond reverend e john ipe knew of no other koh i noor he wondered how a girl with a muslim name had ended up in a catholic convent it wa baby kochamma s mother who eventually realized that koh i noor wa none other than baby kochamma herself she remembered that long ago she had shown baby kochamma a copy of her father s baby kochamma s grandfather s will in which describing his grandchild he had written i have seven jewel one of which is my koh i noor he went on to bequeath little bit of money and jewellery to each of them never clarifying which one he considered his koh i noor baby kochamma s mother realized that baby kochamma for no reason that she could think of had assumed that he had meant her and all those year later at the convent knowing that all her letter were read by the mother superior before they were posted had resurrected koh i noor to communicate her trouble to her family reverend ipe went to madras and withdrew his daughter from the convent she wa glad to leave but insisted that she the god of small thing would not reconvert and for the rest of her day remained a roman catholic reverend ipe realized that his daughter had by now de eloped a reputation and wa unlikely to find a husband he decided that since she couldn t have a husband there wa no harm in her having an education so he made arrangement for her to attend a course of study at the univer sity of rochester in america two year later baby kochamma returned from rochester with a diploma in ornamental gardening but more in love with father mulligan than ever there wa no trace of the slim attractive girl that she had been in her year at rochester baby kochamma had grown extremely large in fact let it be said obese even timid little ghellappen tailor at ghungam bridge insisted on charging bush shirt rate for her sari blouse to keep her from brooding her father gave baby kochamma charge of the front garden of the ayemenem house where she raised a fierce bitter garden that people came all the way from kottayam to see it wa a circular sloping patch of ground with a steep gravel driveway looping around it baby kochamma turned it into a lush maze of dwarf hedge rock and gargoyle the flower she loved the most wa the anthurium anthurium andraeanum she had a collection of them the rubrum the honeymoon and a host of japanese variety their single succulent spathe ranged from shade of mottled black to blood red and glistening orange their prominent stippled spadix alw ays yellow in the centre of baby kochamma s garden surrounded by bed of canna and phlox a marble cherub peed an endless silver arc into a shallow pool in which a single blue lotus bloomed at each corner of the pool lolled a pink plaster of paris gnome with rosy cheek and a peaked red cap baby kochamma spent her afternoon in her garden in sari and gumboots she wielded an enormous pair of hedge shear in her bright orange gardening glove like a lion tamer she paradise pickle preserve tamed twisting vine and nurtured bristling cactus she limited bonsai plant and pampered rare orchid she waged war on the weather she tried to grow edelweiss and chinese guava every night she creamed her foot with real cream and pushed back the cuticle on her toe nail recently after enduring more than half a centur of relent less pernickety attention the ornamental garden had been abandoned left to it own device it had grown knotted and wild like a circus whose animal had forgotten their trick the weed that people call communist patcha because it flourished in kerala like communism smothered the more exotic plant only the vine kept growing like toe nail on a corpse they reached through the nostril of the pink plaster gnome and blossomed in their hollow head giving them an expression half surprised half sneeze coming the reason for this sudden unceremonious dumping wa a new love baby kochamma had installed a dish antenna on the roof of the ayemenem house she presided over the world in her drawing room on satellite tv the impossible excitement that this engendered in baby kochamma wasn t hard to under stand it wasn t something that happened gradually it happened overnight blonde war famine football sex music coup d etat they all arrived on the same train they unpacked together they stayed at the same hotel and in ayemenem where once the loudest sound had been a musical bus horn now whole war famine picturesque massacre and bill clin ton could be summoned up like serv ant and so while her ornamental garden wilted and died baby kochamma followed american nba league game one day cricket and all the grand slam tennis tournament on weekday she watched hie bold and the beautiful and santa barbara where brittle blonde with lipstick and hairstyle rigid with spray seduced android and defended their sexual empire baby kochamma loved their shiny clothes and the smart bitchy repartee during the day the god of small thing disconnected snatch of it came back to her and made her chuckle kochu maria the cook still wore the thick gold earring that had disfigured her earlobe for ever she enjoyed the wwf wrestling mania show where hulk hogan and mr perfect whose neck were wider than their head wore spangled lycra legging and beat each other up brutally kochu maria s laugh had that slightly cruel ring to it that young child s sometimes have all day they sat in the drawing room baby kochamma on the long armed planter s chair or the chaise longue depending on the condition of her foot kochu maria next to her on the floor channel surfing when she could locked together in a noisy television silence one s hair snow white the other s dyed coal black they entered all the contest availed themselves of all the discount that were advertised and had on two occasion won a t shirt and a thermos flask that baby kochamma kept locked away in her cupboard baby kochamma loved the ayemenem house and cherished the furniture that she had inherited by outliving everybody else mammachi s violin and violin stand the ooty cupboard the plastic basket chair the delhi bed the dressing table from vienna with cracked ivory knob the rosewood dining table that velutha made she wa frightened by the bbc famine and television war that she encountered while she channel surfed her old fear of the revolution and the marxist leninist menace had been rekindled by new television worry about the growing number of desperate and dispossessed people she viewed ethnic clean ing famine and genocide a direct threat to her furniture she kept her door and window locked unless she wa using them she used her window for specific purpose for a breath of fresh air to pay for the milk to let out a trapped wasp which kochu maria wa made to chase around the house with a towel paradise pickle preserve she even locked her sad paint flaking fridge where she kept her week s supply of cream bun that kochu maria brought her from bestbakeiy in kottayam and the two bottle of rice water that she drank instead of ordinary water in the shelf below the baffle tray she kept what wa left of mammachi s willow pattern dinner seivice she put the dozen or so bottle of insulin that rahel brought her in the cheese and butter compartment she suspected that these day even the innocent and the round eyed could be crockery crook or cream bun cravers or thieving diabetic cruising ayemenem for imported insulin she didn t even trust the twin she deemed them capable of anything anything at all they might even steal their present back she thought and realized with a pang how quickly she had reverted to thinking of them a though they were a single unit once again after all those year determined not to let the past creep up on her she altered her thought at once she she might steal her present back she looked at rahel standing at the dining table and noticed the same eerie stealth the ability to keep very still and very quiet that estha seemed to have mastered baby kochamma wa a little intimidated by rahel s quietness sol she said her voice shrill faltering what are your plan how long will you be staying have you decided rahel tried to say something it came out jagged like a piece of tin she walked to the window and opened it for a breath of fresh air shut it when you ve finished with it baby kochamma said and closed her face like a cupboard you couldn t see the river from the window any more you could until mammachi had had the back verandah closed in with ayemenem s first sliding folding door the oil the god of s m a l e thing portrait ofreverend e john ipe and aleyooty ammachi eslha and rahees great grandparent were taken down from the back verandah and put up in the front one they hung there now the eittle blessed one and his wife on either side of the stuffed mounted bison head reverend ipe smiled his confident ancestor smile out across the road instead of the river aleyooty ammachi looked more hesitant a though she would have liked to turn around but couldn t perhaps it wasn t a easy for her to abandon the river with her eye she looked in the direction that her husband looked with her heart she looked away her heavy dull gold kunukku earring token of the little blessed one s goodness had stretched her earlobe and hung all the way down to her shoulder through the hole in her ear you could see the hot river and the dark tree that bent into it and the fisherman in their boat and the fish though you couldn t see the river from the house any more like a seashell always ha a sea sense the ayemenem house still had a river sense a rushing rolling fishswimming sense from the dining room window where she stood with the wind in her hair rahel could see the rain drum down on the rusted tin roof of what used to be their grandmother s pickle factory paradise pickle preserve it lay between the house and the river they used to make pickle squash jam curry powder and canned pineapple and banana jam illegally after the fpo food product organization banned it because accord ing to their specification it wa neither jam nor jelly too thin for jelly and too thick for jam an ambiguous unclassifiable consistency they said a per their book looking back now to rahel it seemed a though this difficulty paradise p i c k e e s p r e s e r e s that their family had with classification ran much deeper than the jam jclly question perhaps ammu estha and she were the w orst transgi essors but it w asn t just them it wa the others too they all broke the rule t hey ail crossed into forbidden territory they ail tampered with the law that lay down w ho should be lo ed and how and how much the law that make gi andmothers grandmother uncle uncle mother mother cousin cousin jam jam and jelly jelly it wa a time when uncle became father mother lover and cousin died and had funeral it wa a time when the unthinkable became thinkable and the impossible really happened even before sophie mol s funeral the police found velutha his arm had goosebump where the handcuff touched his skin cold handcuff with a sourmetal smell like steel bus rail and the smell of the bus conductor s hand from holding them after it wa all over baby kochamma said a ye sow so shall ye reap a though she had had nothing to do with the sowing and the reaping she returned on her small foot to her cross stitch embroidery her little toe never touched the floor it wa her idea that estha be returned margaret kochamma s grief and bitterness at her daughter s death coiled inside her like an angiy spring she said nothing but slapped estha whenever she could in the day she wa there before she returned to england rahel watched ammu pack estha s little trunk maybe they re right ammu s whisper said maybe a boy doe need a baba rahel saw that her eye w ere a redly dead they consulted a twin expert in hyderabad she w rote back to say that it wa not advisable to separate monozygotic twin the god of small thing but that two egg twin were no different from ordinary sibling and that while they would certainly suffer the natural distress that child from broken home underwent it would be nothing more than that nothing out of the ordinary and so estha wa returned in a train with his tin trunk and his beige and pointy shoe rolled into his khaki holdall first class overnight on the madras mail to madras and then with a friend of their father s from madras to calcutta he had a tiffin carrier with tomato sandwich and an eagle flask with an eagle he had terrible picture in his head rain rushing inky water and a smell sicksweet like old rose on a breeze but worst of all he carried inside him the memory of a young man with an old man s mouth the memory of a swollen face and a smashed upside down smile of a spreading pool of clear liquid with a bare bulb reflected in it of a bloodshot eye that had opened wandered and then fixed it gaze on him estha and what had estha done he had looked into that beloved face and said yes te it wa him the word estha s octopus couldn t get at te hoovering didn t seem to help it wa lodged there deep inside some fold or furrow like a mango hair between molar that couldn t be worried loose in a purely practical sense it would probably be correct to say that it all began when sophie mol came to ayemenem perhaps it s true that thing can change in a day that a few dozen hour can affect the outcome of whole lifetime and that when they do those few dozen hour like the salvaged remains of a burned house the charred clock the singed photograph the scorched furniture must be resurrected from the ruin and examined preserved accounted for little event ordinary thing smashed and reconstituted paradise pickle preserve imbued with new meaning suddenly they become the bleached bone of a story still to say that it all began when sophie mol came to aye menem is only one way of looking at it equally it could be argued that it actually began thousand of year ago long before the marxist came before the british took malabar before the dutch ascendency before vasco da gama arrived before the zamorin s conquest of calicut before three purple robed syrian bishop murdered by the portuguese were found floating in the sea with coiled sea serpent riding on their chest and oyster knotted in their tangled beard it could be argued that it began long before christianity arrived in a boat and seeped into kerala like tea from a teabag that it really began in the day when the love law were made the law that lay down who should be loved and how and how much however for practical purpose in a hopelessly practical world pappachi s moth it wa a skybiue day in december sixty nine the nineteen silent it wa the kind of time in the life of a family when something happens to nudge it hidden morality from it resting place and make it bubble to the surface and float for a while in clear view for everyone to see a skybiue plymouth with the sun in it tailfin sped past young rice field and old rubber tree on it way to cochin further east in a small counti y with similar landscape jungle river rice field communist enough bomb were being dropped to cover all of it in six inch of steel here however it wa peacetime and the family in the plymouth travelled with out fear or foreboding the plymouth used to belong to pappachi rahel and estha s grandfather now that he wa dead it belonged to mammachi their grandmother and rahel and estha were on their way to cochin to see uie sound of alusic for the third time they knew all the song after that they were all going to stay at hotel sea queen with the oldfood smell booking had been made early next morning they would go to cochin airport to pick up chacko s ex wife their english aunt margaret kochamma and their cousin sophie mol who were coming from london to spend christmas at ayemenem earlier that year margaret koch amma s second husband joe had been killed in a car accident the god of small thing when chacko heard about the accident he invited them to ayemenem he said that he couldn t bear to think of them spending a lonely desolate christmas in england in a house full of memory ammu said that chacko had never stopped loving margaret kochamma mammachi disagreed she liked to believe that he had never loved her in the first place rahel and estha had never met sophie mol they d heard a lot about her though that last week from baby kochamma from kochu maria and even mammachi none of them had met her either but they all behaved a though they already knew her it had been the what will sophie mol think week that whole week baby kochamma eavesdropped relentlessly on the twin private conversation and whenever she caught them speaking in malayalam she levied a small fine which wa deducted at source from their pocket money she made them write line imposition she called them i will always speak in english i will always speak in english a hundred time each when they were done she scored them out with her red pen to make sure that old line were not recycled for new punishment she had made them practise an english car song for the way back they had to form the word properly and be particularly careful about their pronunciation prer nu n sea ayshun r oice in the lo ord or orlways and again i say r oice r oice r oice and again i say rg oice estha s full name wa esthappen yako rahel s wa rahel for the time being they had no surname because ammu wa considering reverting to her maiden name though she said that p a p p a g h i s moth choosing between her husband s name and her father s name didn t give a woman much of a choice estha wa wearing his beige and pointy shoe and his elvis puff his special outing puff his favourite eh is song w a party sorne people like to rock some people like to roll he would croon when nobody wa watching strumming a badminton racquet curling his lip like elvis but moonin an a groonin gon na satis mail soul less have a pardy estha had slanting sleepy eye and his new front teeth w ere still uneven on the end rahel s new teeth were waiting inside her gum like word in a pen it puzzled eveiy body that an eighteen minute age difference could cause such a discrepancy in front tooth timing most of rahel s hair sat on top of her head like a fountain it wa held together by a love in tokyo two bead on a rubber band nothing to do with love or tokyo in kerala love in tokyo have withstood the test of time and even today if you were to ask for one at any respectable a i lady store that s what you d get two bead on a rubber band rahel s toy wristwatch had the time painted on it ten to two one of her ambition wa to own a watch on which she could change the time whenever she wanted to which according to her wa what time wa meant for in the first place her yellow rimmed red plastic sunglass made the world look red ammu said that they were bad for her eye and had ad ased her to wear them a seldom a possible her airport frock wa in ammu s suitcase it had special matching knickers chacko wa drixing he wa four year older than ammu rahel and estha couldn t call him ghachen because wlen they did he called them chetan and cheduthi if they called him ammaven he called them appoi and ammai if they called him uncle he called them aunty which wa embarrassing in public so they called him chacko the god of small thing chacko s room wa stacked from floor to ceiling with book he had read them all and quoted long passage from them for no apparent reason or at least none that anyone else could fathom for instance that morning a they drove out through the gate shouting their goodbye to mammachi in the verandah chacko suddenly said gatsby turned out all right at the end it is what preyed on gatsby what foul dust floated in the wake of his dream that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrow and short winded elation of men everyone wa so used to it that they didn t bother to nudge each other or exchange glance chacko had been a rhodes scholar at oxford and wa permitted excess and eccentricity nobody else wa he claimed to be writing a family biography that the family would have to pay him not to publish ammu said that there wa only one person in the family who wa a fit candidate for biographical blackmail and that wa chacko himself of course that wa then before the terror in the plymouth ammu wa sitting in front next to chacko she wa twenty seven that year and in the pit of her stomach she carried the cold knowledge that for her life had been lived she had had one chance she made a mistake she married the wrong man ammu finished her schooling the same year that her father retired from his job in delhi and moved to ayemenem pappa chi insisted that a college education wa an unnecessary expense for a girl so ammu had no choice but to leave delhi and move with them there wa very little for a young girl to do in ayemenem other than to wait for marriage proposal while she helped her mother with the housework since her father did not have enough money to raise a suitable dowry no proposal came ammu s way two year went by her eighteenth birthday came and went unnoticed or at least unremarked upon by her parent ammu grew desperate all day she dreamed of pappachl s moth escaping from ayemenem and the clutch oi her ill tcmp ered father and bitter long suffering mother she hatched se eral wretched little plan eventually one worked pappachi agreed to let her spend the summer with a distant aunt who lived in calcutta there at someone else s wedding reception ammu met her future husband he wa on vacation from his job in assam where he worked a an assistant manager of a tea estate his family were once wealthy zamindars who had migrated to calcutta from east bengal after partition he wa a small man but well built pleasant looking he wore old fashioned spectacle that made him look earnest and completely belied his easy going charm and juvenile but totally disarming sense of humour he wa twenty five and had already been working on the tea estate for six year he hadn t been to college which accounted for his schoolboy humour he pro posed to ammu five day after they first met ammu didn t pretend to be in love with him she just weighed the odds and accepted she thought that arvytki g anyone at all would be better than returning to ayemenem she wrote to her parent informing them of her decision they didn t reply ammu had an elaborate calcutta wedding later looking back on the day ammu realized that the slighdy feverish glitter in her bridegroom s eye had not been love or even excitement at the prospect of carnal bliss but approximately eight large peg of whisky straight neat ammu s father in law wa chairman of the railway board and had a boxing blue from cambridge he wa the secretary of the baba the bengal amateur boxing association he gave the young couple a custom painted powder pink fiat a a present which after the wedding he drove off in himself with all the jewellery and most of the other present that they had been given he died before the twin were born on the the god of small thing operating table while his gall bladder wa being removed his cremation wa attended by all the boxer in bengal a congregation of mourner with lantern jaw and broken nose when ammu and her husband moved to assam ammu beautiful young and cheeky became the toast of the planter club she wore backless blouse with her sari and carried a silver lame purse on a chain she smoked long cigarette in a silver cigarette holder and learned to blow perfect smoke ring her husband turned out to be not just a heavy drinker but a full blown alcoholic with all of an alcoholic s deviousness and tragic charm there were thing about him that ammu never understood long after she left him she never stopped wonder ing why he lied so outrageously when he didn t need to particu larly when he didn t need to in a conversation with friend he would talk about how much he loved smoked salmon when ammu knew he hated it or he would come home from the club and tell ammu that he saw meet me in st louis when they d actually screened the bronze buckaroo when she confronted him about these thing he never explained or apologized he just giggled exasperating ammu to a degree she never thought herself capable of ammu wa eight month pregnant when war broke out with china it wa october of planter wife and child were evacuated from assam ammu too pregnant to travel remained on the estate in november after a hair raising bumpy bus ride to shillong amidst rumour of chinese occupa tion and india s impending defeat estha and rahel were born by candlelight in a hospital with the window blacked out they emerged without much fuss within eighteen minute of each other two little one instead of one big one twin seal slick with their mother s juice wrinkled with the effort of being born ammu checked them for deformity before she closed her eye and slept pappaghi s moth she counted four eye four ear two mouth two nose twenty finger and twenty perfect toe nail she didn t notice the single siamese soul she wa glad to have them their father stretched out on a hard bench in the hospital corridor wa drunk by the time the twin were two year old their father s drink ing aggravated by the loneliness of tea estate life had driven him into an alcoholic stupor whole day went by during which he just lay in bed and didn t go to work eventually his english manager mr hollick summoned him to his bungalow for a serious chat ammu sat in the verandah of her home waiting anxiously for her husband to return she wa sure the only reason that hollick wanted to see him wa to sack him she wa surprised when he returned looking despondent but not devastated mr hollick had proposed something he told ammu that he needed to discus with her he began a little diffidendy avoiding her gaze but he gathered courage a he went along viewed practi cally in the long run it wa a proposition that would benefit both of them he said in fact all of them if they considered the child s education mr hollick had been frank with his young assistant he informed him of the complaint he had received from the labour a well a from the other assistant manager i m afraid i have no option he said but to ask for your resignation he allowed the silence to take it toll he allowed the pitiful man sitting across the table to begin to shake to weep then hollick spoke again well actually there mxiy be an option perhaps we could work something out think positive is what i always say count your blessing hollick paused to order a pot of black coffee you re a very lucky man you know wonderful family beautiful child such an attractive wife he lit a cigarette and the god of small rhings allowed the match to burn until he couldn t hold it any more an extremely attractive wife the weeping stopped puzzled brown eye looked into lurid red veined green one over coffee mr hollick proposed that baba go aw ay for a while for a holiday to a clinic perhaps for treatment for a long a it took him to get better and for the period of time that he wa away mr hollick suggested that ammu be sent to his bungalow to be looked after already there w ere a number of ragged lightskinned child on the estate that hollick had bequeathed on tea picker whom he fancied this w a his first incursion into management circle ammu watched her husband s mouth move a it formed word she said nothing he grew uncomfortable and then infuriated by her silence suddenly he lunged at her grabbed her hair punched her and then passed out from the effort ammu took down the heaviest book she could find in the book shelf the reader s digest world allas and hit him wdth it a hard a she could on his head his leg his back and shoulder when he regained consciousness he wa puzzled by his bmises he apologized abjectly for the violence but immediately began to badger her about helping with his transfer this fell into a pattern drunken violence followed by post drunken badgering ammu wa repelled by the medicinal smell of stale alcohol that seeped through his skin and the dry caked vomit that encrusted his mouth like a pie every morning when his bout of violence began to include the child and the war with pakistan began ammu left her husband and returned unwclcomed to her parent in ayemenem to everything that she had fled from only a few year ago except that now she had two young child and no more dream pappachi would not believe her story not because he thought well of her husband but simply because he didn t believe that an englishman ary englishman would covet another man s wife pappaghl s moth ammu lo ed her child of course but their wide eyed vulnerability and their willingness to love people wiio didn t really love them exasperated her and sometimes made her want to hurt them just a an education a protection it wa a though the window through which their father disappeared had been kept open for anyone to walk in and be welcomed to ammu her twin seemed like a pair of small bewildered frog engrossed in each other s company lolloping arm in arm down a highway full of hurtling traffic entirely oblivious of what truck can do to frog ammu watched ov er them fiercely her watchfulness stretched her made her taut and tense she wa quick to reprimand her child but e en quicker to take offence on their behalf for herself she knew that there would be no more chance there wa only ayemenem now a front verandah and a back verandah a hot river and a pickle factory and in the background the constant high whining mewl of local disapproval within the first few month of her return to her parent home ammu quickly learned to recognize and despise the ugly face of sympathy old female relation with incipient beard and several wobbling chin made overnight trip to ayemenem to commiserate with her about her divorce they squeezed her knee and gloated she fought off the urge to slap them or twiddle their nipple with a spanner like chaplin in alodem time when she looked at herself in her wedding photograph ammu felt the w oman that looked back at her w a someone else a foolish jew clled bride her silk sunset coloured sari shot with gold ring on every finger white dot of sandalwood paste over her arched eyebrow looking at herself like this ammu s soft mouth w ould twist into a small bitter smile at the memory not of the w edding itself so much a the fact that the god of small thing she had permitted herself to be so painstakingly decorated before being led to the gallows it seemed so absurd so futile like polishing firewood she went to the village goldsmith and had her heavy wedding ring melted down and made into a thin bangle with snakehead that she put away for rahel ammu knew that wedding were not something that could be avoided altogether at least not practically speaking but for the rest of her life she advocated small wedding in ordinary clothes it made them less ghoulish she thought occasionally when ammu listened to song that she loved on the radio something stirred inside her a liquid ache spread under her skin and she walked out of the world like a witch to a better happier place on day like this there wa something restless and untamed about her a though she had temporarily set aside the morality of motherhood and divorceehood even her walk changed from a safe mother walk to another wilder sort of walk she wore flower in her hair and carried magic secret in her eye she spoke to no one she spent hour on the riverbank with her little plastic transistor shaped like a tangerine she smoked cigarette and had midnight swim what wa it that gave ammu this unsafe edge this air of unpredictability it wa what she had battiing inside her an unmixable mix the infinite tenderness of motherhood and the reckless rage of a suicide bomber it wa this that grew inside her and eventually led her to love by night the man her child loved by day to use by night the boat that her child used by day the boat that estha sat on and rahel found on the day that the radio played ammu s song everyone wa a litde wary of her they sensed somehow that she lived in the penumbral shadow between two world just beyond the grasp of their power that a woman that they had already damned now had little left to lose and could therefore be dangerous so on the day that the radio played ammu s song pappaghi s moth people avoided her made litde loop around her because every body agreed that it wa best to just let her be on other day she had deep dimple when she smiled she had a delicate chiselled face black eyebrow angled like a soaring seagull s wing a small straight nose and luminous nutbrown skin on that skyblue december day her wild curly hair had escaped in wisp in the car wind her shoulder in her sleeveless sari blouse shone a though they had been polished with a high wax shoulder polish sometimes she wa the most beautiful woman that estha and rahel had ever seen and sometimes she wasn t on the back seat of the plymouth between estha and rahel sat baby kochamma ex nun and incumbent baby grand aunt in the way that the unfortunate sometimes dislike the co unfortunate baby kochamma disliked the twin for she con sidered them doomed fatherless waif worse still they were half hindu hybrid whom no self respecting syrian christian would ever marry she wa keen for them to realize that they like herself lived on sufferance in the ayemenem house their maternal gi andmother s house where they really had no right to be baby kochamma resented ammu because she saw her quarrelling with a fate that she baby kochamma herself felt she had graciously accepted the fate of the wretched man less woman the sad father mulligan less baby kochamma she had managed to persuade herself over the year that her uncon summated love for father mulligan had been entirely due to her restraint and her determination to do the right thing she subscribed wholeheartedly to the commonly held view that a married daughter had no position in her parent home a for a divorced daughter according to baby kochamma she had no position anywhere at all and a for a divorced daughter from a love marriage well word could not describe baby koch amma s outrage a for a divorced daughter from a iritercornrriuriity the god of s m a i d thing love marriage baby kocliamma chose to remain qiik eringly silent on the subject the twin were too young to understand all this so baby kochamma grudged them their moment of high happiness when a dragonfly they d caught lifted a small stone off their palm with it leg or when they had permission to bathe the pig or they found an egg hot from a hen but most of all she grudged them the comfort they drew from each other she expected from them some token unhappiness at the very least on the way back from the airport margaret kochamma would sit in front with chacko because she used to be his wife sophie mol would sit between them ammu would move to the back there would be two flask of water boiled water for margaret kochamma and sophie mol tap water for everybody else the luggage would be in the boot rahel thought that boot wa a lovely word a much better word at any rate than sturdy sturdy wa a terrible word like a dwarf s name sturdy koshy oommen a pleasant middle class god fearing dwarf with low knee and a side parting on the plymouth roof rack there wa a four sided tin lined plyw ood billboard that said on all four side in elaborate writing paradise pickle preserve below the writing there were painted bottle of mixed fruit jam and hot lime pickle in edible oil with label that said in elaborate writing paradise pickle preserve next to the bottle there wa a list of all the paradise product and a kathakali dancer with his face green and skirt swirling along the bottom of the s shaped swirl of his billowing skirt it said in an s shaped swirl emperor of the realm of paste which wa comrade k n m pillai s unsolicited contribution it wa a literal translation of ruchi lokathinde rajavu which sounded a littie less ludicrous than emperor of the realm of paste but since comrade pillai had already printed them no one had pappachl s moth the heart to ask him to re do the whole print order so unhappily emperor of the realm of taste became a permanent feature on the paradise pickle label ammu said that the kathakali dancer wa a red herring and had nothing to do with an nhing ghacko said that it gave the product a regional flavour and would stand them in good stead when they entered the overseas market ammu said that the billboard made them look ridiculous like a travelling circus with tailfin alammachi had started making pickle commercially soon after pappachi retired from government serv ice in delhi and came to live in ayemenem the kottayam bible society wa having a fair and asked mammachi to make some of her famous banana jam and tender mango pickle it sold quickly and mammachi found that she had more order than she could cope with thrilled with her success she decided to persist with the pickle and jam and soon found herself busy all year round pappachi for his part wa having trouble coping with the ignominy of retirement he wa seventeen year older than mammachi and realized with a shock that he wa an old man when his w ife wa still in her prime though mammachi had conical cornea and wa already practically blind pappachi would not help her with the pickle making because he did not consider pickle making a suitable job for a high ranking ex government official he had always been a jealous man so he greatly resented the attention his wife wa suddenly getting he slouched around the compound in his immaculately tailored suit weaving sullen circle around mound of red chilli and freshly powdered yellow turmeric w atching mammachi supervise the buyang the weighing the salting and drying of lime and tender mango every night he beat her with a brass flower vase the beating weren t new what wa new wa only the frequency with which they took the god of small thing place one night pappachi broke the bow of mammachi s violin and threw it in the rivei then chacko came home for a summer vacation from oxford he had grown to be a big man and wa in those day strong from rowing for balliol a week after he arrived he found pappachi beating mammachi in the study chacko strode into the room caught pappachi s vase hand and twisted it around his back never want this to happen again he told w father ever for the rest of that day pappachi sat in the verandah and stared stonily out at the ornamental garden ignoring the plate of food that kochu maria brought him late at night he went into his study and brought out his favourite mahogany rocking chair he put it down in the middle of the driveway and smashed it into little bit with a plumber s monkey wrench he left it there in the moonlight a heap of varnished wicker and splin tered wood he never touched mammachi again but he never spoke to her either a long a he lived when he needed anything he used kochu maria or ba kochamma a intermediary in the evening when he knew visitor were expected he would sit on the verandah and sew button that weren t missing onto his shirt to create the impression that mammachi neg lected him to some small degree he did succeed in further corroding ayemenem s view of working wife he bought the skyblue plymouth from an old englishman in munnar he became a familiar sight in ayemenem coasting importantly down the narrow road in his wide car looking outwardly elegant but sweating freely inside his woollen suit he wouldn t allow mammachi or anyone else in the family to use it or even to sit in it the plymouth wa pappachi s revenge pappachi had been an imperial entomologist at the pusa institute after independence when the british left his desig nation wa changed from imperial entomologist to joint pappachl s moth director entomolog the year he retired he had risen to a rank equivalent to director his life s greatest setback wa not having had the moth that he had discovered named after him it fell into his drink one evening while he wa sitting in the verandah of a rest house after a long day in the field a he picked it out he noticed it unusually dense dorsal tuft he took a closer look with growing excitement he mounted it measured it and the next morning placed it in the sun for a few hour for the alcohol to evaporate then he caught the first train back to delhi to taxonomic attention and he hoped fame after six unbearable month of anxiety to pappachi s intense disappoint ment he wa told that his moth had finally been identified a a slightly unusual race of a well known specie that belonged to the tropical family lymantriidae the real blow came twelve year later when a a conse quence of a radical taxonomic reshuffle lepidopterist decided that pappachi s moth wa in fact a separate specie and genus hitherto unknown to science by then of course pappachi had retired and moved to ayemenem it wa too late for him to assert his claim to the discoveiy his moth wa named after the acting director of the department of entomology a junior officer whom pappachi had always disliked in the year to come even though he had been ill humoured long before he discovered the moth pappachi s moth wa held responsible for his black mood and sudden bout of temper it pernicious ghost grey furry and with unusually dense dorsal tuft haunted every house that he ever lived in it tormented him and his child and his child s child until the day he died even in the stifling ayemenem heat every single day pappachi wore a w ell pressed three piece suit and his gold pocket watch on his dressing table next to his cologne and silver hairbrush he kept a picture of himself a a young man with his hair slicked down taken in a photographer s studio in vienna the god of small thing where he had done the six month diploma course that had qualified him to apply for the post of imperial entomologist it wa during those few month they spent in vienna that jmamma chi took her first lesson on the violin the lesson were abruptly discontinued when mammachi s teacher launsky tieffenthal made the mistake of telling pappachi that his wife wa exception ally talented and in his opinion potentially concert class mammachi pasted in the family photograph album the clipping from the indian express that reported pappachfs death it said noted entomologist shri benaan john ipe son of late rev e john ipe of ayemcnem popularly known a punnyan ku yu suffered a massive heart attack and passed away at the kottayam general hospital last night he developed chest pain around a m and wa rushed to hospital the end came at a m shri ipe had been keeping indifferent health since last six month he is survived by his wife soshamma and two child at pappachi s funeral mammachi cried and her contact lens slid around in her eye ammu told the twin that mammachi wa cry more because she wa used to him than because she loved him she wa used to having him slouching around the pickle factory and wa used to being beaten from time to time ammu said that human being were creature of habit and it wa amazing the kind of thing they could get used to you only had to look around you ammu said to see that beating with brass vas were the least of them after the funeral mammachi asked rahel to help herto locate and remove her contact lens with the little orange pipette that came in it own case rahel asked mammachi whether after mammachi died she could inherit the pipette ammu took her out of the room and smacked her t never want to hear you discussing people s death with them again she said i appachi s moth estha said rahel d served il for being so insensith e he phoiograph o pappachi in tenna with his hair slicked down wa n fvanied and pm up in the drawing room he wa a photogenic man dapper and carefully groomed with a little man s largeish head he had an incipient second chin that would have been emphasized had he looked down or nodded in the photograph he had taken care to hold his head high enough to hide his double chin yet not so high a to appear haughty his light brown eye were polite yet maleficent a though he wa making an effort to be cival to the photographer while plotting to murder his wife he had a little fleshy knob on the centre of his upper lip that dropped down over his lower lip in a sort of effeminate pout the kind that child who suck their thumb develop he had an elongated dimple on his chin which only sei ved to underline the threat of a lurking manic violence a sort of contained cruelty he wore khaki jodhpur though he had never ridden a horse in his life his riding boot reflected the photographer s studio light an ivory handled riding crop lay neatly across his lap there wa a watchful stillness to the photograph that lent an underlying chill to the warm room in which it hung when he died pappachi left trunk full of expensive suit and a chocolate tin full of cuff link that chacko distributed among the taxi driver in kottayam they w ere separated and made into ring and pendant for unmarried daughter dowry when the twin asked what cuff link were for to link cuff together ammu told them they were thrilled by this morsel of logic in what had so far seemed an illogical language link cuff linl this to them rivalled the precision and logic of mathematics ci link them an inordinate if exaggerated satisfaction and a real affection for the english language ammu said that pappachi wa an incurable british ccp which wa short for chhi chhi poach and in hindi meant shit wiper the god of small thing ghacko said that the correct word for people like pappachi wa anglophile he made rahel and estha look up anglophile in the reader s digest great encyclopaedic dictionary it said person well dis posed to the english then estha and rahel had to look up disposed it said place suitably in particular order bring mind into certain state do what one will with get off one s hand stow away demolish finish settle consume food kill sell ghacko said that in pappachi s case it meant bring mind into certain state which ghacko said meant that pappachi s mind had been brought into a state which made him like the english ghacko told the twin that though he hated to admit it they were all anglophile they were a family of anglophile pointed in the wrong direction trapped outside their own history and unable to retrace their step because their footprint had been swept away he explained to them that history wa like an old house at night with all the lamp lit and ancestor whispering inside to understand history ghacko said we have to go inside and listen to what they re saying and look at the book and the picture on the wall and smell the smell estha and rahel had no doubt that the house ghacko meant wa the house on the other side of the river in the middle of the abandoned rubber estate where they had never been kari saipu s house the black sahib the englishman who htad gone native who spoke malayalam and wore mundus aye menem s own kurtz ayemenem his private heart of darkness he had shot himself through the head ten year ago when his young lover s parent had taken the boy away from him and sent him to school after the suicide the property had become pappachi s moth the subject of extensive litigation between kari saipu s cook and his secretary the house had lain empty for year er few people had seen it but the twin could picture it the historv house with cool stone floor and dim wall and billowing ship shaped shadow plump translucent lizard lived behind old picture and waxy crumbling ancestor with tough toe nail and breath that smelled of yellow map gossiped in sibilant papeiv whisper but we can t go in ghacko explained because we ve been locked out and when we look in through the window all we see are shadow and w hen we try and listen all we hear is a whispering and we can not understand the whispering because our mind have been invaded by a war a war that we have won and lost the very worst sort of war a war that capture dream and re dream them a war that ha made u adore our conqueror and despise ourselves alayiy our conqueror is more like it ammu said drily referring to margaret kochamma ch ko ignored her he made the twin look up despise it said to look down upon to view with contempt to scorn or disdain ghacko said that in the context of the war he wa talking about the war of dream despise meant all those thing we re prisoner of war ghacko said our dream have been doctored we belong nowhere we sail unanchored on troubled sea we may never be allotved ashore our sorrow will never be sad enough our joy never happy enough our dream never big enough our life never important enough to matter then to give estha and rahel a sense of historical perspective though perspective wa something which in the week to follow ghacko himself would sorely lack he told them about the earth woman he made them imagine that the earth four thousand six hundred million year old wa a forty six year old woman the god of small thing a old say a alevamma teacher who eave them malayalam lesson it had taken the whole of the earth woman s life for the earth to become what it wa for the ocean to part for the mountain to rise the earth woman wa eleven year old ghacko said when the first single celled organism appeared the first animal creature like worm andjellyfish appeared only when she wa forty she wa over forty five just eight month ago when dinosaur roamed the earth the whole of human civilization a we know it chacko told the twin began only two hour ago in the earth woman s life a long a it take u to drive from ayemenem to cochin it wa an awe inspiring and humbling thought ghacko said humbling wa a nice word rahel thought humbling along with out a care in the world that the whole of contemporary history the world war the war of dream the man on the moon science literature philosophy the pursuit of knowledge wa no more than a blink of the earth woman s eye and we my dear everything we are and ever will be are just a twinkle in her eye chacko said grandly lying on his bed staring at the ceiling when he wa in this sort of mood chacko used his reading aloud voice his room had a church feeling he didn t care whether anyone wa listening to him or not and if they were he didn t care whether or not they had understood what he wa saying ammu called them his oxford mood later in the light of all that happened twinkle seemed com pletely the wrong word to describe the expression in the earth woman s eye twinkle wa a word with crinkled happy edge though the earth woman made a lasting impression on the twin it wa the history house so much closer at hand that really fascinated them they thought about it often the house on the other side of the river looming in the heart of darkness pappaghi s moth a house they couldn t enter full of whisper they couldn t understand they didn t know then that soon they would go in that they would cross the river and be where they weren t supposed to be with a man they weren t supposed to love that they would watch with dinner plate eye a history revealed itself to them in the back verandah while other child of their age learned other thing estha and rahel learned how history negotiates it term and collect it due from those who break it law they heard it sickening thud they smelled it smell and never forgot it history s sraell like old rose on a breeze it would lurk for ever in ordinary thing in coat hanger tomato in the tar on the road in certain colour in the plate at a restaurant in the absence of word and the empti ness in eye they would grow up grappling with way of living with what happened they would try to teu themselves that in term of geological time it wa an insignificant event just a blink of the earth woman s eye that worse thing had happened that worse thing kept happening but they would find no comfort in the thought chacko said that going to see the sound of music wa an extended exercise in anglophilia ammu said oh come on the whole world go to see the sound of music it s a world hit nevertheless my dear chacko said in his reading aloud voice never the less mammachi often said that chacko wa easily one of the cleverest men iii india according to whom ammu would say on what basis mammachi loved to teu the story chacko s story of how one of the don at oxford had said that in his the god of small thing opinion chacko wa brilliant and made of prime ministerial material to this ammu always said ha ha hal like people in the comic she said a going to oxfom didn t necessarily make a person clever b cleverness didn t necessarily make a good prime minister c if a person couldn t even run a pickle factory profitably how wa that person going to run a whole country and most important of all d all indian mother are obsessed with their son and are therefore poor judge of their ability chacko said a you don t go to oxford you read at oxford and b after reading at oxford you come down down to earth d you mean ammu would ask ttiat you definitely do like your famous airplane ammu said that the sad but entirely predictable fate of chacko s airplane wa an impartial measure of his ability once a month except during the monsoon a parcel would arrive for chacko by vpp it always contained a balsa aero modelling kit it usually took chacko between eight and ten day to assemble the aircraft with it tiny fuel tank and motorized propeller when it wa ready he would take estha and rahel to tire rice field in nattakom to help him fly it it never flew for more than a minute month after month chako s carefully constructed plane crashed in the slushgreen paddy field into which estha and rahel would spurt like trained retriever to salvage the remains a tail a tank a wing a wounded machine chacko s room wa cluttered with broken wooden plane pappaghl s moth and every month another kit would arrive chacko never blamed the crash on the kit it wa only after pappachi died that chacko resigned his job a lecturer at the madras christian college and came to ayemenem with his balliol oar and his pickle baron dream he commuted his pension and provident fund to buy a bharat bottle sealing machine his oar with his team mate name inscribed in gold hung from iron hoop on the factory v all up to the time chacko arrived the factory had been a small but profitable enterprise mammachi just ran it like a large kitchen chacko had it registered a a partnership and informed mammachi that she wa the sleeping partner he invested in equipment canning machine cauldron cooker and ex panded the labour force almost immediately the financial slide began but wa artificially buoyed by extravagant bank loan that chacko raised by mortgaging the family s rice field around the ayemenem house though ammu did a much work in the factory a chacko whenever he wa dealing with food inspector or sanitary engineer he always referred to it a my factory my pineapple my pickle legally this wa the case because ammu a a daughter had no claim to the property chacko told rahel and estha that ammu had no locust stand l thanks to our wonderful male chauvinist society ammu said chacko said what s yours is mine and what s mine is also mine he had a surprisingly high laugh for a man of his size and fatness and when he laughed he shook all over without appearing to move until chacko arrived in ayemenem mammachi s factory had no name everybody just referred to her pickle and jam the god of small thing a sosha s tender mango or sosha s banana jam sosha wa mammachi s first name soshamma it wa ghacko who christened the factory paradise pickle preserve and had label designed and printed at cjomrade k n m pillai s press at first he had wanted to call it zeus pickle preserve but that idea wa vetoed because everybody said that zeus wa too obscure and had no local relevance whereas paradise did comrade pillai s suggestion parashu ram pickle wa vetoed for the opposite reason too much local relevance it wa chacko s idea to have a billboard painted and installed on the plymouth s roof rack on the way to cochin now it rattled and made fallingoff noise near vaikom they had to stop to buy some rope to secure it more firmly that delayed them by another twenty minute rahel began to worry about being late for the sound of music then a they approached the outskirt of cochin the red and white arm of the railway level crossing gate went down rahel knew that this had happened because she had been hoping that it wouldn t she hadn t learned to control her hope yet estha said that that wa a bad sign so now they were going to miss the beginning of the picture when julie andrew start off a a speck on the hill and get bigger and bigger till she burst on to the screen with her voice like cold water and her breath like peppermint the red sign on the red and white arm said stop in white pot rahel said a yellow hoarding said be indian buy indian in red naidni yub naidni eb estha said the twin were precocious with their reading they had raced through old dog tom janet and john and their ronald ridout pappaghl s moth workbook at night ammu read to them from kipling s jungle book now chil the kite brings home the night that mang the bat set jiree the down on their arm would stand on end golden in the light of the bedside lamp a she read ammu could make her voice gravelly like shere khan s or whining like tabaqui s ye choose and ye do not choose talk is this of choosing by the bull that i killed am i to stand nosing into your dog s den for my fair due it is i shere khan who speak and it is raksha the demon who answer the twin would shout in high voice not together but almost the man s cub is mine lungri mine to me he shall not be killed he shall live to run with the pack and to hunt with the pack and in the end look you hunter of little naked cub frog eater fish killer he shall hunt theep baby kochamma who had been put in charge of their formal education had read them a version of the tempest abridged by charles and mary lamb where the bee suck there suck estha and rahel would go about saying in a cowslip s bell i he so when baby ko cha mma s australian missionary friend miss m itten gave estha and rahel a baby book the adventure of susie squirrel a a present when she visited ayemenem they were deeply offended first they read it forward miss mitten who belonged to a sect of born again christian said that she wa a little disappointed in them when they read it aloud to her backwards the god of small thing eht serutnevda fo eisus lerriuqs eno gnirps gninrom eisus lerriuqs ekow pu they showed miss mitten how it wa possible to read both malay alam nd madam pm adam backwards a well a forward she wasn t amused and it turned out that she didn t even know what malayalam wa they told her it wa the language every one spoke in kerala she said she had been under the impression that it wa called keralese estha who had by then taken an active dislike to miss mitten told her that a far a he wa concerned it wa a highly stupid impression miss mitten complained to baby kochamma about estha s rudeness and about their reading backwards she told baby kochamma that she had seen satan in their eye natas in their they were made to write in juture we will not read backwards in juture we will not read backwards a hundred time forward a few month later miss mitten wa killed by a milk van in hobart across the road from a cricket oval to the twin there wa hidden justice in the fact that the milk van had been reversing more bus and car had stopped on either side of the level crossing an ambulance that said sacred heart hospital wa full of a party of people on their way to a wedding the bride wa staring out of the back window her face partially obscured by the flaking paint of the huge red cross the bus all had girl name lucykutty mollykutty beena mol in malayalam mol is litde girl and mon is little boy beena mol wa full of pilgrim who d had their head sha ved at tirupati rahel could see a row of bald head at the bus window above evenly spaced vomit streak she wa more than a litde curious about vomiting she had never vomited not once estha had and when he did his skin grew hot and shiny and his eye helpless and beautiful and ammu loved him more o pappaghl s moth than usual chacko said that estha and rahel were indecently healthy and so wa sophie mol he said it wa because they didn t suffer from inbreeding like most syrian christian and parsee mammachi said that what her grandchild suffered from wa far worse than inbreeding she meant having parent who were divorced a though these were the only choice available to people inbreeding or divorce rahel wasn t sure what she suffered from but occasionally she practised sad face and sighing in the mirror it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done she would say to herself sadly that wa rahel being sydney carton being charles darnay a he stood on the step waiting to be guillotined in the classic illustrated comic s version of a t ale of two city she wondered what had caused the bald pilgrim to vomit so uniformly and whether they had vomited together in a single well orchestrated heave to music perhaps to the rhythm of a bus bhajan or separately one at a time initially when the level crossing had just closed the air wa full of the impatient sound of idling engine but when the man that manned the crossing came out of his booth on his backward bending leg and signalled with his limp flapping walk to the tea stall that they were in for a long wait driver switched off their engine and milled about stretching their leg with a desultory nod of his bored and sleepy head the level crossing divinity conjured up beggar with bandage men with tray selling piece of fresh coconut parippu vadas on banana leaf and cold drink coca cola fanta rosemilk a leper with soiled bandage begged at the car window that look like mercurochrome to me ammu said of his inordinately bright blood congratulation chacko said spoken like a true bour geoise i tke god of small thing ammu smiled and they shook hand a though she really wa being awarded a certificate of merit for being an honest to goodness genuine bourgeoise moment like these the twin treasured and threaded like precious bead on a somewhat scanty necklace rahel and estha squashed their nose against the plymouth s quarter window yearning marshmallow with cloudy child behind them ammu said no firmly and with conviction chacko lit a gharminar he inhaled deeply and then removed a little flake of tobacco that had stayed behind on his tongue inside the plymouth it wasn t easy for rahel to see estha because baby kochamma rose between them like a hill ammu had insisted that they sit separately to prevent them from fight ing when they fought estha called rahel a refugee stick insect rahel called him elvis the pelvis and did a twisty funny kind of dance that infuriated estha when they had serious physical fight they were so evenly matched that the fight went on for ever and thing that came in their way table lamp ashtray and water jug were smashed or irreparably damaged baby kochamma wa holding on to the back of the front seat with her arm when the car moved her armfat swung like heavy washing in the wind now it hung down like a fleshy curtain blocking estha from rahel on estha s side of the road wa the tea shack that sold tea and stale glucose biscuit in dim glass case with fly there wa lemon soda in thick bottle with blue marble stopper to keep the fizz in and a red ice box that said rather sadly thing go better with coca cola murlidharan the level crossing lunatic perched cross legged and perfectly balanced on the milestone his ball and penis dangled down pointing towards the sign which said cochin pappaghl s moth murlidharan wa naked except for the talus plastic bag that somebody had fitted onto his head like a transparent chef s cap through which the dew of the landscape continued dimmed chef shaped but uninterrupted he couldn t remove his cap even if had wanted to because he had no arm they had been blown off in singapore in within the first week of his running away from home to join the fighting rank of the indian national army after independence he had himself registered a a grade i freedom fighter and had been allotted a free first class railway pas for life this too he had lost along with his mind so he could no longer live on train or in refreshment room in railway station murlidharan had no home no door to lock but he had his old key tied carefully around his waist in a shining bunch his mind wa full of cupboard cluttered with secret pleasure ati alarm clock a red car with a musical horn a red mug for the bathroom a wife with a diamond a briefcase with important paper a coming home from the office an pm sony colonel sabhapatjy but pm afraid pve said rry say and crisp banana chip for the child he watched the train come and go he counted his key he watched government rise and fall he counted his key he watched cloudy child at car window with yearning marshmauow nose the homeless the helpless the sick the small and lost all filed past his window still he counted his key he wa never sure which cupboard he might have to open or when he sat on the burning milestone with his matted hair and eye like window and wa glad to be able to look away sometimes to have his key to count and countercheck number would do numbness would be fine murlidharan moved his mouth when he counted and made well formed word the god of small thing onner runder maonner estha noticed that the hair on his head wa curly grey the hair in his windy armless armpit wa wispy black and the hair in his crotch wa black and springy one man with three kind of hair estha wondered how that could be he tried to think of whom to ask the waiting filled rahel until she wa ready to burst she looked at her watch it wa ten to two she thought of julie andrew and christopher plummer kissing each other sideways so that their nose didn t collide she wondered whether people always kissed each other sideways she tried to think of whom to ask then from a distance a hum approached the held up traffic and covered it like a cloak the driver who d been stretching their leg got back into their vehicle and slammed door the beggar and vendor disappeared within minute there wa no one on the road except murlidharan perched with his bum on the burning milestone unperturbed and only mildly curious there wa husde bustle and police whistle from behind the line of waiting oncoming traffic a column of men appeared with red flag and banner and a hum that grew and grew tut up your window chacko said and stay calm they re not goin to hurt u why not join them comrade ammu said to chacko i ll drive chacko said nothing a muscle tensed below the wad of fat on his jaw he tossed away his cigarette and rolled up his window pappaghl s moth chacko wa a self proclaimed marxist he would call pretty woman who worked in the factory to his room and on the pretext of lecturing them on labour right and trade union law flirt with them outrageously he would call them comrade and insist that they call him comrade back w hich made them giggle much to their embarrassment and mammachi s dismay he forced them to sit at table with him and drink tea once he even took a group of them to attend trade union class that were held in aueppey they went by bus and returned by boat they came back happy with glass bangle and flower in their hair ammu said it wa all hogwash just a case of a spoiled prince ling playing comrade comrade an oxford avatar of the old zamindar mentality a landlord forcing his attention on woman who depended on him for their livelihood a the marcher approached ammu put up her window estha his rahel hers effortfuuy because the black knob on the handle had fallen off suddenly the skyblue plymouth looked absurdly opulent on the narrow pitted road like a wide lady squeezing down a narrow corridor like baby kochamma in church on her way to the bread and wine look down baby kochamma said a the front rank of the procession approached the car avoid eye contact that s what really provokes them on the side of her neck her pulse wa pounding within minute the road wa swamped by thousand of marching people automobile island in a river of people the air wa red with flag which dipped and lifted a the marcher ducked under the level crossing gate and swept across the rail way track in a red wave the sound of a thousand voice spread over the frozen traffic like a noise umbrella the god of small thing inquilab ndahad thozhilali ekta indabadv long live the revolution they shouted worker of the world unite even chacko had no really complete explanation for why the communist party wa so much more successful in kerala than it had been almost anywhere else in india except perhaps in bengal there were several competing theory one wa that it had to do with the large population of christian in the state twenty per cent of kerala s population were syrian christian who believed that they were descendant of the one hundred brah min whom saint thomas the apostle converted to christianity when he travelled east after the resurrection structurally this somewhat rudimentary argument went marxism wa a simple substitute for christianity replace god with marx satan with the bourgeoisie heaven with a classless society the church with the party and the form and purpose of the journey remained similar an obstacle race with a prize at the end whereas the hindu mind had to make more complex adjust ments the trouble with this theory wa that in kerala the syrian christian were by and large the wealthy estate owning pickle factory running feudal lord for whom communism represented a fate worse than death they had always voted for the congress party a second theory claimed that it had to do with the compara tively high level of literacy in the state perhaps except that the high literacy level wa largely because of the communist movement the real secret wa that communism crept into kerala insidi ously a a reformist movement that never overtly questioned the traditional value of a caste ridden extremely traditional community the marxist worked from within the communal pappachl s xmoth divide never challenging them never appearing not to they offered a cocktail revolution a heady mix of eastern marxism and orthodox hinduism spiked with a shot of democracy though ghacko wa not a card holding member of the part he had been converted early and had remained through all it travail a committed supporter he wa an undergraduate at delhi university during the euphoria of when the communist won the state assembly election and nehru invited them to form a government ghacko s hero comrade e m s namboodiripad the flam boyant brahmin high priest of marxism in kerala became chief minister of the first ever democratically elected communist government in the world suddenly the communist found them self in the extraordinary critic said absurd position of having to govern a people and foment revolution simul taneously comrade e m s namboodiripad evolved his own theory about how he would do this chacko studied his treatise on the peacejul transition to communism with an adolescent s obsessive diligence and an ardent fan s unquestioning approval it set out in detail how comrade e m s namboodiripad s government intended to enforce land reform neutralize the police subvert the judiciary and restrain the hand of the reactionary anti people congress government at the gentre unfortunately before the year wa out the peaceful part of the peaceful transition came to an end every morning at breakfast the imperial entomologist derided his argumentative marxist son by reading out news paper report of the riot strike and incident of police brutality that convulsed kerala so karl marx pappachi would sneer when chacko came to the table what shall we do with these bloody student now the stupid goon are agitating against our people s govern ment shall we annihilate them surely student aren t people any more the god of small thing over the next two year the political discord fuelled by the congress party and the church slid into anarchy by the time chacko finished his ba and left for oxford to do another one kerala wa on the brink of civil war nehru dismissed the communist government and announced fresh election the congress party returned to power it wa only in almost exactly ten year after they first came to power that comrade e m s namboodiripad s party wa re elected this time a part of a coalition between what had now become two separate party the communist party of india and the communist party of india marxist the cpi and the cpi m pappachi wa dead by then chacko divorced paradise pickle wa seven year old kerala wa reeling in the aftermath of famine and a failed monsoon people were dying hunger had to be very high up on any government list of priority during liis second term in office comrade e m s went about implementing the peaceful transition more soberly this earned him the wrath of the chinese communist party they denounced him for his parliamentary cretinism and accused him of pro viding relief to the people and thereby blunting the people s consciousness and diverting them from the revolution peking switched it patronage to the newest most militant faction of the cpi m the naxalites who had staged an armed insurrection in naxalbari a village in bengal they organized peasant into fighting cadre seized land expelled the owner and established people s court to try class enemy the nax alite movement spread across the country and struck terror in every bourgeois heart in kerala they breathed a plume of excitement and fear into the already fiightened air killing had begun in the north that may there wa a blurred photograph in the paper of a landlord in palghat who had been tied to a lamp post and beheaded pappaghl s moth his head lay on it side some distance away from his body in a dark puddle that could have been water could have been blood it wa hard to tell in black and white in the grey pre dawn light his surprised eye were open comrade e m s namboodiripad running dog soviet stooge expelled the naxalites from his party and went on with the business of harnessing anger for parliamentary purpose the march that surged around the skyblue plymouth on that skyblue december day wa a part of that process it had been organized by the travancore gochin marxist labour union their comrade in trivandrum would march to the secretariat and present the charter of people s demand to comrade e m s himself the orchestra petitioning it conductor their demand were that paddy worker who were made to work in the field for eleven and a half hour a day from seven in the morning to six thirty in the evening be permitted to take a one hour lunch break that woman s wage be increased from one rupee twenty five paisa a day to three rupee and men s from two rupee fifty paisa to four rupee fifty paisa a day they were also demanding that untouchable no longer be addressed by their caste name they demanded not to be addressed a achoo parayan or kelan paravan or kuttan pulayan but just a achoo or kelan or kuttan cardamom king coffee count and rubber baron old boarding school buddy came down from their lonely far flung estate and sipped chilled beer at the sailing club they raised their glass rose by any other name they said and sniggered to hide their rising panic the marcher that day were party worker student and the labourer themselves touchables and untouchable on their shoulder they carried a keg of ancient anger lit with a recent fuse there wa an edge to this anger that wa naxalite and new the god of small thing through the plymouth window rahel could see that the loudest word they said wa ndabad and that the vein stood out in their neck when they said it and that the arm that held the flag and banner were knotted and hard inside the plymouth it wa still and hot baby kochamma s fear lay rolled up on the car floor like a damp clammy cheroot this wa just the beginning of it the fear that over the year would grow to consume her that would make her lock her door and window that would give her two hairline and both her mouth hers too wa an ancient age old fear the fear of being dispossessed she tried to count the green bead on her rosary but couldn t concentrate an open hand slammed against the car window a balled fist banged down on the burning skyblue bonnet it sprang open the plymouth looked like an angular blue animal in a zoo asking to be fed a bun a banana another balled fist slammed down on it and the bonnet closed ghacko rolled down his window and called out to the man who had done it thanks ketov he said valarey thanks don t be so ingratiating comrade ammu said it wa an accident he didn t really mean to help how could he possibly know that in this old car there beat a truly marxist heart ammu ghacko said his voice steady and deliberately casual is it at all possible for you to prevent your washed up cynicism from completely colouring everything silence filled the car like a saturated sponge washed up cut like a knife through a soft thing the sun shone with a shud dering sigh this wa the trouble with family like invidious doctor they knew just where it hurt pappaghi s moth just then rahel saw velutha vellya paapen s son velutha her most beloved friend velutha velutha marching with a red flag in a white shirt and mundu with angr vein in his ne k he never usually wore a shirt rahel rolled down her window in a flash velutha velutha she called to him he froze for a moment and listened with his flag what he heard wa a familiar voice in a most unfamiliar circumstance rahel standing on the car seat had growm out of the plymouth window like the loose flailing horn of a car shaped herbivore with a fountain in a love in toky o and yellow rimmed red plastic sunglass velutha ividay velutha and she too had vein in her neck he stepped sideways and disappeared deftly into the angriness around him inside the car ammu whirled around and her eye were angry she slapped at rahel s calf which were the only part of her left in the car to slap calf and brown foot in bata sandal behave yourself ammu said baby kochamma pulled rahel down and she landed on the seat with a surprised thump she thought there d been a misunderstanding it wa velutha she explained with a smile and he had a flag the flag had seemed to her a most impressive piece of equip ment the right thing for a friend to have you re a stupid silly little girl ammu said her sudden fierce anger pinned rahel against the car seat rahel wa puzzled why wa ammu so angry about what but it wa him rahel said shut up ammu said rahel saw that ammu had a film of perspiration on her forehead and upper lip and that her eye had become hard the god of small thing like marble like pappachi s in the vienna studio photograph how pappachi s moth whispered in his child s vein baby kochamma rolled up rahel s window year later on a crisp fall morning in upstate new york on a sunday train from grand central to croton harmon it sud denly came back to rahel that expression on ammu s face like a rogue piece in a puzzle like a question mark that drifted through the page of a book and never settled at the end of a sentence that hard marble look in ammu s eye the glisten of pers piration on her upper lip and the chill of that sudden hurt silence what had it all meant the sunday train wa almost empty across the aisle from rahel a woman with chapped cheek and a moustache coughed up phlegm and wrapped it in twist of newspaper that she tore off the pile of sunday paper on her lap she arranged the little package in neat row on the empty seat in front of her a though she wa setting up a phlegm stall a she worked she chatted to herself in a pleasant soothing voice memory wa that woman on the train insane in the way she sifted through dark thing in a closet and emerged with the most unlikely one a fleeting look a feeling the smell of smoke a windscreen wiper a mother s marble eye quite sane in the way she left huge tract of darkness veiled un remembered her co passenger s madness comforted rahel it drew her closer into new york s deranged womb away from the other more terrible thing that haunted her sourmetal smell like steel bus rail and the smell of the bus conductor s hand from holding them a young man with an old man s mouth outside the train the hudson shimmered and the tree were the redbrown colour of fall it wa just a little cold pappaghl s moth there s a nipple in the air larry mccaslin said to rahei and laid his palm gently against the suggestion of protest from a chilly nipple through her cotton t shirt he wondered why she didn t smile she wondered why it wa that when she thought of home it wa always in the colour of the dark oiled wood of boat and the empty core of the tongue of flame that flickered in brass lamp it wa velutha that much rahei wa sure of she d seen him he d seen her she d have known him anywhere any time and if he hadn t been wearing a shirt she would have recognized him from behind she knew his back she d been carried on it more time than she could count it had a light browm birthmark shaped like a pointed dry leaf he said it wa a lucky leaf that made the monsoon come on time a brown leaf on a black back an autumn leaf at night a lucky leaf that wasn t lucky enough velutha wasn t supposed to be a carpenter he wa called velutha which mean white in malayalam because he wa so black his father veliya paapen wa a paravan a toddy tapper he had a glass eye he had been shaping a block of granite with a hammer when a chip flew into his left eye and sliced right through it a a young boy velutha would come with veliya paapen to the back entrance of the ayemenem house to deliver the coco nut they had plucked from the tree in the compound pappachi would not allow paravans into the house nobody would they were not allowed to touch anything that touchables touched caste hindu and caste christian mammachi told estha and rahei that she could remember a time in her girlhood when paravans were expected to crawl backwards with a broom the god of small thing sweeping away their footprint so that brahmin or syrian chris tians would not defile themselves by accidentally stepping into a paravan s footprint in mammachi s time paravans like other untouchable were not allowed to walk on public road not allowed to cover their upper body not allowed to carry umbrella they had to put their hand over their mouth when they spoke to divert their polluted breath away from those whom they addressed when the british came to malabar a number of paravans pelayas and pulayas among them velutha s grandfather kelan converted to christianity and joined the anglican church to escape the scourge of untouchability a added incentive they were given a little food and money they were known a the rice christian it didn t take them long to realize that they had jumped from the frying pan into the fire they were made to have separate church with separate service and separate priest a a special favour they were even given their own separate pariah bishop after independence they found they were not entitled to any government benefit like job reser vations or bank loan at low interest rate because officially on paper they were christian and therefore casteless it wa a little like having to sweep away your footprint without a broom or worse not being allowed to leave footprint at alf it wa mammachi on vacation from delhi and imperial entomology who first noticed little velutha s remarkable facility with his hand velutha wa eleven then about three year younger than ammu he wa like a little magician he could make intricate toy tiny windmill rattle minute jewel box out of dried palm reed he could carve perfect boat out of tapioca stem and figurine on cashew nut he would bring them for ammu holding them out on his palm a he had been taught so she wouldn t have to touch him to take them though he wa younger than she wa he called her ammukutty little ammu mammachi persuaded vellya paapen to send him to pappaghl s moth the untouchable school that her father in law punnyan kunju had founded velutha wa fourteen when johann klein a carpenter from a carpenter guild in bavaria came to kottayam and spent three year with the christian mission society conducting a workshop with local carpenter eveity afternoon after school velutha caught a bus to kottayam where he worked with klein till dusk by the time he wa sixteen velutha had finished high school and wa an accomplished carpenter he had his own set of carpentry tool and a distinctly german design sensibility he built mammachi a bauhaus dining table with twelve dining chair in rosewood and a traditional bavarian chaise longue in lighter jack for baby kochamma s annual nativity play s he made her a stack of wire framed angel wing that fitted onto child s back like knapsack cardboard cloud for the angel gabriel to appear between and a dismantleable manger for christ to be born in when her garden cherub s silver arc dried up inexplicably it wa dr velutha who fixed it bladder for her apart from his carpentry skill velutha had a way with machine mammachi with impenetrable touchable logic often said that if only he hadn t been a paravan he might have become an engineer he mended radio clock water pump he looked after the plumbing and all the electrical gadget in the house when mammachi decided to enclose the back verandah it wa velutha who designed and built the sliding folding door that later became all the rage in ayemenem velutha knew more about the machine in the factory than anyone else when chacko resigned his job in madras and returned to ayemenem with a bharat bottle sealing machine it wa velutha who reassembled it and set it up it wa velutha who maintained the new canning machine and the automatic pineapple sheer the god of small thing velutha who oiled the water pump and the small diesel gener ator velutha who built the aluminium sheet lined easy to clean cutting surface and the ground level furnace for boiling fruit velutha s father vellya paapen however wa an old world paravan he had seen the crawling backwards day and his gratitude to mammachi and her family for all that they had done for him wa a wide and deep a a river in spate when he had his accident with the stone chip mammachi organized and paid for his glass eye he hadn t worked off his debt yet and though he knew he wasn t expected to that he wouldn t ever be able to he felt that his eye wa not his own his gratitude widened his smile and bent his back vellya paapen feared for his younger son he couldn t say what it wa that frightened him it wa nothing that he had said or done it wa not what he said but the way he said it not what he did but the way he did it perhaps it wa just a lack of hesitation an unwarranted assurance in the way he walked the way he held his head the quiet way he offered suggestion without being asked or the quiet way in which he disregarded suggestion without appearing to rebel while these were quality that were perfecdy acceptable perhaps even desirable in touchables vellya paapen thought that in a paravan they could and would and indeed should be construed a insolence vellya paapen tried to caution velutha but since he couldn t put his finger oh what it wa that bothered him velutha mi understood his muddled concern to him it appeared a though his father grudged him his brief training and his natural skill vellya paapen s good intention quickly degenerated into nag ging and bickering and a general air of unpleasantness between father and son much to his mother s dismay velutha began to avoid going home he worked late he caught fish in the pappaghl s moth river and cooked it on an open fire he slept outdoors on the bank of the river then one day he disappeared for four year nobody knew where he wa there wa a rumour that he wa working on a building site for the department of welfare and housing in trivandrum and more recently the inevitable rumour that he had become a naxalite that he had been to prison somebody said they had seen him in quilon there wa no way of reaching him when his mother chella died of tuberculosis then kuttappen his older brother fell off a coconut tree and damaged his spine he wa paralysed and unable to work velutha heard of the accident a whole year after it happened it had been five month since he returned to ayemenem he never talked about where he had been or what he had done mammachi rehired velutha a the factory carpenter and put him in charge of general maintenance it caused a great deal of resentment among the other touchable factory worker because according to them paravans were not meant to be carpenter and certainly prodigal paravans were not meant to be rehired to keep the others happy and since she knew that nobody else would hire him a a carpenter mammachi paid velutha less than she would a touchable carpenter but more than she would a paravan mammachi didn t encourage him to enter the house except when she needed something mended or installed she thought that he ought to be grateful that he wa allowed on the factory premise at all and allowed to touch thing that touchables touched she said that it wa a big step for a paravan when he returned to ayemenem after his year away from home velutha stiu had about him the same quickness the sureness and veuya paapen feared for him now more than ever but this time he held his peace he said nothing the god of small thing at least not until the terror took hold of him not until he saw night after night a little boat being rowed across the river not until he saw it return at dawn not until he saw what his untouchable son had touched more than touched entered loved when the terror took hold of him vellya paapen went to mammachi he stared straight ahead with his mortgaged eye he wept with his own one one cheek glistened with tear the other stayed dry he shook his own head from side to side to side till mammachi ordered him to stop he trembled his own body like a man with malaria mammachi ordered him to stop it but he couldn t because you can t order fear around not even a paravan s vellya paapen told mammachi what he had seen he asked god s forgiveness for having spawned a monster he offered to kill his son with his own bare hand to destroy what he had created in the next room baby kochamma heard the noise and came to find out what it wa all about she saw grief and trouble ahead and secredy in her heart of heart she exulted she said among other thing how could she stand the smell haven tyou noticed th have a particular smell these paravans and she shuddered theatrically like a child being force fed spinach she preferred an irish jesuit smell to a particular paravan smell by far by far velutha vellya paapen and kuttappen lived in a little laterite hut downriver from the ayemenem house a three minute run through the coconut tree for esthappen and rahel they had only just arrived at ayemenem with ammu and were too young to remember velutha when he left but in the month since he had returned they had grown to be the best of friend they were forbidden from visiting his house but they did they would pappaghl s moth sit with him for hour on their haunch hunched punctuation mark in a pool of wood shaving and wonder how he aiways seemed to know what smooth shape waited inside the wood for him they loved the way wood in velutha s hand seemed to soften and become a pliable a plasticine he wa teaching them to use a planer his house on a good day smelled of fresh wood shaving and the sun of red fish curry cooked with black tamar ind the best fish curry according to estha in the whole world it wa velutha who made rahel her luckiest ever fishing rod and taught her and estha to fish and on that skyblue december day it wa him that she saw through her red sunglass marching with a red flag at the level crossing outside cochin steelshrill police whistle pierced hole in the noise umbrella through the jagged umbrella hole rahel could see piece of red sky and in the red sky hot red kite wheeled looking for rat in their hooded yellow eye there wa a road and red flag marching and a white shirt over a black back with a birthmark marching terror sweat and talcum powder blended into a mauve paste between baby kochamma s ring of neckfat spit coagulated into little white gob at the comer of her mouth she imagined she saw a man in the procession who looked like the photograph in the newspaper of the naxalite called rajan who wa rumoured to have moved south from palghat she imagined he had looked straight at her a man with a red flag and a face like a knot opened rahefs door because it wasn t locked the doorway wa full of men who d stopped to stare feeling hot baby the man like a knot asked rahel kindly in malayalam then unkindly ask your daddy to buy you an air condition and he hooted with delight at his own wit and timing rahel smiled back at him pleased to have chacko mistaken for her father like a normal family the god of small thing don t answer baby kochamma whispered hoarsely look down just look down the man with the flag turned his attention to her she wa looking down at the floor of the car like a coy frightened bride who had been married off to a stranger hello sister the man said carefully in english what is your name please when baby kochamma didn t answer he looked back at his co heckler she ha no name what about modalali mariakutty someone suggested with a giggle modalali in malayalam mean landlord a b c d x y z somebody else said irrelevantly more student crowded around they all wore handkerchief or printed bombay dyeing hand towel on their head to stave off the sun they looked like extra who had wandered off the set of the malayalam version of sinbad the last voyage the man like a knot gave baby kochamma his red flag a a present here he said hold it baby kochamma held it still not looking at him wave it he ordered she had to wave it she had no choice it smelled of new cloth and a shop crisp and dusty she tried to wave it a though she wasn t waving it now say inquilab j ndabadv inquilab ndabad baby kochamma whispered good girl the crowd roared with laughter a shrill whistle blew okay then the man said to baby kochamma in english a though they had successfully concluded a business deal bye bye he slammed the skyblue door shut baby kochamma wobbled the crowd around the car unclotted and went on with it march o pappachl s moth baby kochamma rolled the red flag up and put it on the ledge behind the back seat she put her rosary back into her blouse where she kept it with her melon she busied herself with this and that trying to salvage some dignity after the last few men walked past chacko said it wa all right now to roll down the window are you sure it wa him chacko asked rahel who rahel said suddenly cautious are you sure it wa velutha hmmm rahel said playing for time tiydng to decipher estha s frantic thought signal i said are you sure that the man you saw wa velutha chacko said for the third time mmm nyes nn nnalmost rahel said you re almost sure chacko said no it wa almost velutha rahel said it almost looked like him so you re not sure then almost not rahel slid a look at estha for approval it must have been him baby kochamma said it s trivand rum that s done this to him they all go there and come back thinking they re some great politico nobody seemed particularly impressed by her insight we should keep an eye on him baby kochamma said if he start this union business in the factory i ve noticed some sign some rudeness some ingratitude the other day i asked him to help me with the rock for my scree bed and he i saw velutha at home before we left estha said brightly so how could it be him for his own sake baby kochamma said darkly i hope it wasn t and next time esthappen don t interrupt she wa annoyed that nobody asked her what a scree bed wa i the god of small thing in the day that followed baby kochamma focused all her fury at her public humiliation on velutha she sharpened it like a pencil in her mind he grew to represent the march and the man who had forced her to wave the marxist party flag and the man who christened her modalali mariakutty and all the men who had laughed at her she began to hate him from the way ammu held her head rahel could tell that she wa still angry rahel looked at her watch ten to two still no train she put her chin on the window sill she could feel the grey gristle of the felt that cushioned the window glass pressing into her chinskin she took off her sunglass to get a better look at the dead frog squashed on the road it wa so dead and squashed so flat that it looked more like a frog shaped stain on the road than a frog rahel wondered if miss mitten had been squashed into a miss mitten shaped stain by the milk truck that killed her with the certitude of a true believer vellya paapen had assured the twin that there wa no such thing in the world a a black cat he said that there were only black cat shaped hole in the universe there were so many stain on the road squashed miss mitten shaped stain in the universe squashed frog shaped stain in the universe squashed crow that had tried to eat the squashed frog shaped stain in the universe squashed dog that ate the squashed crow shaped stain in the universe feather mango spit all the way to cochin the sun shone through the plymouth window directly down at rahel she closed her eye and shone back at it even behind her eyelid the light wa bright and hot the sky wa orange pappaghl s moth and the coconut tree were sea anemone waving their tentacle hoping to trap and eat an unsuspecting cloud a transparent spotted snake with a forked tongue floated across the sky then a transparent roman soldier on a spotted horse the strange thing about roman soldier in the comic according to rahel wa the amount of trouble they took over their armour and their helmet and then after all that they left their leg bare it didn t make any sense at all weatherwise or other wise ammu had told them the story of julius caesar and how he wa stabbed by brutus his best friend in the senate and how he fell to the floor with knife in his back and said et tu brute then fall caesar it just go to show ammu said that you can t trust anybody mother father brother husband bestfriend no body with child she said when they asked it remained to be seen she said it wa entirely possible for instance that estha could grow up to be a male chauvinist pig at night estha would stand on his bed with his sheet wrapped around him and say tu brute then fail caesar and crash into bed without bending his knee like a stabbed corpse kochu maria who slept on the floor on a mat said that she would complain to mammachi tell your mother to take you to your father s house she said there you can break a many bed a you like these aren t your bed this sn your house estha would rise from the dead stand on his bed and say et tu kochu maria then fall estha and die again kochu maria wa sure that et tu wa an obscenity in english and wa waiting for a suitable opportunity to complain about estha to mammachi the woman in the neighbouring car had biscuit crumb on her mouthi her husband lit a bent after biscuit cigarette he the god of small thing exhaled two tusk of smoke through his nostril and for a fleeting moment looked like a wild boar mr boar asked rahel her name in a baby voice rahel ignored her and blew an inadvertent spit bubble ammu hated them blowing spit bubble she said it reminded her of baba their father she said that he used to blow spit bubble and shiver his leg according to ammu only clerk behaved like that not aristocrat aristocrat were people who didn t blow spit bubble or shiver their leg or gobble though baba wasn t a clerk ammu said he often behaved like one when they were alone estha and rahel sometimes pretended that they were clerk they would blow spit bubble and shiver their leg and gobble like turkey they remembered th r father whom they had known between war he once gave them puff from his cigarette and got annoyed because they had sucked it and wet the filter with spit it s not a ruddy sweet he said genuinely angry they remembered his anger and ammu s they remem bered being pushed around a room once from ammu to baba to ammu to baba like billiard ball ammu pushing estha away here you keep one of them i can t look after them both later when estha asked ammu about that she hugged him and said he mustn t imagine thing in the only photograph they had seen of him which ammu allowed them to look at once he wa wearing a white shirt and glass he looked like a handsome studious cricketer with one arm he held estha on his shoulder estha wa smiling with his chin resting on his father s head rahel wa held against his body with his other arm she looked grumpy and bad tempered with her babylegs dangling someone had painted rosy blob on to their cheek ammu said that he had only carried them for the photograph pappachl s moth and even then had been so drunk that she wa scared he d drop them ammu said she d been standing just outside the photograph ready to catch them if he did still except for their cheek estha and rahei thought it wa a nice photograph will you stop that ammu said so loudly that imurlidharan who had hopped off the milestone to stare into the plymouth backed off his stump jerking in alarm what rahei said but knew immediately what her spit bubble sorry ammu sorry doesn t make a dead man alive estha said oh come on ghacko said you can t dictate what she doe with her own spitv mind your own business ammu snapped it brings back memory estha in his wisdom explained to ghacko rahei put on her sunglass the world became angry coloured take off those ridiculous glass ammu said rahei took off her ridiculous glass it s fascist the way you deal with them ghacko said even child have some right for god s sake don t use the name of the lord in vain baby kochamma said i m not ghacko said i m using it for a very good reason stop posing a the child s great saviour ammu said when it come down to brass tack you don t give a damn about them or me should i ghacko said are they my responsibility he said that ammu and estha and rahei were millstone around his neck the back of rahel s leg went wet and sweaty her skin slipped on the foamleather upholstery of the car seat she and estha knew about millstone in mutiny on the bounty when people died at sea they were wrapped in white sheet and thrown the god of small thing overboard with millstone around their neck so that the corps wouldn t float estha wasn t sure how they decided how many millstone to take with them before they set off on their voyage estha put his head in his lap his puff wa spoiled a distant train rumble seeped upwards from the frog stained road the yam leaf on either side of the railway track began to nod in mass consent tesye e e e the bald pilgrim in beena mol began another bhajan i tell you these hindu baby kochamma said piously they have no sense of privacy they have horn and scaly skin chacko said sarcastically and i ve heard that their baby hatch from egg rahel had two bump on her forehead that estha said would grow into horn at least one of them would because she wa half hindu she hadn t been quick enough to ask him about his horn because whatever she wa he wa too the train slammed past under a column of dense black smoke there were thirty two bogy and the doorway were full of young men with helmety haircut who were on their way to the edge of the world to see what happened to the people who fell off those of them who craned too far fell off the edge them self into the flailing darkness their haircut turned inside out the train wa gone so quickly that it wa hard to imagine that everybody had waited so long for so little the yam leaf continued to nod long after the train had gone a though they agreed with it entirely and had no doubt at all a gossamer blanket of coaldust floated down like a dirty blessing and gently smothered the traffic chacko started the plymouth baby kochamma tried to be jolly she started a song pappachi s moth there s a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall and the bell in the stee ple too and up in the nursery an ab urd litt le bird is popping out to say she looked at estha and rahel waiting for them to say cu ckoo they didn t a carbreeze blew greentrees and telephone pole flew past the window still bird slid by on moving wire like unclaimed baggage at the airport a pale daymoon hung hugely in the sky and went where they went a big a the belly of a beer drinking man big man small man the laltain the mombatti filth had laid siege to the ayemenem house like a medieval army advancing on an enemy castle it clotted every crevice and clung to the windowpane midge whizzed in teapot dead insect lay in empty vas the floor wa sticky white wall had turned an uneven grey brass hinge and doorhandle were dull and greasy to the touch infrequently used plug point were clogged with grime light bulb had a film of oil on them the only thing that shone were the giant cockroach that scurried around like varnished gofer on a film set baby kochamma had stopped noticing these thing long ago kochu maria who noticed everything had stopped caring the chaise longue on which baby kochamma reclined had crushed peanut shell stuffed into the crevice of it rotting upholstery in an unconscious gesture of television enforced democracy mistress and seiyant both scrabbled unseeingly in the same bowl of nut kochu maria tossed nut into her mouth baby kochamma placed them decorously in hers on the best of donahue the studio audience watched a clip from a film in which a black busker wa singing somewhere over the rainbow in a subway station he sang sincerely a though he really believed the word of the song baby kochamma sang big m a n r h e l a l t a in s m all max the m o m b a t t i with him her thin quavering voice thickened with peanut paste she smiled a the lyric came back to her kochu iaria looked at her a though she had gone mad and grabbed more than her fair share of nut the busker threw his head back when he hit the high note the where of somewhere and the ridged pink roof of his mouth filled the television screen he wa a ragged a a rock star but his missing teeth and the unhealthy pallor of his skin spoke eloquently of a life of privation and despair he had to stop singing each time a train arrived or left which wa often then the light went up in the studio and donahue presented the man himself who on a prearranged cue started the song from exactly the point that he had had to stop for a train cleverly achieving a touching victory of song over subway the next time the busker wa interrupted mid song wa only when phil donahue put his arm around him and said thank you thank you very much being interrupted by phil donahue wa of course entirely different from being interrupted by a subway rumble it wa a pleasure an honour the studio audience clapped and looked compassionate the busker glowed with prime time happiness and for a few moment deprivation took a back seat it had been his dream to sing on the donahue show he said not realizing that he had just been robbed of that too there are big dream and little one big man the laltain sahib small man the mombatti an old bihari coolie who met estha s school excursion party at the railway station unfailingly year after year used to say of dream big man the lantern small man the tallow stick huge man the strobe light he omitted to say and small man the subway station the master would haggle with him a he trudged behind them with the boy luggage his bowed leg further bowed the god of small thing cruel schoolboy imitating his gait ball in bracket they used to call him smallest man the varicose vein he clean forgot to mention a he wobbled off with less than half the money he had asked for and less than a tenth of what he deserved outside the rain had stopped the grey sky curdled and the cloud resolved themselves into litde lump like substandard mattress stuffing esthappen appeared at the kitchen door wet and wiser than he really wa behind him the long grass sparkled the puppy stood on the step beside him raindrop slid across the curved bottom of the rusted gutter on the edge of the roof like shining bead on an abacus baby kochamma looked up from the television here he come she announced to rahel not bothering to lower her voice now watch he won t say anything he ll walk straight to his room just watch the puppy seized the opportunity and tried to stage a com bined entry kochu maria hit the floor fiercely with her palm and said hup hup poda pattip so the puppy wisely desisted it appeared to be familiar with this routine watch baby kochamma said she seemed excited he ll walk straight to his room and wash his clothes he s very over clean he won t say a wordv she had the air of a game warden pointing out an animal in the grass taking pride in her ability to predict it movement her superior knowledge of it habit and predilection estha s hair wa plastered down in clump like the inverted petal of a flower sliver of white scalp shone through rivulet of water ran down his face and neck he walked to his room a gloating halo appeared around baby kochamma s head see she said big m a n the e a l t a i n small m a n the mo m b a t t i kochu imarici used the opportunity to switch channel and watch a bit of prime body rahel followed estha to his room ammu s room once the room had kept his secret it gave nothing away not in the disarray of rumpled sheet nor the untidiness of a kicked off shoe or a wet towel hung ov er the back of a chair or a half read book it wa like a room in a hospital after the nurse had just been the floor wa clean the wall white the cup board closed shoe arranged the dustbin empty the obsesswe cleanliness of the room wa the only positive sign of volition from estha the only faint suggestion that he had perhaps some design for life just the whisper of an unwillingness to subsist on scrap offered by others on the w all by the window an iron stood on an ironing board a pile of folded crumpled clothes waited to be ironed silence hung in the air like secret loss the terrible ghost of impossible to fbrget toy s clustered on the blade of the ceiling fan a catapult a qantas koala from miss mitten with loosened button eye an inflatable goose that had been burst with a policeman s cigarette two ballpoint pen with silent streetscapes and red london bus that floated up and down in them estha put on the tap and water drummed into a plastic bucket he undressed in the gleaming bathroom he stepped out of his sodden jean stiff dark blue difficult to get out of he pulled his crushed strawberry t shirt over his head smooth slim mu cular arm crossed over his body he didn t hear his sister at the door rahel watched his stomach suck inwards and his ribcage rise a his wet t shirt peeled away from his skin leaving it w et and honey coloured his face and neck and a shaped triangle at the base of his throat were darker than the rest of him his arm too were double coloured paler where his shirtsleeve the god of small thing ended a dark brown man in pale honey clothes chocolate with a twist of coffee high cheekbone and hunted eye a fisherman in a white tiled bathroom with sea secret in his eye had he seen her wa he really mad did he know that she wa there they had never been shy of each other s body but they had never been old

hipped tell her she ll need a caesarean a drunk gynaecologist had said to her husband while they waited for their change at the gas station a lizard on a map on her faded t shirt long wild hair with a glint of deep henna red sent unruly finger down into the small of her back the diamond in her nostril flashed sometimes and sometimes not a thin gold serpent headed bangle glow ed like a circle of orange light around her wrist slim snake whispering to each other head to head her mother s melted wedding ring down softened the sharp line of her thin angular arm at first glance she appeared to have grown into the skin of her mother high cheekbone deep dimple when she smiled but she wa longer harder flatter more angular than ammu had been less lovely perhaps to those who liked roundness and softness in woman only her eye v ere incontestably more beautiful large luminous drownabk in a larry mccaslin had said and discovered to his cost rahel searched her brother s nakedness for sign of herself in the shape of his knee the arch of his instep the slope of his big man the l a l t a i n small man the m o m b a t t i shoulder the angle at which the rest of his arm met his elbow the way his toe nail tipped upwards at the end the sculpted hollow on either side of his taut beautiful bun tight plum men s bum never grow up like school satchel they evoke in an instant memory of childhood two accination mark on his arm gleamed like coin hers were on her thigh girl alw ays have them on their thigh ammu used to sa rahel watched estha with the curiosity of a mother watching her wet child a sister a brother a woman a man a twin a twin she flew these several kite at once he wa a naked stranger met in a chance encounter he wa the one that she had known before life began the one who had once led her swimming through their lovely mother s cunt both thing unbearable in their polarity in their irreconcil able far apartness a raindrop glistened on the end of estha s earlobe thick silver in the light like a hea ty bead of mercury she reached out touched it took it away estha didn t look at her he retreated into further stillness a though his body had the power to snatch it sens inwards knotted egg shaped away from the surface of his skin into some deeper more inaccessible recess the silence gathered it skirt and slid like spiderwoman up the slippery bathroom wall estha put his wet clothes in a bucket and began to wash them with crumbling bright blue soap abhilash talkie abhilash talkie advertised itself a the first cinema hall in kerala with a mm ginemascope screen to

through the red formica door that closed slowly on it own rahel followed ammu and baby kochamma into hers she turned to wave across the slipperoily marble floor at estha alone with a comb in his beige and pointy shoe estha waited in the dirty marble lobby with the lonely watching mirror till the red door took his sister away then he turned and padded off to his in hers ammu suggested that rahel balance in the air to piss she said that public pot were dirty like money wa you never knew who d touched it leper butcher car mechanic pu blood grease once when kochu maria took her to the butcher s shop rahel noticed that the green five rupee note that he gave them abhilash talkie had a tiny blob of red meat on it kochu maria wiped the blob away with her thumb the juice left a red smear she put the money into her bodice meat smelling blood money rahel wa too short to balance in the air above the pot so ammu and baby kochamma held her up her leg hooked over their arm her foot pigeon toed in bata sandal high in the air with her knickers down for a moment nothing happened and rahel looked up at her mother and baby grand aunt with naughty now what question mark in her eye come on ammu said

her baby grand aunt s enormous leg year later during a history lesson being read out in school the emperor babur had a wheatish complexion and pillar like thigh this scene would flash before her baby kochamma balanced like a big bird over a public pot blue vein like lumpy knitting running up her translucent shin fat knee dimpled hair on them poor little tiny foot to carry such a load baby kochamma waited for half of half a moment head thrust forward silly smile bosom swinging low melon in a blouse bottom up and out when the gurgling bubbling sound came she listened with her eye a yellow brook burbled through a mountain pas rahel liked all this holding the handbag everyone pissing in front of everyone like friend she knew nothing then of how precious a feeling this wa like jriends they

and didn t seem angry any more about velutha or the spit bubble that wa a good sign estha alone in his had to piss onto naphthalene ball and cigarette stub in the urinal to piss in the pot would be defeat to piss in the urinal he wa too short he needed height he searched for height and in a corner of his he found it a dirty broom a squash bottle half full of a milky liquid phenyl with floaty black thing in it a limp floorswab and two rusty tin can of nothing they could have been paradise pickle product pineapple chunk in syrup or slice pineapple slice his honour redeemed by his

put them back with the bottle and swab and broom he bowed to them all the whole shooting match the bottle the broom the can the limp fioorswab bow he said and smiled because when he w a younger he had

around magic flying carpet chacko wa in his room caught feasting roast chicken finger chip sweetcorn and chicken soup two parathas and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce sauce in a sauceboat chacko often said that his ambition wa to die of overeating mammachi said it wa a sure sign of suppressed unhappiness chacko said it wa no such thing he said it wa sheer greed chacko wa puzzled to see everybody back so early but pretended otherwise he kept eating the original plan had been that estha would sleep with chacko and rahel with ammu and baby kochamma but now that estha wasn t well and love had been reapportioned ammu loved her a litde less rahel would have to sleep with chacko and estha with ammu and baby kochamma ammu took rahel s pyjama and toothbrush out of the suit case and put them on the bed here ammu said two click to close the suitcase click and click ammu rahel said shall i miss dinner a my punishment she wa keen to exchange punishment no dinner in ex change for ammu loving her the same a before a you please ammu said but i advise you to eat if you want to grow that is maybe you could share some of chacko s chicken a b h i l a s h t a k i e s maybe and maybe not ghacko said but what about my punishment rahel said you haven t given me my punishment some thing come with their own punishment baby koch amnion said a though she wa explaining a sum that rahei couldn t understand some thing come with their own punishment like bed room with built in cupboard they would all learn more about punishment soon that they came in dilterent size that some were so big they were like cupboard w ith built in bedroom you could spend your whole life in them wandering through dark shelving baby kochamma s goodnight kiss left a little spit on rahel s cheek she wiped it off with her shoulder goodnight godbless ammu said but she said it with her back she wa already gone goodnight estha said too sick to love his sister rahel alone watched them walk down the hotel corridor like silent but substantial ghost two big one small in beige and pointy shoe the red carpet took ayay their foot sound rahel stood in the hotel room doorway full of sadness she had in her the sadness of sophie mol coming the sad ness of ammu s loving her a little less and the sadness of whatever the orangedrink lemondrink man had done to estha in abhilash talkie a stinging wind blew across her dry aching eye ghacko put a leg of chicken and some finger chip onto a quarter plate for rahel no thank you rahel said hoping that if she could somehow effect her own punishment ammu would rescind hers what about some ice cream with chocolate sauce ghacko said no thank you rahel said fine ghacko said but you don t know what you re missing the god of small thing he finished all the chicken and then all the ice cream rahel changed into her pyjama please don t tell me what it is you re being punished for chacko said i can t bear to hear about it he wa mopping the last of the chocolate sauce from the sauceboat with a piece of paratha his disgusting after sweet sweet avhat wa it scratching your mosquito bite till they bled not saying thankyou to the taxi driver something much worse than that rahel said loyal to ammu don t tell me chacko said i don t want to know he rang for room service and a tired bearer came to take away the plate and bone he tried to catch the dinner smell but they escaped and climbed into the limp brown hotel curtain a dinnerless niece and her dinnerfull uncle brushed their teeth together in the hotel sea queen bathroom she a forlorn stubby convict in striped pyjama and a fountain in a love in tokyo he in his cotton vest and underpants his vest taut and stretched over his round stomach like a second skin went slack over the depression of his belly button when rahel held her frothing toothbrush still and moved her teeth instead he didn t say she mustn t he wasn t a fascist they took it in turn to spit rahel carefully examined her white binaca froth a it dribbled down the side of the basin carefully to see what she could see what colour and strange creature had been ejected from the space between her teeth none tonight nothing unusual just binaca bubble chacko put off the big light in bed rahel took off her love in tokyo and put it by her sunglass her fountain slumped a litde but stayed standing ii ab hi lash talkie chacko lay in bed in the pool of light from his bedside lamp a fat man on a dark stage he reached over to his shirt lying crumpled at the foot of his bed he took his wallet out of the pocket and looked at the photogi aph of sophie mol that margaret kochamma had sent him two year ago rahel watched him and her cold moth spread it w ings again slow out slow in a predator s laz blink the sheet w ere coarse but clean chacko closed his w allet and put out the light into the night he lit a charminar and w ondered what his daughter looked like now nine year old last seen when she wa red and wrinkled barely human three w eeks later margaret his wife his only love had cried and told him about joe margaret told chacko that she couldn t live with him any more she told him that she needed her own space a though chacko had been using her shelf for his clothes which knowing him he probably had she asked him for a divorce those last few tortured night before he left her chacko w ould slip out of bed with a torch and look at his sleeping child to learn her imprint her on his memory to ensure that w hen he thought of her the child that he invoked would be accurate he memorized the brown down on her soft skull the shape of her puckered constandy movdng mouth the space between her toe the suggestion of a mole and then without meaning to he found himself searching his baby for sign of joe the baby clutched his index finger while he conducted his insane broken envious torchlit study her belly button protruded from her satiated satin stomach like a domed monument on a hill chacko laid his ear against it and listened with wonder at the rumbling from within message being sent from here to there new organ getting used to each other a new government setting up it system organizing the division of labour deciding who would do what the god of small thing she smelled of milk and urine chacko marv elled at how someone so small and undefined so vague in her resemblance could so completely command the attention the love the sanity of a grown man when he left he felt that something had been torn out of him something big but joe wa dead now killed in a car crash dead a a doorknob a joe shaped hole in the universe in chacko s photograph sophie mol wa seven year old white and blue rose lipped and syrian christian nowhere though mammachi peering at the photograph insisted she had pappachi s nose chacko rahel said from her darkened bed can i ask you a question ask me two chacko said chacko do you love sophie mol most in the world she s my daughter chacko said rahel considered this chacko is it necessary that people have to love their own child most in the world there are no rule chacko said but people usually do chacko for example rahel said just for example is it poss ible that ammu can love sophie mol more than me and estha or for you to love me more than sophie mol for example anything s possible in human nature chacko said in his reading aloud voice talking to the darkness now suddenly insensitive to his litde fountain haired niece love madness hope infinite joy of the four thing that were possible in human nature rahel thought that infinnate joy sounded the saddest perhaps because of the way chacko said it infinnate joy with a church sound to it like a sad fish with fin all over a cold moth lifted a cold leg ii a bh i lash talkie the cigarette smoke curled into the night and the fat man and the little girl lay awake in silence a few room away while his baby grand aunt snored estha awoke ammu wa asleep and looked beautiful in the barred blue streetlight that came in through the barred blue window she smiled a sleepsmile that dreamed of dolphin and a deep barred blue it wa a smile that gave no indication that the person who belonged to it wa a bomb waiting to go off estha alone walked weavily to the bathroom he omited a clear bitter lemony sparkling fizzy liquid the acrid aftertaste of a little man s first encounter with fear dum dum he felt a little better he put on his shoe and walked out of his room lace trailing down the corridor and stood quiedy outside rahel s door rahel stood on a chair and unlatched the door for him chacko didn t bother to wonder how she could possibly ha e known that estha wa at the dbor he wa used to their some time strangeness he lay like a beached whale on the narrow hotel bed and wondered idly if it had indeed been velutha that rahel saw he didn t think it likely velutha had too much going for him he wa a paravan with a future he wondered whether velutha had become a card holding member of the marxist party and whether he had been seeing comrade k n m pillai lately earlier in the year comrade pillai s political ambition had been given an unexpected boost two local party member comrade j kattukaran and comrade guhan menon had been expelled from the party a suspected naxalites one of them comrade guhan menon wa tipped to be the party s candi date for the kottayam by election to the legislative assembly due next march his expulsion from the party created a vacuum the god of small thing that a number of hopeful were jockeying to fill among them comrade k n m pillai comrade pillai had begun to watch the going on at paradise pickle with the keenness of a substitute at a soccer match to bring in a new labour union however small in what he hoped would be his future constituency would be an excellent begin ning for a journey to the legislative assembly until then at paradise pickle comrade comrade a ammu put it had been no more than a harmless game played outside working hour but if the stake were raised and the conductor s baton wrested from chacko s hand everybody except chacko knew that the factory already steeped in debt would be in trouble since thing were not going well financially the labour wa paid less than the minimum rate specified by the trade union of course it wa chacko himself who pointed this out to them and promised that a soon a thing picked up their wage would be revised he believed that they trusted him and knew that he had their best interest at heart but there wa someone who thought otherwise in the evening after the factory shift wa over comrade k n m pillai waylaid the worker of paradise pickle and shepherded them into his printing press in his reedy piping voice he urged them on to revolution in his speech he managed a clever mix of pertinent local issue and grand maoist rhetoric which sounded even grander in malayalam teople of the world he would chirrup be courageous dare to fight d difficulty and advance wave upon wave then the whole world will belong to the people monster of all kind shall be destroyed you must demand what is rightfully yours yearly bonus provident fund accident insurance since these speech were in part rehearsal for when a the local member of the legislative assembly comrade pillai would address thronging million there wa something odd about their pitch abhilash talkie and cadence his voice wa full of green rice field and red banner that arced across blue sky instead of a small hot room and the smell of printer s ink comrade k n m pillai never came out openly against chacko whenever he referred to him in his speech he wa careful to strip him of any human attribute and present him a an abstract functionary in some larger scheme a theoretical construct a pawn in the monstrous bourgeois plot to subx ert the revolution he never referred to him by name but aiwa s a the management a though chacko wa many people apart from it being tactically the right thing to do this disjunc tion between the man and his job helped comrade pillai to keep his conscience clear about his own private business dealing with chacko his contract for printing the paradise pickle label gave him an income that he badly needed he told himself that chacko the client and chacko the management were nvo different people quite separate of course from chacko the comrade the only snag in comrade k n m pillai s plan wa velu tha of all the worker at paradise pickle he wa the only card holding member of the party and that gave comrade pillai an ally he would rather have done without he knew that all the oth r touchable worker in the factory resented velutha for ancient reason of their own comrade pillai stepped care fully around this wrinkle waiting for a suitable opportunity to iron it out he stayed in constant touch with the worker he made it his business to know exaedy what went on at the factory he ridiculed them for accepting the wage they did w hen their own government the people s government wa in powder when punnachen the accountant who read mamniachi the paper every morning brought news that there had been talk among the worker of demanding a raise mamniachi wa f uri ous tell them to read the paper there s a famine on fhere the god of small thing are no job people are starving to death they should be grateful they have any work at alv whenever anything serious happened in the factory it wa always to mammachi and not chacko that the news wa brought perhaps this wa because mammachi fitted properly into the conventional scheme of thing she wa the modalali she played her part her response however harsh were straightforward and predictable chacko on the other hand though he wa the man of the house though he said my pickle jam my curry powder wa so busy trying on dif ferent costume that he blurred the batde line mammachi tried to caution chacko he heard her out but didn t really listen to what she wa saying so despite the early rumbling of discontent on the premise of paradise pickle chacko in rehearsal for the revolution continued to play comrade comrade that night on his narrow hotel bed he thought sleepily about pre empting comrade pillai by organizing his worker into a sort of private labour union he would hold election for them make them vote they could take turn at being elected representative he smiled at the idea of holding round table negotiation with comrade sumathi or better still comrade lucykutty who had much the nicer hair his thought returned to margaret kochamma and sophie mol fierce band of love tightened around his chest until he could barely breathe he lay awake and counted the hour for them to leave for the airport on the next bed his niece and nephew slept with their arm around each other a hot twin and a cold one he and she we and u somehow not wholly unaware of the hint of doom and all that waited in the wing for them they dreamed of their river of the coconut tree that bent into it and watched with abhilash talkie coconut eye the boat slide by upstream in the morning downstream in the evening and the dull sullen sound of tlie boatman s bamboo pole a they thudded against the dark oiled boatwood it wa warm the water greygreen like rippled silk with fish in it with the sky and tree in it and at night the broken yellow moon in it when they grew tired of waiting the dinner smell climbed off the curtain and drifted through the sea queen window s to dance the night away on the dinner smelling sea the time wa ten to tw o god s own country year later when rahel returned to the river it greeted her with a ghastly skull s smile with hole where teeth had been and a limp hand raised from a hospital bed both thing had happened it had shrunk and she had grown downriver a saltwater barrage had been built in exchange for vote from the influential paddy farmer lobby the barrage regulated the inflow of saltwater from the backwater that opened into the arabian sea so now they had two harvest a year instead of one more rice for the price of a river despite the fact that it wa june and raining the river wa no more than a swollen drain now a thin ribbon of thick water that lapped wearily at the mud bank on either side sequinned with the occasional silver slant of a dead fish it wa choked with a succulent weed whose flirred brown root waved like thin tentacle under water bronze winged lily trotter walked across it splay footed cautious once it had had the power to evoke fear to change life but now it teeth were drawn it spirit spent it wa just a slow sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid garbage to the sea bright plastic bag blew across it viscous weedy surface like subtropical flying flower the stone step that had once led bather right down to the water and fisher people to the fish were entirely exposed god s own country and led from nowhere to nowhere like an absurd corbelled monument that commemorated nothing fern pushed through the crack on the other side of the river the steep mud bank changed abruptly into low mud wall of shanty hutment child hung their bottom over the edge and defecated directly onto the squelchy sucking mud of the exposed river bed the smaller one left their dribbling mustard streak to find their own way down eventually by evening the river would rouse itself to accept the day s offering and sludge off to the sea leaving wavy line of thick white scum in it wake upstream clean mother washed clothes and pot in unadulterated factory effluent people bathed severed torso soaping themselv e arranged like dark bust on a thin rocking ribbon lawn on warm day the smell of shit lifted off the river and hovered over ayemenem like a hat further inland and still across a five star hotel chain had bought the heart of darkness the history house where map breath d ancestor with tough toe nail once whispered could no longer be approached from the river it had turned it back on ayemenem the hotel guest were ferried across the backwater straight from cochin they arrived by speedboat opening up a v of foam on the water leaving behind a rainbow film of gasoline the view from the hotel wa beautiful but here too the water wa thick and toxic no swimming sign had been put up in stylish calligraphy they had built a tall wall to screen off the slum and prevent it from encroaching on kari saipu s estate there wasn t much they could do about the smell but they had a swimming pool for swimming and fresh tandoori pomfret and crepe suzette on their menu the tree were still green the sky still blue v hich counted for something so they went ahead and plugged their smelly paradise god s own country they called it in their brochure the god of small thing because they knew those clever hotel people that smelliness like other people s poverty wa merely a matter of getting used to a question of discipline of rigour and air conditioning nothing more kari saipu s house had been renovated and painted it had become the centrepiece of an elaborate complex crisscrossed with artificial canal and connecting bridge small boat bobbed in the water the old colonial bungalow with it deep verandah and doric column wa surrounded by smaller older wooden house ancestral home that the hotel chain had bought from old family and transplanted in the heart of darkness toy history for rich tourist to play in like the sheaf of rice in joseph s dream like a press of eager native petitioning an english magistrate the old house had been arranged around the history house in attitude of deference heritage the hotel wa called the hotel people liked to tell their guest that the oldest of the wooden house with it air tight panelled storeroom which could hold enough rice to feed an army for a yeafr had been the ancestral home of comrade e m s namboodiripad ker ala s mao tse tung they explained to the uninitiated the furniture and knick knack that came with the house were on display a reed umbrella a wicker couch a wooden dowry box they were labelled with edifying placard which said traditional kerala umbrella and traditional bridal downy box so there it wa then history and literature enlisted by com merce kurtz and karl marx joining palm to greet rich guest a they stepped off the boat comrade namboodiripad s house functioned a the hotel s dining room where semi suntanned tourist in bathing suit sipped tender coconut water served in the shell and old com munists who now worked a fawning bearer in colourful ethnic clothes stooped slightly behind their tray of drink god s own country in the evening for that regional fla our the tourist were treated to truncated kathakali performance small attention span the hotel people explained to the dancer so ancient story were collapsed and amputated six hour classic were slashed to twenty minute cameo the performance were staged by the swimming pool while the drummer drummed and the dancer danced hotel guest frolicked with their child in the water while kunti revealed her secret to kama on the river bank courting couple rubbed suntan oil on each other while father played sublimated sexual game with their nubile teenaged daughter poothana suckled young krishna at her poisoned breast bhima disembowelled dushasana and bathed draupadi s hair in his blood the back verandah of the history house where a posse of touchable policeman converged where an inflatable goose wa burst had been enclosed and converted into the air hotel kitchen nothing worse than kebab and caramel custard hap pened there now the terror wa past overcome by the smell of food silenced by the humming of cook the cheerful chop chop chopping of ginger and garlic the disembowelling of lesser mammal pig goat the dicing of meat the scaling of fish something lay buried in the ground under grass under twenty three year of june rain a small forgotten thing nothing that the world would miss a child s plastic wristwatch with the time painted on it ten to two it said a band of child followed rahel on her walk hello hippie they said twenty five year too late whatis youmame then someone threw a small stone at her and her childhood fled flailing it thin arm the god of small thing on her way back looping around the ayemenem house rahel emerged onto the main road here too house had mush roomed and it wa only the fact that they nestled under tree and that the narrow path that branched off the main road and led to them were not motorable that gave ayemenem the semblance of rural quietness in truth it population had swelled to the size of a litde town behind the fragile facade of greenery lived a press of people who could gather at a moment s notice to beat to death a careless bus driver to smash the windscreen of a car that dared to venture out on the day of an opposition bandh to steal baby kochamma s imported insulin and her cream bun that came all the way from bestbakery in kottayam outside lucky press comrade k n m pillai wa standing at his boundary wall talking to a man on the other side comrade pillai s arm were crossed over his chest and he clasped his own armpit possessively a though someone had asked to borrow them and he had just refused the man across the wall shuffled through a bunch of photograph in a plastic sachet with an air of contrived interest the photograph were mostly picture of comrade k n m pillai s son lenin who lived and worked in delhi he took care of the painting plumbing and any electrical work for the dutch and german embassy in order to auay any fear his client might have about his politica l lean ings he had altered his name slighdy levin he called himself now p levin rahel tried to walk past unnoticed it wa absurd of her to have imagined that she could rahel mol comrade k n m pillai said recognizing her instantly orkunnill comrade uncle oowety rahel said did she remember him she did indeed neither question nor answer wa meant a anything more than a polite preamble to conversation both she and he knew that there are thing that can be forgotten and thing that god s o v x c o u n t r can not that sit on dusty shelf like stuffed bird with baleful sideways staring eye so comrade pillai said i think so you are in amavrica now no rahel said i m here yes yes he sounded a little impatient but otherwise in amayrica i suppose comrade pillai uncrossed his arm his nipple peeped at rahel over the top of the boundary wall like a sad st bernard s eye recognized comrade pillai asked the man with the photo graph indicating rahel with his chin the man hadn t the old paradise pickle kochamma s daughter s daughter comrade pillai said the man looked puzzled he wa clearly a stranger and not a pickle eater comrade pillai tried a different tack punnyan kunju he asked the patriarch of antioch appeared briefly in the sky and waved his withered hand thing began to fall into place for the man with the photo graph he nodded enthusiastically punnyan kunju s son benaan john ipe who used to be in delhi comrade pillai said oower oower oower the man said his daughter s daughter is this in amaytica now the nodder nodded a rahel s ancestral lineage fell into place for him oower oower oower in amayrica now isn t it it wasn t a question it wa sheer admiration he remembered vaguely a whiff of scandal he had forgotten the detail but remembered that it had involved sex and death it had been in the paper after a brief silence and another series of small nod the man handed comrade pillai the sachet of photograph the god of small thing okaythen comrade fll be off he had a bus to catch so comrade pillai s smile broadened a he turned all his attention like a searchlight on rahel his gum were startlingly pink the reward for a lifetime s uncompromising vegetarianism he wa the kind of man whom it wa hard to imagine had once been a boy or a baby he looked a though he had been bom middle aged with a receding hairline mol s husband he wanted to know hasn t come any photo no name larry lawrence oower lawrence comrade pillai nodded a though he agreed with it a though given a choice it wa the very one he would have picked any issue no rahel said still in planning stage i suppose or expecting no one is must boy girl anyone comrade pillai said two is of course your choice we re divorced rahel hoped to shock him into silence die vorced his voice rose to such a high register that it cracked on the question mark he even pronounced the word a though it were a form of death that is most unfortunate he said when he had recovered for some reason resorting to uncharacteristic bookish language mo stunfortunate it occurred to comrade pillai that this generation wa perhaps paying for it forefather bourgeois decadence one wa mad the other die vorced probably barren god s own country perhaps this wa the real revolution the christian bour geoisie had begun to self destruct comrade pillai lowered his voice a though there were people listening though there wa no one about and mon he whispered confidentially how is he fine rahel said he s fine fine flat and honey coloured he wash his clothes with crumbling soap aiyyo paavam comrade pillai whispered and his nipple drooped in mock dismay poor fellow rahel wondered what he gained by questioning her so closely and then completely disregarding her answer clearly he didn t expect the truth from her but why didn t he at least bother to pretend otherwise lenin is in delhi now comrade pillai came out with it finally unable to hide his pride working with foreign em bassies see he handed rahel the cellophane sachet they were mosdy photograph of lenin and his family his wife his child his new bajaj scooter there wa one of lenin shaking hand with a very well dressed very pink man german first secretary comrade pillai said they looked cheerful in the photograph lenin and his wife a though they had a new refrigerator in their drawing room and a down payment on a dda fiat rahel remembered the incident that made lenin swim into focus a a real person for her and estha when they stopped regarding him a just another pleat in his mother s sari she and estha were five lenin perhaps three or four year old they met in the clinic of dr verghese verghese kottayam s leading paediatrician and feeler up of mother rahel wa with ammu and estha who had insisted that he go along lenin wa with his mother kalyani both rahel and lenin had the the god of small thing same complaint foreign object lodged up their nose it seemed an extraordinary coincidence now but somehow hadn t then it wa curious how politics lurked even in what child chose to stuff up their nose she the granddaughter of an imperial entomologist he the son of a grass root marxist party worker so she a glass bead and he a green gi am the waiting room wa full from behind the doctor s curtain sinister voice murmured interrupted by howl from savaged child there wa a clink of glass on metal and the whisper and bubble of boiling water a boy played with the wooden doctor is im doctor is out sign on the wall sliding the brass panel up and down a feverish baby hiccupped on it mother s breast the slow ceiling fan sliced the thick frightened air into an unending spiral that spun slowly to the floor like the peeled skin of an endless potato no one read the magazine from below the scanty curtain that wa stretched across the doorway that led directly onto the street came the relentless slip slap of disembodied foot in slipper the noisy carefree world of those with nothing up their nose ammu and kalyani exchanged child nose were pushed up head bent back and turned towards the light to see if one mother could see what the other had missed when that didn t work lenin dressed like a taxi yellow shirt black stretchlon short regained his mother s nylon lap and his packet of chic let he sat on sari flower and from that unassailable position of strength surveyed the scene impassively he inserted his left forefinger deep into his unoccupied nostril and breathed noisily through his mouth he had a neat side parting his hair wa slicked down with ayurvedic oil the chiclets were his to hold before the doctor saw him and to consume after all wa well with the world perhaps he wa a little too young to know that atmosphere in waiting room plus scream from behind cur tain ought logically to add up to a healthy fear of dr v v god s own a o v s t r a rat with bristly shoulder made several busy journey between the doctor s room and the bottom of the cupboard in the waiting room a nurse appeared and disappeared thrcjugh the lattered curtained doctor s door she wielded strange weapon a tiny vial a rectangle of glass with blood smeared on it a test tube of sparkling back lit urine a stainless steel tray of boiled needle the hair on her leg were pressed like coiled wire against her translucent white stocking the box heel of her scuffed white sandal were worn away on the inside and caused her foot to slope in towards each other shiny black haii pin like straightened snake clamped her starched nurse s cap to her oily head she appeared to have rat filter on her glass she didn t seem to notice the bristly shouldered rat even when it scuttled right past her foot she called out name in a deep voice like a man s a ninan s kusumalatha b roshini n ambady she ignored the alarmed spiralling air estha s eye were frightened saucer he wa mesmerized by the doctor is in doctor is out sign a tide of panic rose in rahel ammu once again let s try ammu held the back of rahel s head w ith one hand with her thumb in her handkerchief she blocked the beadless nostril all eye in the w aiting room w ere on rahel it w a to be the perform ance of her life estha s expression prepared to blow it nose furrow gathered on his forehead and he took a deep breath rahel summoned all her strength please god please make it come out from the sol of her foot from the bottom of her heart she blew into her mother s handkerchief and in a rush of snot and relief it emerged a little mauve bead in a glistening bed of slime a proud a a pearl in an oyster child gathered around to admire it the boy that wa playing wdth the sign wa scornful the god of small thing i could easily do that he announced try it and see what a slap you ll get his mother said miss rahell the nurse shouted and looked around it s out i mmu said to the nurse it s come out she held up her crumpled handkerchief the nurse had no idea what she meant it s all right we re leaving ammu said the bead s out next the nurse said and closed her eye behind her rat filter it take all kind she told herself s v s kurup the scornful boy set up a howl a his mother pushed him into the doctor s room rahel and estha left the clinic triumphantly little lenin remained behind to have his nostril probed by dr verghese verghese s cold steel implement and his mother probed by other softer one that wa lenin then now he had a house and a bajaj scooter a wife and an issue rahel handed comrade pillai back the sachet of photograph and tried to leave one mint comrade pillai said he wa like a flasher in a hedge enticing people with his nipple and then forcing picture of his son on them he flipped through the pack of photograph a pictorial guide to lenin s life in a minute to the last one orkunnundo it wa an old black and white picture one that chacko took with the roueiflex camera that margaret kochamma had brought him a a christmas present all four of them were in it lenin estha sophie mol and herself standing in the front verandah of the ayemenem house behind them baby koch amma s christmas trimming hung in loop from

drinking only from a thimble she held out a lit candle in each hand one leg of her denim bellbottoms wa rolled up to expose a white bony knee on which a face had been drawn minute before that picture wa taken she had finished explaining patiendy to estha and rahel arguing away any e idence to the contrary photograph memory how there wa a pretw good chance that they were bastard and what bastard

younger year with prescience and good management mammachi had collected all her falling hair in a small embroid ered purse that she kept on her dressing table when there wa enough of it slie made it into a netted bun which she kept hidden in a locker with her jewellery a few year earlier when her hair began to thin and silver to give it body she wore her jet black bun pinned to her small silver head in her book this wa perfectly acceptable since all the hair wa hers at night when she took off her bun she allowed her grandchild to plait her remaining hair into a tight oiled grey rat s tail with a itibber band at the end one plaited her hair while the other counted her uncountable mole they took turn on her scalp carefully hidden by her scanty hair mammachi had raised crescent shaped

first thing she would touch in the morning when she woke up she had gone to bed early that night but woke a little after midnight she groped for them and her anxious finger came away with a film of oil the pickle bottle stood in a pool of oil there wa oil everywhere in a ring under her vacuum flask under her bible all over her bedside table the pickled mango had absorbed oil and expanded making the botdes leak mammachi consulted the book that chacko bought lier hamescate presermtions but it ofiered no solution then she dic tated a letter to annamma ghandy s brothcr in law who wa the regional manager of padma pickle in bombay he sug gested that she increase the proportion of preservative that she used and ilie salt that had helped but didn t solve the prob lem entirely even now after all those year paradise pickle bottle still leaked a little it wa imperceptible but they did still leak and on long journey their label became oily and transparent the pickle themselves continued to be a little on the salty side mammachi wondered whether she would ever master the an of perfect preservation and whether sophie mol would like some iced grape crush some cold purple juice in a g as then she thought of margaret kochamma and the languid liquid note of handel s music grew shnll and angry mammachi had never met margaret kochamma but she despised her anyway i opkeeper s ddughter wa how

kochamma for being chacko wife she hated her for leaving him but would have hated her even more had she stayed the day that chacko prevented pappachi from beating her and pappachi had murdered his chair instead mammachi packed her wifely luggage and committed it to chacko s care from then onvvai d he became the repository of all her womanly feeling her man her only love she wa awatc of his libertine relationship with the woman in the factory but had ceased to be hurt by them when baby kochamma brought up the sulyect mammachi became tense and tight lipped he can t help having a man s need she said pnmly surpnsmg y baby kochamma accepted this explanation and the enigmatic secretly thrilling notion of men s need gained implicit sanction in the aycmenem house neither mammachi nor baby kochamma saw any contradiction between ghacko s marxist mind and feudal libido they only worried about the naxdlitcs who had been known to force men from good family to marry servant girl whom they had made pregnant or course they did not even remotely suspect that the missile when it wa fired the one that would annihilate the family s good name for ever would come from a completely unexpected quarter welcome home our sophil moe mammachi had a separate entrance bink foi chacko s room which wa at the castein end of the housc so that the objecu of his need wouldn t have to go traipsing through the house she secredy slipped them money to keep them happy i licy took it because they needed it they had young child and old parent or husband who spent all their earnings in toddy bar the arrangement suited mammachi because in her mind a fee clarified thing disjuncted sex from love need fioin feeling margaret kochamma however wa a different ketde of fish altogether since she had no mean of finding out though she did once try to get kochu maria to examine die bedsheets for stain mammachi could only hope that margaret kochamma wa not intending to resume her sexual relationsliip with chacko while margaret kochamma wa in ayemcnem mam machi managed her otherwise unmanageable feeling by slip ping money into the pocket of the dress that mai gaict kochamma left in the laundry bin margaret kochamma never returned the money simply because she never found it her pocket were emptied a a matter of routine by aniyan the dhobi mammachi knew this but preferred to construe mai garet kochamma s silence a a tacit acceptance of payment for the favour mammachi imagined slic bestowed on her son so mammachi had the satisfaction of regarding mai ret kochamma a just another whore aniyan the dhobi wa happy with his daily gratuity and of course margaret kochamma remained blissfully unaware of die wliole arrangement from it percli on the well an untidy coucal called ffwaop and shuffled it rust red wing a crow stole some soap that bubbled in it beak in the dark smoky kitchen short kochu maria stood on her toe and iced the tall double deckered welcome home oor

insisted she wear inside the house she had shoit thick forearm finger like cocktail sausage and a broad fleshy nose with flared nostnjs deep fold of skin connected her nose to either side of her chin and separated that section of her face from the rest of it like a snout her head wa too large for her body she looked like a bottled foetus that had escaped from it jar of formaldehyde in a biology

prepared to believe that ned armstrong might conceivably even be some absurd kind of name but the waking on the moon bit no sir nor did she trust the vague grey picture that had appeared in the

and went to him ammu saw her go off stage she watched them perform their elaborate oflicial greeting velutha curtsied a he had been taught to his mundii spread like a skirt like the english dairymaid in the hinge breafkast rahel bowed and said bow then they hooked little finger and shook hand gravely with the mien of banker at a convention in the dappled sunlight filtering through the dark green tree ammu watched velutha lift her daughter effortlessly a llioug h she wa an inflatable child made of air a he tossed her up and she landed in his arm ammu saw on rahefs face the high delight of the airborne young she saw the ridge of muscle on ve ulha s stomach grow caught and rae under his skin like the division on a slab of chocolate she wondered at how his body had changed so quietly from a flatmuscled boy s body into a man s body con toured and hard a swimmer s body a swimmer carpenter s body polished with a high wax body polish he had high cheekbone and a white sudden smile it wa his smile that reminded ammu of velutha a a little boy helping vellya paapen to count coconut holding out little gift he had made for her flat on the palm of hia hand so that she could take them without touching him boat box small windmius galling her ammukutty little ammu tliough she wa so much less little than he wa when she looked at him now she couldn t help thinking that the man he had become

slic didn t allow heraelf to consider whom it wa that she cnviecl i he man or her own child or just their woild of hooked finger and sudden smile the man standing m the shade of the rubber tree with coin of sunshine dancing on his body holding her daughter in his amis glanced up and cauglit ammu s gaze centuncs tele scoped into one evanescent moment history wa wrong footed caught off guard sloughed off like an old snakeskin it mark it scar it wound from old war and the walking backwards day all fell away in it absence it left an aura a palpable shiminering that wa a plain to see a the water in a river or the sun in the sky a plain to feel a the heat on a hot day or the tug of a fish on a taut line so obvious that no one noticed in that brief moment velutha looked up and saw thing that he hadn t seen before thing that had been out of bound so far obscured by lustory s blinker simple thing for instance he saw that rahefs mother wa a woman that she had deep dimple when she smiled and that they stayed on long aftei her smile left her eye he saw that her brown arm were round and firm and perfect that her shoul ders shone but her eye were somewhere else he saw that when he gave her gift they no longer needed to be offered flat on the palm of his hand so that she wouldn t have to touch him his boat and box his little windmill he saw too that welcome mc our soimiil moi he wa not necessarily the only giver of gift that she had gift to give him too this knowing slid mio him deanlyj like the shaip edge of a knife gold and hot at once it only took a moment ammu saw that he saw she looked away he did too his tory s fiend returned to claim them to rewrap them in it old scarred pelt and drag them back to where they really lived where the love law lay down who should be loved and how and how much ammu walked up to the verandah back into the play shaking velutha looked down at ambassador insect in his arm he put her down shaking too and look at youv he said looking at

the same corner of the room that he lay in now she had died a cougliing spitting aching phlegmy death kuttappen remembered noticing how her foot died long before she had how the skin on them gre v grey and lifeless how fearfully he watched death creqj over her li om the bottom up kuttappen kept vigil on his own numb foot with mounting terror occasion ally he poked at them hopefully with a stick that he kept propped up in the comer to defend himself against visiting snake he had no sensation in his foot at all and only visual evidence assured him that they were still connected to his body and were indeed his own after chella died he wa moved into her corner the corner that kuttappen imagined wa the comer of his home that death had reserved to administer her deathly affair one comer for

deliberately squeezing the breath out ofhim and making him scream some time they receded of their own accord and the room he lay in grew impossibly large teironzing him witli the spectre of his own

he have swum on land in matching knickers and dark glass with his fountain in a love in tokyo in pointy shoe euid a puff would he have had the imagination velutha returned to see if kuttappen needed

concentration that excluded everything else boat dust flew around the room and settled on hair and eyebrow on kuttappen like a cloud on jesus like an offering velutha had to prise the sandpaper out of their finger not here he said firmly outside he picked the boat up and earned it out the twin followed eye fixed on their boat with unwavering concentration starving puppy expecting to be fed velutha set the boat up for them the boat that estha sat on and rahel found he showed them how to follow the grain of the wood he started them off on the sandpapering when he returned indoors the black hen

just another one of them he couldn t sfie had deep dimple udien she smiled her were always somewhere else madness slunk in tlirough a chink in history it only took a moment an hour into the sandpapering rahel remembered her after noon gnap and she wa up and running tumbling through the green afternoon heat followed by her brother and a yellow wasp hoping praying that ammu hadn t woken up and found her gone the god of small thing that afternoon ammu travelled upwards through a dream in which a cheerful man with one ann held her close by the light of an oil lamp he had no othei arm with which to fight the shadow that flickeied around him on the floor shadow that only he could see ridge of muscle on his stomach rose under his skin like division on a slab of chocolate he held her close by the light of an oil lamp and he shone a though he had been polished with a high ii ax body polish he could do only one thing at a dme if he held her he couldn t kiss her if he kissed her he couldn t sec her if he saw her he couldn t feel her she could have touched his body lightly with her finger and felt his smooth skin turn to gposeflesh she could have let her finger stray to die base of his flat stomach carelessly over those burnished chocolate ridge and jea patterned trail of bumpy gooseflesh on his body like flat chalk on a blackboard like a swathe of breeze in a paddyfield like jet streak in a blue church sky she could so easily have done that but she didn t he could have touched her too but he didn t because in the gloom beyond the oil lamp in tlie shadow there were metal folding chair arranged in a ring and on the chair there were people with slanting rhinestone sunglass watching they all the ood or small thing held polished violin under their chin the bow poised at identi cal angle they all had their leg crossed left over right and all their left leg were shivering some of them had newspaper some didn t some of them blew spit bubble some didn t but they all had the bickering reflection of an oil lamp on each lens beyond the circle of folding chair wa a beach littered with broken blue glass botdes the silent wave brought new blue bottle to be broken and dragged the old one away in the undertow there were jagged sound of glass on glass on a rock out at sea in a shaft of purple light there wa a mahogany and wicker rocking chair smashed the sea wa black the spume vomit green fish fed on shattered glass night s elbow rested on the water and falling star glanced off it brittle shard moth ht up the sky there wasn t a moon he could swim with his one arm she with her two his skin wa salty hers too he left no footprint in sand no npples m water no image in mirror she could have touched him with her finger but she didn t they just stood together sdu skin to skin a powdery coloured breeze lifted her hair and blew it like a rippled shawl around his armless shoulder that ended abruptly like a cliff a thin red cow with a protruding pelvic bone appeared and sfwam straight out to sea without wetting her horn without looking back the god of small iiiings ammu flew through her dream oi heavy shuddering wing and stopped to rest just undci the skin of it she had piessed rose from the blue cross stitch counterpane on her cheek she sensed her child s face hanging over her dream like two dark worried moon waiting to be let in d you think she s dymg she heard rahel whisper to estha it s an afternoon mare estha the accuiate replied she dream a lot if he touched her he couldnh talk to her if he loifed her he couldn i mw if he spoke he couldn t itsletiy he fought he couldn i win who wa he the one armed man who could he have been the god of loss the god of small thing the god of goose bump and sudden smile of sourmetal smell like steel bus rail and the smell of the bus conductor s hand from holding them should we wake her up estha said chink of late afternoon light stole into the room through the curtain and fell on ammu s tangerine shaped transistor radio that she always took with her to the river tangerine shaped too wa the thing that estha carried into the sound of mustc in his sticky other hand bright bar of sunlight brightened ammu s tangled hair she waited under the skin of her dream not wanting to let her childi en in she say you should never wake dreaming people suddenly rahel said she say they could easily have a heart attack between them they decided dial it would be best to disturb her discreetly rather than wake her suddenly so they opened drawer they cleared their throat they whispered loudly they liumnied a little tune they moved shoe and found a cupboard door that creaked thi god of small thing animu resting undei the skin of her dream observed them and ached with her love foi them fhe one armed man blew out his lamp and walked across the jagged bcacli away into the shadow that only he could see he left no footpnnts on the shore the folding chair were folded the black sea smoothed the creased wave ironed the spume rcbottled the botde corked the night postponed till further notice ammu opened hei eye it wa a long journey that she made from the embrace of the one armed man to her unidcntical two egg twin you were having an aftemoon mare her daughter informed her it wasn t a mare ammu said it wa a dream estha thought you were dying you looked so sad estha said i wa happy ammu said and realized that she had been if you re happy in a dream ammu doe that count estha asked doe what count the happiness doe it count she knew exactly what he meant her son with his spoiled puff because the truth is that only what count count the simple unswerving wisdom of child if you eat fish in a dream doe it count doe it mean you ve eaten fish the cheerful man without footprint did he count ammu groped for her tangerine transistor and switched it on it played a song from a film called otemmem it wa the story of a poor girl who is forced to many a fisherman from a neighbouring beach though she love some one else when che fisherman find out about his new wife s old i hi god oi small thing lover he set out to sca in his hulc boat though he know that a storm is brewing il s dark and

them all in the blue cross stitch darkness laced with edge of light with cross stitch rose on her sleepy cheek atnmu and her t vins one on either side of her sang softly with the tangerine radio the

nearby tree to supervise the super vision of the last iites of the dead elephant they hoped not without leasoii for picking of giant innards an enormous gall bladder perhaps or a charred gigantic spleen they weren t disappointed nor wholly satisfied ammu noticed that both her child were covered in a fine dust like two piece of lightly sugar dusted umdentical cake rahel had a blonde curl lodged among her black one a curl from velutha s backyard ammu picked it out i ve told you before she said i don t want you going to his house it will only cause trouble what trouble she didn t say she didn t know somehow by not mentioning his name she knew that she had drawn him into the tousled intimacy of that blue cross stitch afternoon and the song from the tangerine transistor by not mentioning his name she sensed that a pact had been forged between her dream and the world and that the midwife of that pact were or would be her sawdust coated two egg twin she knew who he wa the god of loss the god of small thing of mwrse she did she switched off the tangerine radio in the afternoon silence ciaced with edge of light her child curled into the warmth of her the smell of her they covered their head with her qso the ood or small tlflnos hain they sensed somehow that tn her sleep she had travelled away fiom them they summoned her back now mth ihc palm of chcir small hand laid flat against the bare skin of her midrifl between her petticoat and her blouse they loved the fact that the brown of the back of their hand wa the exact brown of their mother s stomach skin estha look rahel said plucking at the line of soft down that led southward from ammu s bellybutton here s where we kicked you estha traced a wandering silver stretchmaik with his finger wa it m the bus ammu on the winding estate load when baba had to hold your tummy did you have to buy ticket did we hurt you and then keeping her voice casual rahel s question d you think he may have lost our address just the hint of a pause in the rhythm of ammu s breathing made estha touch kahel s middle finger with his and middle finger to middle finger on their beautiful mother s midriff they abandoned that line of questioning that s estha s kick and that s mine rahel said and that s estha s and that s mine between them they apportioned their mother s seven silver stretchmarks then rahel put her mouth on ammu s stomach and sucked at it pulling the soft flesh into her mouth and drawing her head back to admire the shining oval of spit and the faint red imprint of her teeth on her mother s skin ammu wondered at the transparence of that kiss it wa a cleai a glass kiss unclouded by passion or desire that pair of dog that sleep so soundly inside child waiting for them to grow up it wa a kiss that demanded no kiss back not a cloudy kiss full of question that wanted answer like the kiss of cheerful one armed men in dream ihe god of small thing atnmii grew tired of their propnetaiy handling of her she wanted her body back it wa hers she shrugged her child oir the way a bitch shrug off her idups when she s had enough of them she sat up and twisted hei hair into a knot at the nape of her neck then she swung her leg off the bed walked to the window and drew back the curtain slanting anernoon light flooded the room and brightened two child on the bed the twin heard the lock turning in ammu s bathroom door click ammu looked at herself in the long mirror on the bathroom door and the spectre of her future appeared in it to mock her pickled grey rheumy eyed cross stitch rose on a slack sunken cheek withered breast that hung like weighted sock dry a a bone between her leg the hair feather white spare a brittle a a pressed fern skin that flaked and shed like snow ammu shivered with that cold feeling on a hot aflernoon that lafe had been lived that her cup wa full of dust that the air the sky the tree the sun the rain the light and darkness were all slowly turning to sand that sand would all her nostril her lung her mouth would pull her down leaving on the surface a spinning swirl like crab leave when they burrow downwards on a beach ammu undressed and put a red toothbrush under a breast tq see if it would stay it didn t where she touched herself her flesh wa taut and smooth under her hand her nipple wrinkled and hardened like dark nut pulling at the soft skin on her breast the thin line of down from her belly button led over the gentle curve of the base of her belly to her dark tnangle like an arrow directing a lost traveller an inexperienced lover she undid her hair and turned around to see how long it had grown it fell in wave and curl and disobedient frizzy wisp soft on the inside coarser on the outside to just below nie or small tiiinos where her small strong waist began it cm r out towards hci hip the bathroom wa hot small bead of sweat studded her skin like diamond then they broke and trickled down sweat ran down the recessed line of her spine she looked a hule critically at her round heavy behind not big m itself not big per se a chacko of oxford would no doubt have put it btg only because the rest of her wa slender it belonged on another more voluptuous body she had to admit that they would happily support a tooth brush apiece perhaps two she laughed out loud at the idea of walking naked down ayemenem with an array of coloured toothbrush sticking out from either cheek of her bottom she silenced herself quickly she saw a wisp of madness escape from it bottle and caper tnumphantly aiound the bathroom ammu worried about madness mammachi said it ran in their family that it came on people suddenly and caught them unawaies there wa fathil ammai who at the age of sixty five began to take her clothes off and run naked along the river singing to the fish there wa tharapi chachen who searched his shit every morning with a knitting needle for a gold tooth lie had swallowed year ago and dr muthachen who had to be removed from his own wedding in a sack would future generation say tthere wa ammu ammu ipe married a bengali went quite mad died young in a cheap lodge somewhere chacko said that the high incidence of insanity among syrian christian wa the price they paid for inbreeding mammachi said it wasn t ammu gathered up her heavy hair wrapped it around her face and peered down the road to age and death through it parted strand like a medieval executioner peering through the tilted eye slit of his peaked black hood at the executionee a slender naked executioner with dark nipple and deep dimple when she smiled with seven silver stretchmarks from lift non ol sma thing her iwo cgg twin jjoi n to hei by candlelight aimdst news of a lost war it wasn t what lay at the end of her road that fnghtened ainniu a iniich a the natuie of the road itself no milestone maikcd it progress no tree grew along it no dappled shadow shaded it no mist rolled over it no bird circled it no twist no turn or hairpin bend obscured even momentarily her clear view of the end this filled ammu with an awful dread because she wa not the kind of woman who wanted her future told she dreaded it too much so if she were granted one small wish perhaps it would only have been not to know not to know what each day held in store for her t ofto know where she might be next month next year ten year on not to know which way her road might turn and what lay beyond the bend and ammu knew or thought she knew which wa really just a bad because if m a dream you ve eaten fish it mean you ve eaten fish and what ammu knew or thought she knew smelled of the vapid dnegary fume that rose from the cement vat of paradise pickle fume that wrinkled youth and pickled future hooded in her own hair ammu leaned against hei self in the bathroom mirror and tried to weep for herself for the god of small thmgs for the sugar dusted twin midwife of her dream that afternoon while in the bathroom the fate conspired to alter horribly the course of their mysterious mother s road while in velutha s backyard an old boat waited for themy while in a yellow church a young bat waited to be bom in their mother s bedroom estha stood on his head on

mother s kiss did you know how much missed you rahel could see it coursing through his vein a clearly a an egg travelling down an ostrich s neck a travelling kiss whose journey wa cut short by dismay when kama realized that his mother had revealed herself to him only to secuie the safety of her five other more beloved son the pandavas poised on the brink of their epic battle with their one bundled

performance like this separated by the breadth of the kuthamba am but joined by a story and the memory of another mother the air grew warmer less damp perhaps that evening had been a particularly bad one in the heart of darkness in ayemenem the men danced a though they couldn t stop like child in a warm house sheltering from a storm refusing to emerge and acknowledge tlie weather the wind and thunder the rat racing across the ruined land scape with dollar sign in their eye the world crashing around them they emerged from one story only to delve deep into another from kama shabadam kama s

kill him long aflet he wa dead then with his bare hand he tore tlie body open he ripped it innards out and stooped to lap blood straight from the bowl of the torn carcass his crazed eye peeping over

bloody mtesunes draped around his neck like a scarf and went to draupadi and batlie her ban in fresh blood he still had about him the aura of rage that even murder can not quell there wa madness there

still asleep she lay on her back with her hand clasped together just below her ribcage her anger were swollen and her wedding band looked uncomfortably tight the flesh of her cheek fell away on either side of her face making her cheekbone look high and promi nent and pulling her mouth downwards into a mirthless smile that contained just a glimmer of teeth she had tweezed her once bushy eyebrow into the currently fashionable pcncil thin arc which gave her a slighdy surprised expression even in her sleep the rest of her expression were growing back in a nascent stubble her face wa flushed her forehead glistened under neath the flush there wa a paleness a staved oft sadness the thin material of her dark blue and white flowered cotton polyester dress had wilted and clung limply to the contour of her body rising over her breast dipping along the line between her long strong leg a though it too wa unaccustomed to the heat and needed a nap on the bedside table there wa a silver framed black and white wedding picture of ghacko and margaret kochamma taken outside the church m oxford it wa snowing a little the first flake of fresh snow lay on the street and sidewalk chacko thk god of

triangle peeped out of his breast jiocket on his foot he wore polished black oxford he looked a though he wa laugh ing at hiinsclf and the way he wa dressed lake someone at a fancy dress party margaret kochamma wore a long foaming gown and a cheap tiara on her cropped curly hair her veil wa lifted off her face she wa a tall a he wa they looked happy thin and young scowling from the sun in their eye her thick daik eyebrow were knitted together and somehow made a lovely contrast to the frothy bndal white a scowling cloud with eye brow behind tliem stood a large matronly woman with thick ankle and all the button done up on her long overcoat margaret kochamma s mother she had her two little grand daughter on either side of her in pleated tartan skirt stocking and identical fringe they were both giggling with their hand over their mouth maigaret kochamma s mother wa looking away out of the photograph a though she would rather not have been there margaret kochamma s fatlier had refused to attend the wed ding he disliked indian he thought of them a sly dishonest people he couldn t believe that his daughter wa marrying one in the right hand comer of the photograph a man wheeling his bicycle along the kerb had turned to stare at the couple marg et kochamma wa working a a waitress at a caffe in oxford when she first met chacko her family lived in london her father owned a bakery her mother wa a milliner s assis tant margaret kochamma had moved out of her parent home a year agp for no greater reason than a youthful assertion of independence she intended to work and save enough money the ssi mist amd the optimist to put herself through a teacher training course and ilirn look for a job at a school in oxford she shared a small flat with a friend anothei waitress in another cafe having made the move margaret kochamma found herself becoming exactly die kind of girl her parent wanted her to be faced with the real world she clung ner iisly to old remembered rule and had no one but herself to rebel against so even up at oxford other than playing her gramophone a little louder than she wa permitted at home she continued to lead the same small tight life that she imagined she had escaped until chacko walked into the cafe one morning it wa the summer of his final year at oxford he wa alone his rumpled shirt wa buttoned up wrong his shoelace ivere untied his haic carefully brushed and slicked down in front stood up m a stiff halo of quill at the back he looked like an untidy beatified porcupine he wa tall and underneath the mess of clothes inappropriate tie shabby coat margaret koch amma could see that he wa well built he had an amused air about him and a way of narrowing his eye a though he wa trying to read a faraway sign and had forgotten to bring his glass his ear stuck out on either side of his head like teapot handle there wa something contradictory about his adiletic build and his dishevelled appearance the only sign that a fat man lurked inside him wa his shining happy check he had none of the vagueness or the apologetic awkwardness that one usually associate with untidy absent minded men he looked cheerful a though he wa with an imaginary friend whose company he enjoyed he took a seat by the window and sat down with an elbow on the table and his face cupped in the palm of his hand smiling around the empjty cak a though he wa considering striking up a conversadon with the furniture he ordered coffee with that same friendly smile but without really appearing to notice the tall bushy eyebrowed waitress who took his order non oe small iiiings she winced when he put two heaped spoon of sugar into his extremely milky coftee then he asked for fried egg on toast more cojlec and strawberry jam when she letuined with his order he said a though he wa continuing an old conversation have you heard about the man who had twin son no she said setting down hi breakfast for some reason natural prudence perhaps and an instinctive reticence with foreigner she did not evince the keen interest that he seemed to expect from her about the man with twin son chacko didn t seem to mind a man had twin son he told margaret kochamma pete and stuait pete wa an optimist and stuart wa a pessimist he picked the strawberry out of the jam and put them on one side of his plate the rest of the jam lie spread in a thick layer on his buttered toast on their thirteenth birthday their fauier gave stuart the pessimist an expensive watch a carpentry set and a bicycle chacko looked up at margaret koch mnia to sec if she w a listening and pete s the optimist s room he filled with hoise dung chacko lifted the fned egg onto the toast broke the brilliant wobbling yoke and spread them over the strawberry jam with the back of his teaspoon when stuart opened his present he grumbled all morning he hadn t wanted a carpentry set he didn t like the watch and the bicycle had the wrong kmd of tyre margaret kochamma had stopped listening because she wa riveted by the curious ntual unfolding on his plate the toast with jam and fried wa cut into neat htde square the dejammed strawberry were summoned one by one and sliced into delicate piece s tiir prssimis and iiir opiimisr when the falhei went to pete s the opumisi s room he couldn t sec pete but he coutd hear the sound of frantic sliovcl ling and heavy breathing horse dung wa flying all over the room ghacko had begun to shake with silent laughter in anticipa tion of the end of his joke with laughing hand he placed a sliver of strawberry on each bright yellow and red square of toast making the whole thing look like a lui id snack that an old woman mig it serve at a bridge party what in heaven s name are you domg the fatlici shouted to pete salt and pepper wa sprinkled on the square of toast ghacko paused before the punch line laughing up at maigai t koch amma who wa smiling at his plate a voice came from deep inside the dung well father pete said if there s so much sliit around there ha to be a pony somewherel ghacko holding a fork and a knife in each hand leaned back in his chair in the empty cak and laughed his high hiccupping mfectious fat man s laugh till the tear poured down his cheek margaret kochamma who had mhsed most of the joke smiled then she began to laugh at his laugh their laugh fed each other and climbed to a hysterical pitch when the owner of the cafi appeared he saw a customer not a particularly desirable one and a waitress an only averagely desirable one locked in a spiral of hooting helpless laughter meanwhile another customer a regular had arrived un noticed and waited to be served the owner cleaned some already ean glass clinking them together noisily and clattered crockery on the counter to convey his displeasure to maigaret kochamma she tried to compose herself before she went to take the new order but she had tear in her eye and had to stifle a fresh batch of giggle which made the hungry man whose order she wa taking look up from till i oe simal c ihinuh his mriiu card lius linn lip u scc iti silent lisapjsioval slic stole a glance at c haeko who looked at hci

truly sorry for tlic way siac jiad behaved thai evening after work she thought about what had hap pened and wa uncomfortable with herself she wa not usually involous and didn t think it right to have shared such uncon trolled laughter with a complete stranger it seemed such an over famihar intutiatc thing to have done she wondered what had made hei laugh so niucli she knew it wasn t the joke she thought of chacko s laugh and a smile stayed in liei eye tor a long umc chacko began to visit the ca quite often he always came witli his invisible companion and his friendly smile even when it wasn t margaret kochamma who served him he sought her out with his eye and they exchanged secret smile that invoked die joint memory of their laugh margaret kochamma found herself looking fbrwaid to the rumpled porcupine s visit without anxiety but with a aoit of creeping affection she learned tliat he wa a rhodes scholar from india that he read classic and rowed for balliol until the day she married him she never believed that she would ever consent to be his wife a few month after they began to go out together he began to smuggle her into his room where he lived like a helpless exiled prince despite the best effort of his scout and cleaning lady hia room wa always filthy book empty wine bottle dirty underwear and cigarette butt littered the floor cupboard were dangerous to open because clothes and book and shoe would cascade down and some of his book were heavy enough rnis i lssimisr and iiij jimimim to inflict rtial damage margaret kochamma s tiny oick ii d lilr relinquished iisejf

impossible incurable romantic who forgot the candle who bioke the wme glass wlio lost the ring who made love to liei with a passion that took her breath away she had always thought of iicrself a a somewhat uninteresting thick waisled thick aiiklecl girl not bad looking not special but when she wa with chacko old limit were pushed back horizon expanded she had never before met a man wlio spoke of the world of what it wa and how it came to be or what he thought would become of it r the way in which other men she knew discussed their job their friend or their weekend at the beach being with chacko made margaret kochamma feci a though hei soul had escaped from tlie nanow coniines of her island country into the vast extravagant space of his he made her feel a chough the world belonged co cheni a though it lay before them like an opened frog on a dissecting table begging to be examined in the year she knew him before they were married she discovered a iitde magic m herself and for a while fell like a blithe genie released from her lamp she wa erhaps too young to realize that what she assumed wa her love for chacko wa actually a tentative timorous acceptance of herself a for chacko margaret kochamma wa the first female friend he had ever had not just the first woman that he had dept with but his first real companion what chacko loved most about her wa her seif ufficiency perhaps it wasn t remaifeablc in the avci age english woman but it wa remarkable to chacko he loved the fact that margaret kochamma didn t cling to inm that she wa uncertain about her feejings for him

margaret kochamma foi not depending on him he adoied her for not adoiing him oi his family maigaret kochamma knew very little he seldom spoke of them the truth is that in his yeai s at oxford chacko rarely thought of them too much wa happening in his life and ayemcnein seemed so far away the river too small the fish too few he had no pressing reason to stay in touch with his parent the rhodes

amniu had said why can t you just go away and leave me alone so they had but when the only answer baby kochamma got to her ques tion about die childien wa something crashing against ammu s bedroom door she went away a slow dread built up inside her a she began to make the obvious logical and completely mistaken connection between the night s happening and the missing child the rain had started early the previous afternoon suddenly the hot day darkened and the sky began to clap and grumble kochu maria in a bad mood for no particular reason wa in the kitchen standing on her low stool savagely cleaning a laige fish working up a smelly blizzard offish scale her gold earring swung fiercely silver fish scale flew around the kitchen landing on ketdes wall vegetable peeler the fridge handle she ignored vellya paapen when he arrived at the kitchen door the god of small thing drenched and shaking his real eye wa bloodshot and he looked a though he had been drinking he stood there for tea minute waiting to be noticed when kochii maria finished the fish and started on the onion he cleared his throat and asked fot mamtnachi kochu maria tried to shoo him away but he wouldn t gp each time he opened his mouth to speak the smell of arrack on his breath hit kochu mana like a hammer slie had never seen him like this before and wa a little frightened she had a pretty good idea of what it wa all about so she eventually decided that it would be best to call manimachi she shut the kitchen door leaving vellya paapen outside in the back mittam weaving drunkenly in the driving lain though it wa december it laincd a though it wa june cyclonic disturbance the newspaper called it the next day but by then nobody wa in any condiuon to read the paper perhaps it wa the ram that drove vellya paapen to the kitchen door to a superstitious man the relentlessncss of that unseasonal downpour could have seemed like an omen from an angry god to a drunk superstitious man it could have seemed like the beginning of the end of the world which in a way it wa when mammachi arrived in the kitchen in her petticoat and pale pink dressing gown with rickrack edging vellya paapen climbed up the kitchen step and offered her his mortgaged eye he held it out in the palm of his hand he said he didn t deserve it and wanted her to have it back his left eyelid drooped over his empty socket in an immutable monstrous wink a though everything tlxat he w s about to say wa part of an elaborate prank what it mammachi asked stretching her hand out think ing perhaps that for some reason vellya paapen wa reluming the kilo of red nee she had given him that morning it s his eye kochu maria said loudly to mammachi hei own eye bright with onion tear by then mammaclii had ihf rcssimisl and tl i opl im is i

nothing when he stood on the topmost step almost inside her touchable kitchen diying hiniseli sheltered from the rain by the sloping overhang ol the rool when he wa calmer vellya paapen rctuincd lit eye to it rightful socket and began to speak he started by recounting to mammachi how much hei family had done for his generation for gcnciation how long before the communist thought ol it reverend e john ipe had given his fathei kclan title to the land on which their hut now stood how mammachi had paid for his eye how she had organised for velutha to be educated and given him a job mammachi though annoyed at his drunkenness wasn t averse to listening to bardic stone about herself and her family s christian munificence nothing prepaied her for what she wa about to hear vellya paapen began to cry half of him wept teai s welled up in his real eye and shone on his black cheek with his other eye he stared stonily ahead an old paravan who had seen the walking backwards day torn between loyally and love then the terror took hold of him and shook the word out of him he told mammachi wiiat he had seen the story of the little boat that crossed the river night after night and who wa in

vellya paapen had seen them with his own eye others had seen them too the whole village knew it wa only a matter of time before maniinachi found out so vellya paapen had come to tell mammachi himself

shouting suddenly the blind old woman in her iickracdc dressing gown and her thin grey hair plaited into a rat s tail stepped forward and pushed vellya paapen with all her strength he stumbled backwards down the kitchen step and lay sprawled in the wet mud he wei taken completely by suipnse part of the taboo of being an untouchable wa expecting not to be touched at least not in these

he wanted to use ghacko s visit to impress local supplicant and pai ly worker pothachen and matlmkutty the men he had sent for were villager who had asked him to use his connection at the kottayam hospital to secure nursing job for their daugh ters comrade pillai wa keen that they be seen watting outside his house for their appointment with him the more people chat were seen waiting co meet him tiie busier he svould appear the better the impression he would make and if the waiting people saw that the factory modalali himself had come to see him on it turf he knew it would give off all sort

pillai stored in his cm tamed cupboard it wasn t broken balsa airplane chacko on the other hand from the moment lie had entcied the house or pci hap from the moment comiade pillai had ariivcd had undergone a cuiious process of invakdanon like a general who had been stripped of his star he limited his smile contained his expansivencss anybody meeting him there for the first time might have thought him i rcircnc almost timid with a street fighter s unerring instinct comrade pillai knew that his straitened circumstance his small hot house his grunt ing mother his obvious proximity to the toiling mass gave him a power over chacko that in those revolutionary time no amount of oxford education could match he held his poverty like a gun to chacko s head chacko brought out a crumpled piece of paper on which he had tried to sketch the rough layout for a new label that he wanted comrade k n m pillai to print it wa foi a new pioduct that paradise pickle preserve planned to launch m the spring synthetic cooking vinegar drawing wa not one of ghacko s strength but comrade pillai got the general gist he wa familiar with the logo of the kathakah dancer the slogan under his skirt that said hmperors of the realm his idea and ihf tjod of smai i tiilncts the lyi clact ihcy had chosen or paradise pickle preaci vcs design is same only diflcrcncc is in text i suppose goin i adc pihai

day s march v a a success chacko said finally broacjnng the real reason for his visit unless and until demand aie met comrade wc can not say it is success or non success a pamphleteering inflection crept into comrade pillai s voice until then stiugglc must continue but response wa good chacko prompted tiying to speak in the same idiom that is of course there comrade pillai said comiades work is

suppose comrade pilkii said but according to party souices trivandrum response wsis mucji moie better there were thousand of comrade in cochin too charko said in fact my niece saw our young velutha among them oho i sec comrade pillai wa caught off guard velutha wa a topic he had planned to bioach with chacko some day eventually but not this straightforwardly his mind hummed like the table ian he wondeicd whether to make use of the opening that wa being offered to him or to leave it for another day he decided to use it now yes he is good woikcr he said thoughlfuuy highly iiicel hgent hc is chacko said an excellent carpemci with an engi neer s mind if a wasiih for not ihat woiker comrade comrade pillai said i ariv worker comrade pillai s mother continued to rock and grunt theie wa something reassuring about the rhythm of the grunt like the ticking of a clock a sound you hardly noticed but would miss if it stopped ah i see so he s a card holder oh yes comrade pillai said softly oh yes pei spiraiion uickled through chacko s hair he felt a though a company of ant wa touring his scalp he scratched his head foi a long lime with both his hand moving his whole scalp up and down os kaaiyam pamyattgfi comrade pillai switched to mdlayalam and a confiding conspiratorial voice t m speaking a a friend keio off the i ccord the god of small thing before he continued gonnrade filial studied chacko trying to gauge his response chacko wa examining the grey paste of sweat and dandruff lodged under his fingernail that paravan is going to cause trouble for you he said take it from me get him a job somewhere else send him off chacko wa puzzled at the turn the conversation had taken he had only intended to find out what wa happening where thing stood he had expected to encounter antagonism even confrontation and instead wa being offered sly misguided collusion send him away but why i have no objection to him being a card holder i wa just curious that s all i thought perhaps you had been speaking to him chacko said but i m sure he sju t experimenting testing his wing he s a sensible fellow comrade i trust him not like that comrade filial said he may be very well okay a a person but other worker are not happy with him already they are coming to me with complaint you see comrade from local standpoint these caste issue are very deep rooted kalyani put a steel tumbler of steaming coffee on the table for her husband see her for example mistress of this house even she will never allow paravans and all that into her house never even can not persuade her my own wife of course inside the house she is bos he turned to her with an affectionate naughty smile plalyani kalyani looked down and smiled coyly acknowledging her bigotry you see comrade pillai said triumphantly she undei stand english very well only doesn t speak chacko smiled half heartedly you say my worker arc coming to you with complaint wokk is stkugcfli oh yes correct comrdcle pillai said anything specific nothing specifically a such comiadc k n m pillai said but see comrade any benefit that you give him naturally others are resenting it they see it a a partiality after all whatever job he doe carpenter or electrician or whateventis for them he is just a paravan it is a conditioning they have from birth this i myself have told them is wrong but frankly speaking comrade change is one thing acceptance is another you should be cautious bettei for him you send him off my dear fellow chacko said that s impossible he s invaluable he practically run the factory and we can t solve the problem by sending all the paravans away surely we have to learn to deal with this nonsense comrade pillai disliked being addressed a my dear fellow it sounded to him like an insult couched in good english which of course made it a double insult the insult itself and the fact that chacko thought he wouldn t understand it it spoiled his mood completely that may be he said caustically but rome wa not built in a day keep it in mind comrade that this is not your oxford college for you what is a nonsense for mass it is something different lenin with his father s thinness and his mother s eye appeared at the door out of breath he had finished shouting the whole of mark antony s speech and most of lochinvar before he realized that he had lost his audience he reposiuoned himself between comrade pillai s parted knee he clapped his hand over his father s iiead creating mayhem in the mosquito funnel he counted the squashed carcass on his palm some of them bloated wth fresh blood he showed them to his father who handed him over to his mother to be cleaned up once again the silence between them wa appropriated by rtir j of small thing old mr pillai s giunts latha anived with pothachen and mathukulty the men were made to wait outside the door wa left ajai when comrade pillai spoke next he spoke in malayalam and made sure it wa loud enough for his audience outside or course the proper forum to air worker grievance is through die union and in this case when modalali himself is a comrade it is a shameful matter for them not to be unionized and join the party struggle i ve thought of that chacko said i am going to formally organize them into a union they will elect their own represen tatives but comrade you can not stage their revolution for them you can only create awareness educate them they must launch their own struggle t must oveicomc their fear of whom chacko smiled me no not you my dear comrade of century of oppression then gomiade pillai in a hectoring voice quoted chairman mao in malayalam hts expression cuiiously like his niece s revolution is not a dinner party revolution is an insurrec tion an act of violence in which one class ovei throw another and so having bagged the contract for the synthetic cooking vinegar label he deftly banished chacko from the fighting rank of the oveithrowers to the treacherous rank of the to be overthrown they sat beside each other on steel folding chair on the afternoon of the day diat sophie mol came sipping coffee and crunching banana chip dislodging with their longues the sodden yellow mulch tliat stuck to the roof of their moutljs the small thin man and the big fat man comic book advei saries in a still to come war it turned out to be a war which unfortunately for comrade filial would end almost before it began victory wa gifted to wo w k is s i uik t i him wiappcd and bc ribboned on a silvi r u iy only ilun when it wa too late and paradise picklrs sliiiiiped solely to the floor without so much a a muiniur or wm the pictencr ol resistance did goniradc pillai rcaji r that what hr rcall needed wa the process of war more than the outcome of victor wai could have been the stallion that he rode p iri of if not all the way to the legislative assembly whereas victory left him no better oft than wlicn he started out he broke the egg but burned the omeleiie nobody ever learned the precise nature of the role that com rade filial played m the event that followed even ghacko who knew that the fervent high pitched speech about right of unlouchables caste is glass comrade delivered by com adc pillai during the marxist party siege of paradise pickle weie pharisaic never learned the whole story not lhat he cared to find out by then numbed by the loss of sophie mol he looked out at everything with a vision smudged with grief like a child touched by tragedy who grows up suddenly and abandon his plaything ghacko dumped his toy fickle baron dream and the people s war joined the rack of broken air plane m his glass paned cupboard after paradise pickle closed down some rice field were sold along with their mortgage to pay oft the bank loan more were sold to keep the family in food and clodies by the time ghacko emigrated to canada the family s only income came from the rubber estate chat atyoined the ayemenem house and the few coconut tree in the com pound this wa what baby kochamma and kochu maria lived off aftei everybody else had died lcft or been returned to be fair to goinrade pillai he did not plan the course of event that followed he meiely slipped his ready finger into hisiory s waiting glove it wa not entirely his fault that he lived in a society where a man s death could be more profitable than his life had ever been s i the god of small thing velutha s last visit to comrade filial after his confrontation with mammachi and baby kochamma and what had passed between them remained a secret the last betrayal that sent velutha across the river swimming against the current in the dark and rain well in time for his blind date with history velutha caught the last bus back from kottayam where he wa having the canning machine mended he ran into one of the other factory worker at the bus stop who told him with a smirk that mammachi wanted to see him velutha had no idea what had happened and wa completely unaware of his father s drunken visit to the ayemenem house nor did he know that veliya paapen had been sitting for hour at the door of iheir hut still drunk his glass eye and the edge of his axe glittering in the lamplight waiting for velutha to return nor that poor paralysed kuttappen numb with apprehension had been talk ing to his father continuously for two hour trying to calm him down all the time straining his ear for the sound of a footstep or the rustle of undergrowth so that he could shout a warning to his unsuspecting brother velutha didn t go home he went straight to the ayemenem house though on the one hand he wa taken by surprise on the othei he knew had known with an ancient instinct chat one day history s twisted chicken would come home to roost through the whole of mammachi s outburst he remained restrained and strangely composed it wa a composure bom of extreme provocation it stemmed from a lucidity that lie beyond rage when velutha arrived mammachi lost her bearing and spewed her blind venom her crass insunerable insult at a the god oi small thing panel in the siiding folding door until baby kocliamma tactfully swivelled hei around and aimed her rage in the right direction at vclutha standing very still in the gloom mammachi con tinued her tirade her eye empty her face twisted and ugly her anger piopelling hei towards velutha until she wa shouting right into his face and he could feel the spray of her spit and smell the stale tea on her breath baby kochamma stayed close to mammachi she said nothing but used her hand to modulate mamtnachi s fury to stoke it anew an encouraging pat on the back a reassuring arm around the shoulder mammachi wa completely unaware of the manipulation just vjiere an old lady like her who wore crisp ironed sans and played the mutcracker suite on the violin in the evening had learned the foul language that mammachi used that day wa a mystery to everybody baby kochantma kochu maiia ammu in her locked room who heard her outr she had screamed eventually if i find you on my property tomonxiw i ll have you castrated like the pariah dog that you are i ll have you killed we u see about that velutha said quietly that wa all he said and that wa what baby kochamma in inspector thomas mathew s office enhanced and embroid ered into threat of murder and abduction mammachi spat into vclutha s face thick spit it spattered across his skin his mouth and eye he just stood there stunned then he turned and left a he walked away from the house he felt his sens had been honed and heightened a though eveiy thing around him had been flattened into a neat illustration a machine drawing with an instruction manual that told him what to do his mind despeiately craving some kind of mooring clung to detail it labelled each thing it encounteied gvito he thought a he walked out of the gate gate road stone sfy rain work j gate road siones sky rain the ram on his skin wa warm the laiciitc lock undci his foot jagged he knew wjiere he wa going he noticed cvci y thing each

to meet him and the darkness grew dense glutinous pushing through it became an effort like swimming underwater il s hqppemngt a voice informed him it ha b ti his mind suddenly impossibly old floated out of his body and hovered high above him m the air from where it jabbered useless warning it looked down and watched a young maii s body walk through the darkness and the driving ram more than anything else that body wanted to sleep sleep and wake up in another world with the sniell of her skin m the atr that he breathed her body he ood of small thincis on hu me m kt never see her ogam l iere wa she wfiai had ih done to h t had ih hurt ker he kept walking his face wa neither lifted towaids the rainj noi bent away from it he neither welcomed it nor warded it off though the ram washed mammachi s spit off his face it didn t stop the feeling that somebody had lifted off his head and vomited into his body lumpy vomit dribbling down his inside over his heart his lung the slow thick drip into the pit of his stomach all his oigans awash m vomit there wa nothing that rain could do about that he knew what he had to do the instruction manual directed him he had to get to comrade pillai he no longei knew why his foot took him to lucky press which wa locked and then acioss the tiny yard to comrade fiuai s house just the effort of lifting his arm to knock exhausted him comrade piuai had finished his avial and wa squashing a npe banana extruding the sludge through his closed fist into his plate of curd when velutha knocked he sent his wife to open the door she returned looking sulky and comrade pslai thought sud denly sexy he wanted to touch her breast immediately but he had curd on his finger and there wa someone at the door kaly ani sat on the bed and absent nundedly patted lenin who wa asleep next to his tiny grandmother sucking his thumb who is it that paapen paravanes son he say it s urgent comrade pillai finished his curd unhurriedly he waggled his finger over his plate kalyani brought water in a little stainless steel container and poured it out for him the leftover morsel of food in his plate a dry red chilli and stiff angular brush of sucked and spat out drumstick rose and floated she brought him a hand towel he wiped his hand belched his appreciation and went to the door s work is stkoogii enda at this time of the night a he replied velutha heard his own voice beat back at him a though it had hit a wall he tried to explain what had hap pened but he could hear himseirslipping into incoherence i he man he wa talking to wa small and far away behind a wall of glass this is a little village comrade pillai wa saying tcople talk i listen to what they say it s not a though i don t know what s been going on once again velutha heard himself say something which made no difference to the man he spoke to his own voice coiled around him like a snake maybe comrade piuai said but comrade you should know that party wa not constituted to support worker indisci pline in their private life velutha watched comrade pdlai s body lade from the door his disembodied piping voice stayed on and sent out slogan pennant fluttering in an empty doorway it is not tn t ie party s interest to take up such matter indwiduals interest t subordmaie to the ofjgjamzalion s interest vtolahr parfy discipline mean molaivng party unity the voice went on sentence disaggregated into phrase word process qf he remluluni annihilaiton qf the class enemy comprador capttabsl sprtng diunder and there it wa again another religion turned against itself another edifice constructed by the human mind decimated by human nature comrade l illai shut the door and returned to his wife and dinner he decided to cat another banana what did he want his wife asked handing him one tht ood of mal u thinos they ve found out someone must have told them they ve sacked him is that all he s lucky they haven t had him strung up from the nearest tree i noticed sometliing stiange comrade pillai said a he peeled his banana the fellow had led varnish on in nail standing outside in the rain in the cold wet light from the single streetlight velutha wa suddenly overcome by sleep he had to force his eyelid to stay open tomormwy he told himself tomorrow when the ram stop his foot walked him to the river a though they were the leash and he were the dog histoiy walking the dog s the grossing it wa past midnight the river had risen it water quicksand black snaking towards the sea carrying with it cloudy night sky a whole paim frond part of a thatched fence and other gifls the wind had given it in a while the rain slowed to a drizzle and then stopped the breeze shook water from the tree and for a while it rained only under tree where shelter had once been a weak watery moon filtered through the cloud and revealed a young man sitting on the topmost of thirteen stone step that led into the water he wa very still very wet very young in a while he stood up took off the white mundu he wa wearing squeezed the water from it and twisted it around his head like a turban naked now he walked down the thirteen stone step into the water and further until the nver wa chest high then he began to swim with easy powerful stroke striking out towards where the current wa swift and certain where the really deep began the moonlit river fell from his swimming arm like sleeve of silver it took him only a few minute to make the ciossing when he reached the odier side he emeiged gleaming and pulled himself ashore black a the night that sui rounded him black a the water he had crossed he stepped onto the path that led through the swamp to the history house he left no ripple in the water the god of small thing no footprint on the shore he held his mundu spread above his head to dry the wind lifted it like a sail he wa suddenly happy third will get wone he thought to himseir then better he wa walking swiftly now towards the heart of darkness a lonely a a wolf the god of loss the god of small thing naked but for his nail varnish a few hour later three child on the river bank a pair of twin and another whose mauve corduroy pinafore said holulqy in a tilung happy font wet leaf in the tree shimmered like beaten metal dense clump of yellow bamboo drooped into the river a though g ieving in advance for what they knew wa going to happen the river itself wa dark and quiet an absence rather dian a pi esence betraying no sign of how high and strong it really wa estha and rahcl diagged the boat out of the bush where they usually hid it the paddle that velutha had made were hidden in a hollow tree they set it down in the water and held it steady for sophie mol to dimb in they seemed to trust the darlsness and moved up and down the glistening stone step a surefooted a young goat sophie mol wa more tentative a little frightened of what lurked in tlie shadow around her she had a cloth bag with food purloined from the fridge slung across her chest bread cake biscuit the twin weighed down by their mother s word weren t fir you i would he fiee i should harm dumped you tn an orphanage the day you were bom tau re the mtilsiones round my neck carried nothing thanks to what the orangedrink lemondrink man did to estha their home away from home wa already equipped in the two week since estha rowed scarlet jam and the god of

antas koala with loosened button eye what if ammu find u and b s u to come back then we will but only if she begs escha the compassionate sophie mol had convinced the twin that it wa essenhal that she go along too that the absence of child all child would heighten die adult remoise it would make them truly sorry like tlie grown ups in hamelin after the pied piper took away all uieir cluldren they would search cverywheie and just when they were sure that all three of them weie dead they would return home in triumph valued loved and needed more than ever her clinching ailment wa that if she were left behind she might be tortured and foiced to leveal their hiding place estha waited until rahel got m then took his place sitting astride the little boat a though it were a seesaw he used his leg to push the boat away from the shore a they lurched into the deeper water they began to row diagonally opsti cam against the current the way velutha had taught them to if you want to end up there you must aim there in the dark tliey couldn t see that they were in the wrong lane on a silent highway full of muffled traffic that branch log part of tree were motonng towards them at some speed they were past the really deep only yard from tile other side when they collided ivith a floating log and the little boat tipped over it had happened to them often enough on previous expedition across the river and they would swim after the boat and using it a a float dog paddle to the shoie this time they couldn t see their boat in the daik it wa swept away in the curient they headed for the shore sui prised at how much eflbrt it took them to cover that short distance a i f w ho l r la t r estha managed to grab a low branch ihai arcliccl down iruo the watei he peered downi ivcr through the darkness lo see if he could see the boat at all i can t see anything it s gone rahel covered in slush clambeied ashore and held a hand out to help estlia pull himself out of the water it took them a few minute to catch tlieir breath and regisiei the loss of the boat to mourn it passing and all our food is spoiled rahel said to sophie mol and wa met with silence a lushtng rolling ishswimming silence sophie mop she whispered lo the rushing riven we ie here here neai the ilhmba treei nothing on rahel s heart pappachi s moth snapped open it sombre wing out in and lifled it leg up down they ran along the bank calling out to her but she wa gone carried away on the muhled highway gieygreen with fish in it widi the sky and tree in it and at night the broken yellow moon in it theie wa no storm music no whirlpool spun up from the inky depth of the meenachal no shark supervised the tragedy just a quiet handing over ceremony a boat spilling u cargo a river accepting the offering one small life a brief sunbeam with a silver thimble clenched for luck in it litde fist it wa four in the morning still dark when the twina exhaus ted disli aught and covered in mud made their way through the swamp and approached the history house hansel and grctel m a ghastly fairy tale in which their dream would be captui ed and redreamed they lay down in the back verandah in i god or small thing on a grass mat

the man being beaten wa velutha where had he come from what had he done why had the policeman brought him here they heard the thud of wood on flesh boot on bone on teeth the muffled grunt when a stomach is kicked in the muted crunch of skull on cement the gurgle of blood on a man breath when his lung is torn by the jagged end of a broken rib blue lipped and dinncr plate eycd they watched mesmer ized by something that they sensed but didn t understand the absence of caprice in what the policeman did the abyss where anger should have been the sober steady brutality the economy of it all they were opening a bottle or shutting a tap cracking an egg to make an omelette the twans were too young to know that these were only history s henchman sent to square the book and collect tlie due

between themselves and him any implication that if nothing else at least biologically he wa a fellow creature had been severed long ago they were not arresting a man they weic exoicizing feai they had no instrument to calibrate how much punishment he could trike no mean of gauging how much or how permanently they had damaged him unlike the custom of rampaging religious mob or conquering army running not that morning m the heart of darkness the posse of touchable policeman acted with economy not frenzy efficiency not anarchy responsibility not hysteria they didn t tear out his hair or burn him alive they didn t hack off his genitals and stuff them in his mouth they didn t rape him or behead him after all they were not battling an epidemic they were merely inoculating a community against

ssenetilop ecneidebo yt ayoli ecnegilletnl rahel said ysetruoc ycneiciflee to his credit inspector thomas mathew remained calm he sensed the growing incoherence in the child he noted the dilated pupil he had seen it all before the human mind s escape valve it way of managing tiauma he made allowance for that and couched his question cleverly innocuously between when is your birthday mon and what s your favourite colour mol gradually in a fractured disjointed fashion thing began to thr ood oi smai rlllncis fall into place his men had briefed him about the pot and pan the grass mat the impossible to forget toy they began to make sense now inspector thomas mathew wa not amused he sent ajeep for baby kochamma he made sure that the child were not m the room when she arrived he didn t greet her have a seat he said baby kochamma sensed that something wa terribly wrong have you found them is everything all right nothing is all right the inspector assured her from the look in his eye and the tone of his voice baby kochamma realized that she wa dealing with a different person this dmc not the accommodating police officer of their previous meeting she lowered heiself into a chair inspector thomas mathew didn t mince his word the kottayam police had acted on die basis of an fir filed by her the paravan had been caught unfortunately he had been badly injured in the encounter and in all likelihood would not live through the night but now the child said that they had gone of their own volition their boat had capsized and the english child had drowned by accident which left the police saddled with the death in custody of a technically innocent man true he wa a paravan true he had misbehaved but these were troubled time and technically a per the law he wa an innocent man there wa no case attempted lape baby kochamma suggested weakly where is the rape victim s complaint ha it been filed ha she made a statement have you brought it with you the inspector s tone wa belligerent almost hostile baby kochamma looked a though she had shiunk pouch of flesh hung from her eye and jowl fear fermented in her and the spit in hci mouth turned sour the inspector pushed a glass of water towards her the matter is very simple either the rape victim must hie a complaint or the child must identify the paravan a their saving ammu abductor in the presence of a police witness or he wait d for baby kochamma to look at him or i must cliar you with lodging a false p lr criminal offence sweat stained baby kochamma s light blue blomc dark blue inspector thomas mathew didn t hustle her he knew that given the political climate he hiinsclf could be in very serious trouble he wa aware that comrade k n m pillai would not pas up this oppoitumty he kicked himself for acting so impulsively he used his printed hand towel to reach inside his shirt and wipe his chest and armpit it wa quiet in his office the sound of police station activity the clumping of boot the occasional howl of pain from somebody being interrogated seemed distant a though they were coming from somewheic else the child will do a they re told baby kochamma said if i could have a few moment alone with them a you wish the inspector rose to leave the office please give me five minute before you send them in inspector thomas mathew nodded his assent and left baby kochamma wiped her shining sweaty face she stretched her neck looking up at tlie ceiling in aider to wqie the sweat from crevice between her roll of neckfat with the end of her pallu she kissed her crucifix had marjtj of gmee the word of the prayer desened

the bedbug the beating she dwelled on the long year ammu would be put away because of them how she would be an old sick woman with louse in her hair when she came out if she didn t die in jail that wa systematically in hoi kind concerned voice she conjured up the macabre future in store for them when she had stamped out every ray of hope destroyed their life completely like a fairy godmother she pre sented them with a solution god would never forgive them for what they had done but here on earth there wa a way of undoing some of the damage of saving their mother from humiliation and suffering on their account provided they were prepared to be practical lucidly baby kochamma said luckily for you the police have made a mistake a bicl mistake she paused you know what it ib don t you there

inside die paperweight which made the man and woman look a though they were waltzing underwater they looked happy maybe they were getting married she in her white dress he in his black suit and bow

say yes then we can all go home it s so easy it s a small price to pay baby kochamma followed estha s gaze it wa all she could do to prevent herself from taking the paperweight and flinging it out of the window her heart wa hammering so she said with a bright brittle smile the strain beginning to tell in her voice what shall i tell the inspector uncle what have we decided d you want to save ammu

inspector s pot in his attached toilet tlic flush doesn t work she said when she came out it s so annoying embarrassed that the inspector would see the colour and con sistency of her stool the lockup wa pitch dark estha could see nothing but he could hear the sound of rasping laboured breathing the smell of shit made him retch someone switched on the light bright bhndmg velutba appeared on the scummy slippery floor a mangled genie invoked by a modem lamp he wa naked his soiled mundu had come undone blood spilled from his skull the god oi small thing like a secret his face wa swollen and his head look liked a pumpkin too large and heavy for the slender stem it grew from a pumpkin with a monstrous upside down smile police boot stepped back from the rim of a pool of unne spreading from him the bright bare electric bulb reflected in it dead fish floated up in estha one of the policeman prodded velutha with his foot there wa no response inspector thomas mathew squatted on his haunch and raked his jeep key acioss the sole of velutha s foot swollen eye opened wandered then focused through a film of blood on a beloved child estha imagined that something in him smiled not his mouth but some other unhurt part of him his elbow perhaps or shoulder the inspector asked his question estha s mouth said yes childhood tiptoed out silence slid m like a bolt someone switched off the light and velutha disappeared on their way back in the police jeep baby kocliamma stopped at reliable medico for some galmposc she gave them two each by the time they reached ghungam bridge their eye were

right velutha didn t live through the night half an hour past midnight death came for him saving ammu and for the little family curled up and asleep on a blue cross stitch counterpane what came for them not death just the end of living after sophie mop funeral when aminu took them back to the police station and the inspector chose his mango tap tap the body had already been removed dumped m the uiemmady kujsjiy the pauper s pit where the police routtnely dump tlieir dead when baby kochamma heard about ammu s visit to the police station she wa terrified everything that she baby kochamma had done had been premised on one assumption she had gambled on the fact that arranu whatever else she did however angry she wa would never publicly admit to her relationship with velutha because according to baby kochamma that would amount to destroying herself and her child for ever but baby kochamma hadn t taken into account the unsafe edge in ammu the unmixablc mix the infintte tenderness of motherhood the reckless rage of a suicide bomber ammu s reaction stunned her the ground fell away from under her foot she knew she had an ally in inspector thomas mathew but how long would that last what if he were trans ferred and the case reopened it wa possible considering the shouting sloganeering crowd of party worker that comrade k n m filial had managed to assemble outside the gate that prevented the labourer from coming to work and left vast quantity of mango banana pineapple garlic and gingei rottmg slowly on the premise of paradise pickle baby kochamma knew she had to get ammu out of ayc menem a soon a possible she managed that by doing what she wa best at irrigating her field nourishing her crop with other people s passion she gnawed like a rat into the godown of

switched on her tangerine transistor a man s voice crackled through it an english song she hadn t heard before she sat there in the dark a lonely lambent woman looking out at her embittered aunt s ornamental garden listening to a tangerine to a voice from far away wafting through the night sailing over lake and river over dense head of tree past the yellow church past the school bumping up the dirt road up the step of tlie verandah to her barely listening to the music she watched the frenzy of insect flitting around the light vying to kill themselves the word of the song exploded in her

through the darkness like an insect follow ing a chemical trail she knew the path to the river a well a her child did and could have found her way there blind folded she didn t know what it wa tliat made her hurry through the undeigrowth that turned her walk into a run that made her arrive on the bank of tlie meenachal breathless sobbing a though she wa late for something a though her life depended on getting there in time a tlioiigh she knew he would be theio waiting a thougji ae knew she would come he did know that knowledge had slid into him that afternoon cleanly like the sharp edge of a knife when history had slipped up while he had held her little daughter in his anns when her eye had told him he wa not the only giver of gift that she had gift to give him too that in return for his boat his box his small windmill she would trade her deep dimple when she smiled her smooth brown skin her shining shoulder her eye that were always somewhere else he wasn t there ammu sat on the stone step that led to the water she bui led the cost or living her head m her arm feeling foolish fbi having been so we so ceriatn further downstream in the middle of the rivci vehuhd floated on his back looking up at the star his paralysed brother and his one eyed father had eaten the dinner he had cooked them and were asleep so he wa free to he m the river and drift slowly with the current a log a serene crocodile coconm tree bent into the river and watched him float by yclloiv bamboo wept small fish cook coquettish hbeities with him pecked him he flipped over and began to swim upstieam against the cut rent he turned towards the bank for one last look treading water feeling foolish for having been so sure so ceriam when he saw her the detonation almost drowned him it took all his strength to stay afloat he trod water standing in the middle of a dark nver she didn t see the knob of his head bobbing over the dark river he could have been anything a floating coconut in any case she wasn t looking her head wa buried in her arm he watched her he took jus tune had he known that he wa about to enter a tunnel whose only egress wa his own annihilation would he have turned away perhaps perhaps not who can tell he began to swim towards her qpietly cutting through the water with no fuss he had almost reached tlic bank when she looked up and saw him his foot touched the muddy riverbed a he rose from the dark nver and walked up the stone step she saw diat the world they stood in wa his that he belonged to it that it belonged to him the water the mud the tree mil god of

plank he planed each nail he diove each thing he made had moulded him had left it stamp on him had given him his strength his supple giacc he wore a thin white doth around his loin looped between his dark leg he shook the water from his hair she could see his smile in the dark his white sudden smile that he had carried with him from boyhood into manhood his only luggage they looked at each otlier they weren t thinking any more the time for that had come and gone smashed smile lay ahead of tliem but that would be later lay ter he stood before her with the river dripping from him she stayed sitting on the step watching him her face pale in the moonlight a sudden chill ciept over him his heart hammeicd it wa all a terrible mistake he had misunderstood her the whole dnng wa a figment of his imagination this wa a trap theie were people in the bush watching she wa the delec table bait how could it be otherwise they had seen him m the march he tiied to make his voice casual normal it came out in a croak ammukutty what is it she went to him and laid the length of hei body against his he just stood there he didn t touch her he wa shivering partly witli cold partly terror partly

she smelled the river on him his particular paravan smell dial so disgusted kochainma ammu put out hei tongue and tasted m the hollow of his throat on the lobe of his ear she pulled his head down towards her and kissed his mouth a cloudy kiss a kiss that demanded a kiss back he kissed her back firat cautiously then urgently slowly his arm came up behind her he stroked her back very gently she could feel the skin on in palm rough calloused sandpaper he wa carclul not to hurt her slie could feel how soft she felt to him she could feel herself through him hei skin the way her body existed only where he touched her tlie rest of her wa smoke she felt him shuddci against her his hand were on her haunch that could support a whole array of toothbi ushes pulling lier hip against his to let her know how much he wanted her biology designed the dance terror timed it dictated tlic rhythm with which their body answered each other a though they knew already that for each tremor of pleasure tiiey would pay with an equal measure of pain a thougji the knew that how far they went would be measured against how fai they would be taken so they held back tormented each other gave of each other slowly but that only made it worse it only raised the stake it only cost them more because it smoothed the wrinkle the fumble and rusli of unfamiliar love and roused them to lever pilch behind them the river pulsed through the darkness shim mering like wild silk yellow bamboo wept nighps elbow rested on the water and watched them they lay under the mangostcen tree where only recently a grey old boatplant with boatflowers and boatfiruit had been upiooted by a mobile republic a wasp a flag a surprised puff a fountain in a love in tokyo tut ood of smalt thing the scuir ing huirying boatworld wa already gone the white termite on their way to work the white ladybiids on their way home the white beetle burrowing away from the light the wliite grasshopper with whitewood violin the sad white

dieam aminuy naked now crouched over velutha her mouth on his he drew her hair around them like a tent like her child did when they wanted to exclude the outside world she slid furtlier clown introducing hei self to the rest of him his neck his nipple his chocolate stomach she sipped the last of the nvei from the hollow of his navel she pressed the heat of his election against her eyelid she tasted him salty in her mouth he sat up and diew her back to him she felt his belly tighten under her haid a a board she felt her wetness slipping on his skin he took her nipple in his mouth and cradled her other breast in his calloused palm velvet gloved in sandpaper at the moment that she guided him into her she caught a passing glimpse of his youth his jfout es the wondci in his eye at the secret he had unearthed and she smiled down at him a though he wa her child once he wa inside her fear wa derailed and biology took over the exist of living climbed to unaftorddble height though later baby kocliamina would say it wa a small fi ice to pay wa it two life two child s childhood and a history lesson for future oflenders clouded eye held clouded eye in a steady gaze and a lumi nous woman opened herself to a luminous man she wa a rue co i or i i vimf wide and deep a a iiver in spate he sailed on hei u iters she could feel him moving deeper and deeper into hei framir frenzied asking to be let in further fuither slopped only by the shape of her the shape ofhim and when he v a refused when he had touched the deepest depth of her wiili a sobbing shuddering sigh he drowned she lay against him their body slick with sweat she iclt his body drop away from her his breath become moic icgular she saw his eye clear he stroked her hair sensing that the knot that had eased in him wa still tight and qiintring in hci gently he turned her over on her back he wiped tlie sweat and grit from her with his wet cloth he lay over hei careful not to put his weight on her small stone pressed into the skin of his forearm he kissed her eye her car her breast hei belly her seven silver stretchmarks from her twin hc line of down that led from her navel to her dark triangle that told him where she wanted him to go the maide of her leg whcic hci skin wa softest then carpentcr s hand lifted her hip and an untouchable tongue touched the innermost part of her drank long and deep from the bowl of her she danced for him on that boat shaped piece of earth she lived he held her against him resting his back against the mango steen tree while she cned and laughed at once then for what seemed like an eternity but wa really no more than five minute slie slept leaning against him her back against his chest seven year of oblivion lifted off her and flew into ihc shadow on weighty quaking wing lake a dull steel peahen and on ammu s ro to age and death small sunny meadow appeared copper grass spangled with blue butterfly beyond it an abyss slowly the terror seeped back into him at what he had done at what he knew he would do again and again she woke to the sound of his heart knocking against his chest the god of small thing a though it wa searching for a way out for that movable nb a secret sliding folding panel his arm were still around her she could feel the muscle move while his hand played with a dry palm frond ammu smiled to herself in the daik thinking how much she loved his arm the shape and strength of them how safe she felt resting in them when actually it wa the most dangerous place she could be he folded his fear mto a perfect rose he held it out in the palm of his hand she took it from him and put it in her hair she moved closer wanting to be within him to touch more of him he gathered her into the cave of his body a breeze lifted off the river and cooled their warm body it wa a little cold a little wet a htde quiet the air but what wa there to say an hour lacer ammu disengaged herself gendy i have to go he said nothing didn t move he watched her dress only one thing mattered now they knew that it wa all they could ask of each other the only thing ever they both knew that even later on the thirteen night that followed this one instinc tively they stuck to the small thing the big thing ever lurked inside they knew that there wa nowhere for them to go they had nothing no future so they stuck to the small thing they laughed at ant bite on each other s bottom at clumsy caterpillar sliding off the end of leaf at overturned beetle that couldn t right themselves at the pair of small fish that always sou t vclutha out in the river and bit him at a particu lariy devout praying mantis at the minute spider who lived in a crack in the wall of the black verandah of the history house and camoufiaged himself by covering his body with bit of rub bish a sliver of wasp wing part of a cobweb dust leaf rot m r and mr dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people you d expect to be in volved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn t hold with such nonsense mr dursley wa the director of a firm called grunnings which made drill he wa a big beefy man with hardly any neck al though he did have a very large mustache mr dursley wa thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful a she spent so much of her time craning over garden fence spying on the neighbor the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there wa no finer boy any where the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear wa that somebody would discover it chapter one they didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potter mr potter wa mr dursley s sister but they hadn t met for several year in fact mr dursley pretended she didn t have a sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were a undursleyish a it wa possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbor would say if the potter arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potter had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy wa another good reason for keeping the potter away they didn t want dudley mixing with a child like that when mr and mr dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story start there wa nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious thing would soon be happen ing all over the country mr dursley hummed a he picked out his most boring tie for work and mr dursley gossiped away happily a she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mr dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley wa now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the wall little tyke chortled mr dursley a he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number four s drive it wa on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didn t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there wa a tabby cat standing on the corner the boy who lived of privet drive but there wasn t a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back a mr durs ley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it wa now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cat couldn t read map or sign mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind a he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drill he wa hoping to get that day but on the edge of town drill were driven out of his mind by something else a he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloak mr dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getup you saw on young people he supposed this wa some stupid new fashion he drummed his finger on the steering wheel and his eye fell on a huddle of these weirdo standing quite close by they were whis pering excitedly together mr dursley wa enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all why that man had to be older than he wa and wearing an emerald green cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this wa probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for some thing yes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minute later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drill mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadn t he might have found it harder to concentrate on drill that morning he didn t see the owl swoop chapter one ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed a owl after owl sped over head most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning he yelled at five different people he made several important tele phone call and shouted a bit more he wa in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he d stretch his leg and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery he d forgotten all about the people in cloak until he passed a group of them next to the baker s he eyed them angrily a he passed he didn t know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldn t see a single collecting tin it wa on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few word of what they were saying the potter that s right that s what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperer a if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he wa being stupid potter wasn t such an unusual name he wa sure there were lot of people called pot ter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasn t even sure his nephew wa called harry he d never even seen the boy it the boy who lived might have been harvey or harold there wa no point in wor rying mr dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didn t blame her if he d had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloak he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drill that afternoon and when he left the building at five o clock he wa still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door sorry he grunted a the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it wa a few second before mr dursley realized that the man wa wearing a violet cloak he didn t seem at all upset at being al most knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare don t be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today re joice for you know who ha gone at last even muggles like your self should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off mr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that wa he wa rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he wa imagining thing which he had never hoped before because he didn t approve of imagination a he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didn t improve his mood wa the tabby cat he d spotted that morning it wa now sitting on his garden wall he wa sure it wa the same one it had the same marking around it eye shoo said mr dursley loudly chapter one the cat didn t move it just gave him a stern look wa this nor mal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself to gether he let himself into the house he wa still determined not to mention anything to his wife mr dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over din ner all about mr next door s problem with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word won t mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally bird watcher everywhere have reported that the nation s owl have been behaving very unusually today although owl normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundred of sighting of these bird flying in every direction since sunrise expert are unable to explain why the owl have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster al lowed himself a grin most mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more shower of owl tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i don t know about that but it s not only the owl that have been acting oddly today viewer a far apart a kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday they ve had a downpour of shooting star perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it s not until next week folk but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting star all over britain owl flying by daylight mysterious people in cloak all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the potter the boy who lived mr dursley came into the living room carrying two cup of tea it wa no good he d have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you haven t heard from your sister lately have you a he had expected mr dursley looked shocked and angry af ter all they normally pretended she didn t have a sister no she said sharply why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owl shooting star and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today so snapped mr dursley well i just thought maybe it wa something to do with you know her crowd mr dursley sipped her tea through pursed lip mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name potter he decided he didn t dare instead he said a casually a he could their son he d be about dudley s age now wouldn t he i suppose so said mr dursley stiffly what s his name again howard isn t it harry nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agree he didn t say another word on the subject a they went upstairs to bed while mr dursley wa in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front gar den the cat wa still there it wa staring down privet drive a though it were waiting for something wa he imagining thing could all this have anything to do chapter one with the potter if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didn t think he could bear it the dursleys got into bed mr dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep wa that even if the potter were involved there wa no reason for them to come near him and mr dursley the potter knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldn t see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldn t affect them how very wrong he wa mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside wa showing no sign of sleepiness it wa sitting a still a a statue it eye fixed unblinkingly on the far cor ner of privet drive it didn t so much a quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owl swooped overhead in fact it wa nearly midnight before the cat moved at all a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching ap peared so suddenly and silently you d have thought he d just popped out of the ground the cat s tail twitched and it eye nar rowed nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he wa tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he wa wearing long robe a purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boot his blue eye were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacle and his nose wa very long and crooked a though it had been broken at least twice this man s name wa albus dumbledore the boy who lived albus dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boot wa unwel come he wa busy rummaging in his cloak looking for some thing but he did seem to realize he wa being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which wa still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he wa looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into dark ness twelve time he clicked the put outer until the only light left on the whole street were two tiny pinprick in the distance which were the eye of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed mr dursley they wouldn t be able to see anything that wa happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didn t look at it but after a moment he spoke to it fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he wa smiling at a rather severe looking woman who wa wearing square glass exactly the shape of the marking the cat had had around it eye she too wa wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair wa drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffled how did you know it wa me she asked my dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly chapter one you d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall all day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feast and party on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily oh yes everyone s celebrating all right she said impatiently you d think they d be a bit more careful but no even the mug gles have noticed something s going on it wa on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room window i heard it flock of owl shooting star well they re not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shoot ing star down in kent i ll bet that wa dedalus diggle he never had much sense you can t blame them said dumbledore gently we ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven year i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but that s no reason to lose our head people are being downright careless out on the street in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumor she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here a though hoping he wa going to tell her something but he didn t so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day you know who seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about u all i suppose he really ha gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop they re a kind of muggle sweet i m rather fond of the boy who lived no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly a though she didn t think this wa the moment for lemon drop a i say even if you know who ha gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you know who nonsense for eleven year i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dum bledore who wa unsticking two lemon drop seemed not to no tice it all get so confusing if we keep saying you know who i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort s name i know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but you re different everyone know you re the only one you know oh all right voldemort wa fright ened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had power i will never have only because you re too well noble to use them it s lucky it s dark i haven t blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuff professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owl are nothing next to the rumor that are flying around you know what everyone s saying about why he s disap peared about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she wa most anxious to discus the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither a a cat nor a a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare a she did now it wa plain that whatever everyone wa saying she wa not going chapter one to believe it until dumbledore told her it wa true dumbledore however wa choosing another lemon drop and did not answer what they re saying she pressed on is that last night vol demort turned up in godric s hollow he went to find the pot ters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they re dead dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gasped lily and james i can t believe it i didn t want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavily professor mcgonagall s voice trembled a she went on that s not all they re saying he tried to kill the potter son harry but he couldn t he couldn t kill that little boy no one know why or how but they re saying that when he couldn t kill harry potter voldemort s power somehow broke and that s why he s gone dumbledore nodded glumly it s it s true faltered professor mcgonagall after all he s done all the people he s killed he couldn t kill a little boy it s just astounding of all the thing to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eye beneath her spectacle dumbledore gave a great sniff a he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it wa a very odd watch it had twelve hand but no number in stead little planet were moving around the edge it must have the boy who lived made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrid s late i suppose it wa he who told you i d be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall and i don t suppose you re going to tell me why you re here of all place i ve come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle they re the only family he ha left now you don t mean you can t mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her foot and pointing at number four dumbledore you can t i ve been watching them all day you couldn t find two people who are less like u and they ve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweet harry potter come and live here it s the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older i ve written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him he ll be famous a legend i wouldn t be surprised if today wa known a harry potter day in the future there will be book written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glass it would be enough to turn any boy s head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he won t even remember can t you see how much better off he ll be growing up away from all that until he s ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind chapter one swallowed and then said yes yes you re right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak sud denly a though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it hagrid s bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something a im portant a this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore i m not saying his heart isn t in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can t pretend he s not careless he doe tend to what wa that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder a they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar a they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them if the motorcycle wa huge it wa nothing to the man sitting astride it he wa almost twice a tall a a normal man and at least five time a wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangle of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hand the size of trash can lid and his foot in their leather boot were like baby dolphin in his vast muscular arm he wa holding a bundle of blanket hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climb ing carefully off the motorcycle a he spoke young sirius black lent it to me i ve got him sir the boy who lived no problem were there no sir house wa almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep a we wa flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blanket inside just visible wa a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a cu riously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning is that where whispered professor mcgonagall yes said dumbledore he ll have that scar forever couldn t you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldn t scar can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london un derground well give him here hagrid we d better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arm and turned toward the dursleys house could i could i say good bye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog shhh hissed professor mcgonagall you ll wake the mug gles s s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handker chief and burying his face in it but i c c can t stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes it s all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or we ll be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid chapter one gingerly on the arm a dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harry s blanket and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid s shoulder shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore s eye seemed to have gone out well said dumbledore finally that s that we ve no business staying here we may a well go and join the celebration yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice i d best get this bike away g night professor mcgonagall professor dumble dore sir wiping his streaming eye on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply dumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer he clicked it once and twelve ball of light sped back to their street lamp so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blanket on the step of number four good luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he wa gone the boy who lived a breeze ruffled the neat hedge of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing thing to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blanket without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he wa special not know ing he wa famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hour time by mr dursley s scream a she opened the front door to put out the milk bottle nor that he would spend the next few week being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldn t know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glass and saying in hushed voice to harry potter the boy who lived c h a p t e r t w o the vanishing glass n early ten year had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gar den and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which wa almost exactly the same a it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owl only the photograph on the mantel piece really showed how much time had passed ten year ago there had been lot of picture of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnet but dudley durs ley wa no longer a baby and now the photograph showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too the vanishing glass yet harry potter wa still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia wa awake and it wa her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day up get up now harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door again up she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling he d had the same dream before his aunt wa back outside the door are you up yet she demanded nearly said harry well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and don t you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddy s birthday harry groaned what did you say his aunt snapped through the door nothing nothing dudley s birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for sock he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry wa used to spider because the cupboard under the stair wa full of them and that wa where he slept when he wa dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table wa almost hidden beneath all dudley s birthday pres ents it looked a though dudley had gotten the new computer he chapter two wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike wa a mystery to harry a dudley wa very fat and hated exercise unless of course it in volved punching somebody dudley s favorite punching bag wa harry but he couldn t often catch him harry didn t look it but he wa very fast perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really wa because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley s and dudley wa about four time bigger than he wa harry had a thin face knobbly knee black hair and bright green eye he wore round glass held to gether with a lot of scotch tape because of all the time dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance wa a very thin scar on his forehead that wa shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it a long a he could re member and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia wa how he had gotten it in the car crash when your parent died she had said and don t ask question don t ask question that wa the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys uncle vernon entered the kitchen a harry wa turning over the bacon comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircut than the rest of the boy in his class put the vanishing glass together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place harry wa frying egg by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eye and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig harry put the plate of egg and bacon on the table which wa difficult a there wasn t much room dudley meanwhile wa counting his present his face fell thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father that s two less than last year darling you haven t counted auntie marge s present see it s here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon a fast a possible in case dudley turned the table over aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and we ll buy you another two present while we re out today how s that popkin two more present is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so i ll have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled chapter two little tyke want his money s worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudley s hair at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer game and a vcr he wa ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried bad news vernon she said mr figg s broken her leg she can t take him she jerked her head in harry s direction dudley s mouth fell open in horror but harry s heart gave a leap every year on dudley s birthday his parent took him and a friend out for the day to adventure park hamburger restaurant or the movie every year harry wa left behind with mr figg a mad old lady who lived two street away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mr figg made him look at photograph of all the cat she d ever owned now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry a though he d planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mr figg had broken her leg but it wasn t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paw and tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested don t be silly vernon she hate the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this a though he wasn t there or rather a though he wa something very nasty that couldn t understand them like a slug what about what s her name your friend yvonne the vanishing glass on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley s computer aunt petunia looked a though she d just swallowed a lemon and come back and find the house in ruin she snarled i won t blow up the house said harry but they weren t listen ing i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car that car new he s not sitting in it alone dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasn t really cry it had been year since he d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him any thing he wanted dinky duddydums don t cry mummy won t let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arm around him i don t want him t t to come dudley yelled between huge pretend sob he always sp spoil everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother arm just then the doorbell rang oh good lord they re here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudley s best friend pier polkiss walked in with his mother pier wa a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he wa usually the one who held people s arm behind their back while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once half an hour later harry who couldn t believe his luck wa sit ting in the back of the dursleys car with pier and dudley on the chapter two way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadn t been able to think of anything else to do with him but be fore they d left uncle vernon had taken harry aside i m warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harry s i m warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas i m not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didn t believe him no one ever did the problem wa strange thing often happened around harry and it wa just no good telling the dursleys he didn t make them happen once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the bar bers looking a though he hadn t been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he wa almost bald except for his bang which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he wa already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glass next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly a it had been before aunt petu nia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldn t explain how it had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley s brown with orange puff ball the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldn t fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must the vanishing glass have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasn t pun ished on the other hand he d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchen dudley s gang had been chasing him a usual when a much to harry s surprise a anyone else s there he wa sitting on the chimney the dursleys had re ceived a very angry letter from harry s headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school building but all he d tried to do a he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cup board wa jump behind the big trash can outside the kitchen door harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump but today nothing wa going to go wrong it wa even worth be ing with dudley and pier to be spending the day somewhere that wasn t school his cupboard or mr figg s cabbage smelling living room while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about thing people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subject this morning it wa motorcycle roaring along like maniac the young hoodlum he said a a motorcycle overtook them i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it wa flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycle don t fly dudley and pier sniggered chapter two i know they don t said harry it wa only a dream but he wished he hadn t said anything if there wa one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking question it wa his talk ing about anything acting in a way it shouldn t no matter if it wa in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous idea it wa a very sunny saturday and the zoo wa crowded with fam ilies the dursleys bought dudley and pier large chocolate ice cream at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasn t bad either harry thought licking it a they watched a gorilla scratching it head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasn t blond harry had the best morning he d had in a long time he wa careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and pier who were starting to get bored with the animal by lunchtime wouldn t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn t have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry wa allowed to finish the first harry felt afterward that he should have known it wa all too good to last after lunch they went to the reptile house it wa cool and dark in there with lit window all along the wall behind the glass all sort of lizard and snake were crawling and slithering over bit of wood and stone dudley and pier wanted to see huge poisonous the vanishing glass cobra and thick man crushing python dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped it body twice around uncle vernon s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn t look in the mood in fact it wa fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coil make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didn t budge do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckle but the snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldn t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their finger on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it wa worse than hav ing a cupboard a a bedroom where the only visitor wa aunt petu nia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house the snake suddenly opened it beady eye slowly very slowly it raised it head until it eye were on a level with harry s it winked harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone wa watching they weren t he looked back at the snake and winked too the snake jerked it head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised it eye to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time chapter two i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasn t sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway harry asked the snake jabbed it tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at it boa constrictor brazil wa it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed it tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen wa bred in the zoo oh i see so you ve never been to brazil a the snake shook it head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump dudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you won t believe what it s doing dudley came waddling toward them a fast a he could out of the way you he said punching harry in the rib caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second pier and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howl of horror harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor s tank had vanished the great snake wa uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exit a the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house wa in shock the vanishing glass but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again pier and dud ley could only gibber a far a harry had seen the snake hadn t done anything except snap playfully at their heel a it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon s car dudley wa telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while pier wa swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least wa pier calming down enough to say harry wa talking to it weren t you harry uncle vernon waited until pier wa safely out of the house be fore starting on harry he wa so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meal before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didn t know what time it wa and he couldn t be sure the durs ley were asleep yet until they were he couldn t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food he d lived with the dursleys almost ten year ten miserable year a long a he could remember ever since he d been a baby and his parent had died in that car crash he couldn t remember being in the car when his parent had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hour in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed wa the crash though he couldn t imagine where all the green light came from he chapter two couldn t remember his parent at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he wa forbidden to ask question there were no photograph of them in the house when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that stranger in the street seemed to know him very strange stranger they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people wa the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look at school harry had no one everybody knew that dudley s gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and bro ken glass and nobody liked to disagree with dudley s gang c h a p t e r t h r e e the letter t from no one he escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever punishment by the time he wa allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holiday had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote con trol airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mr figg a she crossed privet drive on her crutch harry wa glad school wa over but there wa no escaping dud ley s gang who visited the house every single day pier dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but a dudley wa the biggest and stupidest of the lot he wa the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley s favorite sport harry hunting this wa why harry spent a much time a possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holi day where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in chapter three his life he wouldn t be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon s old private school smeltings pier polkiss wa go ing there too harry on the other hand wa going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this wa very funny they stuff people s head down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry the poor toilet s never had anything a horrible a your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what he d said one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mr figg s mr figg wasn t a bad a usual it turned out she d broken her leg tripping over one of her cat and she didn t seem quite a fond of them a before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of choco late cake that tasted a though she d had it for several year that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform smeltings boy wore maroon tailcoat orange knickerbockers and flat straw hat called boater they also carried knobbly stick used for hitting each other while the teacher weren t looking this wa supposed to be good train ing for later life a he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle ver non said gruffly that it wa the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tear and said she couldn t believe it wa her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grown up harry didn t trust himself to speak he thought two of his rib might already have cracked from trying not to laugh the letter from no one there wa a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub wa full of what looked like dirty rag swimming in gray water what s this he asked aunt petunia her lip tightened a they always did if he dared to ask a question your new school uniform she said harry looked in the bowl again oh he said i didn t realize it had to be so wet don t be stupid snapped aunt petunia i m dyeing some of dudley s old thing gray for you it ll look just like everyone else s when i ve finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he wa going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he wa wearing bit of old elephant skin probably dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled nose because of the smell from harry s new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper a usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letter on the doormat get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his pa per make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley chapter three harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three thing lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernon s sister marge who wa vacationing on the isle of wight a brown enve lope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a gi ant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friend no other relative he didn t be long to the library so he d never even got rude note asking for book back yet here it wa a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stair privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope wa thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address wa written in emerald green ink there wa no stamp turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a pur ple wax seal bearing a coat of arm a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bomb he chuckled at his own joke harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope the letter from no one uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard marge s ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harry s got something harry wa on the point of unfolding his letter which wa writ ten on the same heavy parchment a the envelope when it wa jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon that s mine said harry trying to snatch it back who d be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic light and it didn t stop there within second it wa the grayish white of old porridge p p petunia he gasped dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked a though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noise vernon oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasn t used to being ig nored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick i want to read that letter he said loudly i want to read it said harry furiously a it s mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the let ter back inside it envelope harry didn t move i want my letter he shouted chapter three let me see it demanded dudley out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruff of their neck and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glass dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor vernon aunt petunia wa saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleep you don t think they re watching the house watching spying might be following u muttered un cle vernon wildly but what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we don t want harry could see uncle vernon s shiny black shoe pacing up and down the kitchen no he said finally no we ll ignore it if they don t get an an swer yes that s best we won t do anything but i m not having one in the house petunia didn t we swear when we took him in we d stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something he d never done before he visited harry in his cup board where s my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door who s writing to me the letter from no one no one it wa addressed to you by mistake said uncle ver non shortly i have burned it it wa not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spider fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breath and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful er yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking you re really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudley s second bed room why said harry don t ask question snapped his uncle take this stuff up stair now the dursleys house had four bedroom one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitor usually uncle vernon s sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toy and thing that wouldn t fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here wa broken the month old video camera wa lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor s dog in the corner wa dudley s first ever television set which he d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there wa a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which wa up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelf were full of chapter three book they were the only thing in the room that looked a though they d never been touched from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i don t want him in there i need that room make him get out harry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday he d have given anything to be up here today he d rather be back in his cup board with that letter than up here without it next morning at breakfast everyone wa rather quiet dudley wa in shock he d screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tor toise through the greenhouse roof and he still didn t have his room back harry wa thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he d opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging thing with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted there s another one mr h potter the small est bedroom privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wres tle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which wa made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harry s letter clutched in his hand the letter from no one go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn t received his first letter surely that meant they d try again and this time he d make sure they didn t fail he had a plan the repaired alarm clock rang at six o clock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustn t wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the light he wa going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letter for number four first his heart hammered a he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh harry leapt into the air he d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive light clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncle s face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didn t do exactly what he d been try ing to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernon s lap harry could see three letter ad dressed in green ink i want he began but uncle vernon wa tearing the letter into piece before his eye chapter three uncle vernon didn t go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nail if they can t deliver them they ll just give up i m not sure that ll work vernon oh these people mind work in strange way petunia they re not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him on friday no less than twelve letter arrived for harry a they couldn t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the side and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letter he got out a hammer and nail and boarded up the crack around the front and back door so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulip a he worked and jumped at small noise on saturday thing began to get out of hand twenty four letter to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden in side each of the two dozen egg that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone call to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letter in her food processor who on earth want to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement the letter from no one on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy no post on sunday he reminded them cheerfully a he spread marmalade on his newspaper no damn letter today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney a he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next mo ment thirty or forty letter came pelting out of the fireplace like bullet the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arm over their face uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letter still streaming into the room bouncing off the wall and floor that doe it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tuft out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minute ready to leave we re going away just pack some clothes no argument he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minute later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up door and were in the car speeding toward the highway dudley wa sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sport bag they drove and they drove even aunt petunia didn t dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while chapter three shake em off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this they didn t stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley wa howling he d never had such a bad day in his life he wa hungry he d missed five television program he d wanted to see and he d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirt of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin bed and damp musty sheet dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the light of passing car and wondering they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomato on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table scuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman stared i ll take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and fol lowing her from the dining room the letter from no one wouldn t it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hour later but uncle vernon didn t seem to hear her exactly what he wa looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage daddy s gone mad hasn t he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared it started to rain great drop beat on the roof of the car dud ley sniveled it s monday he told his mother the great humberto s on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television monday this reminded harry of something if it wa mon day and you could usually count on dudley to know the day of the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday wa harry s eleventh birthday of course his birthday were never ex actly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernon s old sock still you weren t eleven every day uncle vernon wa back and he wa smiling he wa also carry ing a long thin package and didn t answer aunt petunia when she asked what he d bought found the perfect place he said come on everyone out it wa very cold outside the car uncle vernon wa pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the chapter three rock wa the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing wa certain there wa no television in there storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clap ping his hand together and this gentleman s kindly agreed to lend u his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them i ve already got u some ration said uncle vernon so all aboard it wa freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their neck and a chilly wind whipped their face after what seemed like hour they reached the rock where uncle vernon slip ping and sliding led the way to the broken down house the inside wa horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gap in the wooden wall and the fireplace wa damp and empty there were only two room uncle vernon s ration turned out to be a bag of chip each and four banana he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bag just smoked and shriveled up could do with some of those letter now eh he said cheer fully he wa in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didn t cheer him up at all a night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high wave splattered the wall of the hut and a fierce the letter from no one wind rattled the filthy window aunt petunia found a few moldy blanket in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth eaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry wa left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket the storm raged more and more ferociously a the night went on harry couldn t sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudley s snore were drowned by the low roll of thunder that started near mid night the lighted dial of dudley s watch which wa dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he d be eleven in ten minute time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer won dering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer wa now five minute to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasn t going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did four minute to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letter when they got back that he d be able to steal one somehow three minute to go wa that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minute to go what wa that funny crunching noise wa the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and he d be eleven thirty second twenty ten nine maybe he d wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone wa outside knocking to come in c h a p t e r f o u r the keeper of the key b oom they knocked again dudley jerked awake where s the cannon he said stupidly there wa a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skid ding into the room he wa holding a rifle in his hand now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them who s there he shouted i warn you i m armed there wa a pause then smash the door wa hit with such force that it swung clean off it hinge and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor a giant of a man wa standing in the doorway his face wa al most completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eye glinting like black beetle under all the hair the keeper of the key the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into it frame the noise of the storm out side dropped a little he turned to look at them all couldn t make u a cup o tea could yeh it s not been an easy journey he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said the stranger dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who wa crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an here s harry said the giant harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eye were crinkled in a smile la time i saw you you wa only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yer dad but yeh ve got yer mom s eye uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise i demand that you leave at once sir he said you are break ing and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle ver non s hand bent it into a knot a easily a if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on anyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but it ll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly chapter four squashed box harry opened it with trembling finger inside wa a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the word got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said in stead wa who are you the giant chuckled true i haven t introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of key and ground at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harry s whole arm what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hand to gether i d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh ve got it mind his eye fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bag in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldn t see what he wa doing but when he drew back a second later there wa a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him a though he d sunk into a hot bath the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sort of thing out of the pocket of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausage a poker a teapot several chipped mug and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut wa full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant wa working but a he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausage from the poker dudley fidgeted a lit tle uncle vernon said sharply don t touch anything he give you dudley the giant chuckled darkly the keeper of the key yer great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore durs ley don worry he passed the sausage to harry who wa so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldn t take his eye off the giant finally a nobody seemed about to explain any thing he said i m sorry but i still don t really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand call me hagrid he said everyone doe an like i told yeh i m keeper of key at hogwarts yeh ll know all about hog wart o course er no said harry hagrid looked shocked sorry harry said quickly sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadow it s them a should be sorry i knew yeh weren t gettin yer letter but i never thought yeh wouldn t even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud did yeh never wonder where yer parent learned it all all what asked harry all what hagrid thundered now wait jus one second he had leapt to his foot in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut the dursleys were cowering against the wall do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy know nothin abou about anything harry thought this wa going a bit far he had been to school after all and his mark weren t bad i know some thing he said i can you know do math and stuff chapter four but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean your world my world yer parent world what world hagrid looked a if he wa about to explode dursley he boomed uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he said i mean they re famous you re famous what my my mom and dad weren t famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his finger through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare yeh don know what yeh are he said finally uncle vernon suddenly found his voice stop he commanded stop right there sir i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage you never told him never told him what wa in the letter dumbledore left fer him i wa there i saw dumbledore leave it dursley an you ve kept it from him all these year kept what from me said harry eagerly stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror ah go boil yer head both of yeh said hagrid harry yer a wizard there wa silence inside the hut only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard the keeper of the key i m a what gasped harry a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin good un i d say once yeh ve been trained up a bit with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be an i reckon it s abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish enve lope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hut on the rock the sea he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sorc chf warlock supreme mugwump international confed of wizard dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that

yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress chapter four question exploded inside harry s head like firework and he couldn t decide which to ask first after a few minute he stam mered what doe it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgon that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffled looking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter taking him to buy his thing tomorrow weather s horrible hope you re well hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in it beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down a though this wa a normal a talking on the telephone harry realized his mouth wa open and closed it quickly where wa i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashen faced but looking very angry moved into the fire light he s not going he said hagrid grunted i d like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said a what said harry interested the keeper of the key a muggle said hagrid it s what we call nonmagic folk like them an it s your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eye on we swore when we took him in we d put a stop to that rub bish said uncle vernon swore we d stamp it out of him wizard indeed you knew said harry you knew i m a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly knew of course we knew how could you not be my dratted sister being what she wa oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pocket full of frog spawn turning teacup into rat i wa the only one who saw her for what she wa a freak but for my mother and father oh no it wa lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for year then she met that potter at school and they left and got mar ried and had you and of course i knew you d be just the same just a strange just a a abnormal and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you harry had gone very white a soon a he found his voice he said blown up you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner how could a car crash kill lily an james potter it s an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world know his name chapter four but why what happened harry asked urgently the anger faded from hagrid s face he looked suddenly anxious i never expected this he said in a low worried voice i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didn t know ah harry i don know if i m the right person ter tell yeh but someone s got ta yeh can t go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys well it s best yeh know a much a i can tell yeh mind i can t tell yeh everythin it s a great myst ry part of it he sat down stared into the fire for a few second and then said it begin i suppose with with a person called but it s incredible yeh don t know his name everyone in our world know who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it no one doe why not gulpin gargoyle harry people are still scared blimey this is difficult see there wa this wizard who went bad a bad a you could go worse worse than worse his name wa hagrid gulped but no word came out could you write it down harry suggested nah can t spell it all right voldemort hagrid shud dered don make me say it again anyway this this wizard about twenty year ago now started lookin fer follower got em too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he wa gettin himself power all right dark day harry didn t the keeper of the key know who ter trust didn t dare get friendly with strange wizard or witch terrible thing happened he wa takin over course some stood up to him an he killed em horribly one o the only safe place left wa hogwarts reckon dumbledore s the only one you know who wa afraid of didn t dare try takin the school not jus then anyway now yer mum an dad were a good a witch an wizard a i ever knew head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the mys t ry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side be fore probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way all anyone know is he turned up in the village where you wa all living on halloween ten year ago you wa just a year old he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn sorry he said but it s that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldn t find anyway you know who killed em an then an this is the real myst ry of the thing he tried to kill you too wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then but he couldn t do it never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that wa no ordinary cut that s what yeh get when a powerful evil curse touch yeh took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even but it didn t work on you an that s why yer famous harry no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an he d killed some o the best witch an wizard chapter four of the age the mckinnons the bone the prewetts an you wa only a baby an you lived something very painful wa going on in harry s mind a ha grid s story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh hagrid wa watching him sadly took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledore s or ders brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon cer tainly seemed to have got back his courage he wa glaring at ha grid and his fist were clenched now you listen here boy he snarled i accept there s some thing strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldn t have cured and a for all this about your parent well they were weirdo no denying it and the world s better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding type just what i expected always knew they d come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a bat tered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said i m warning you dursley i m warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernon s courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent the keeper of the key that s better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor harry meanwhile still had question to ask hundred of them but what happened to vol sorry i mean you know who good question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you make yeh even more famous that s the biggest myst ry see he wa gettin more an more powerful why d he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say he s still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who wa on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trance don reckon they could ve done if he wa comin back most of u reckon he s still out there somewhere but lost his power too weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harry there wa somethin goin on that night he hadn t counted on i dunno what it wa no one doe but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eye but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be he d spent his life being clouted by dudley and bul lied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he wa really a wizard why hadn t they been turned into warty toad every time they d tried to lock him in his cupboard if he d once defeated the great est sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football chapter four hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mi take i don t think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled not a wizard eh never made thing happen when you wa scared or angry harry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudley s gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous hair cut he d managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him hadn t he got his revenge without even realiz ing he wa doing it hadn t he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid wa positively beaming at him see said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait you ll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasn t going to give in without a fight haven t i told you he s not going he hissed he s going to stonewall high and he ll be grateful for it i ve read those let ters and he need all sort of rubbish spell book and wand and if he want ter go a great muggle like you won t stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hog wart yer mad his name s been down ever since he wa born he s off ter the

harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped it beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat hagrid said harry loudly there s an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa what he want payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pocket hagrid s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pocket bunch of key slug pellet ball of string peppermint humbug teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coin give him five knut said hagrid sleepily knut the little bronze one harry counted out five little bronze coin and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open window hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched best be off harry lot ter do today got ta get up ter london an buy all yer

on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked spell enchantment said hagrid unfolding his news paper a he spoke they say there s dragon guardin the high security vault and then yeh got ta find yer way gringotts is hundred of mile under london see deep under the under ground yeh d die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did

country why why blimey harry everyone d be wantin magic solution to their problem nah we re best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone step onto the street passersby stared a lot at hagrid a they walked through the little town to the station harry couldn t blame them not only wa ha grid twice a tall a anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordi nary thing like parking meter and saying loudly see that harry thing these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit a he ran to keep up did

wondered aloud if yeh know where to go said hagrid harry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he wa going he wa obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seat were too small and the train too slow i don t know how the muggles manage without magic he said a they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shop hagrid wa so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry chapter five had to do wa keep close behind him they passed book shop and music store hamburger restaurant and cinema but nowhere that looked a if it could sell you a magic wand this wa just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be pile of wizard gold buried mile beneath them were there really shop that sold spell book and broomstick might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadn t known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far wa unbelievable harry couldn t help trusting him this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron it s a famous place it wa a tiny grubby looking pub if hagrid hadn t pointed it out harry wouldn t have noticed it wa there the people hurrying by didn t glance at it their eye slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other a if they couldn t see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this ha grid had steered him inside for a famous place it wa very dark and shabby a few old woman were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glass of sherry one of them wa smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat wa talk ing to the old bartender who wa quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid diagon alley can t tom i m on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harry s shoulder and making harry s knee buckle good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tear in his eye welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didn t know what to say everyone wa looking at him the old woman with the pipe wa puffing on it without realizing it had gone out hagrid wa beaming then there wa a great scraping of chair and the next moment harry found himself shaking hand with everyone in the leaky cauldron doris crockford mr potter can t believe i m meeting you at last so proud mr potter i m just so proud always wanted to shake your hand i m all of a flutter delighted mr potter just can t tell you diggle s the name dedalus diggle i ve seen you before said harry a dedalus diggle s top hat fell off in his excitement you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone did you hear that he remembers me chapter five harry shook hand again and again doris crockford kept coming back for more a pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eye wa twitching professor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teacher at hogwarts p p potter stammered professor quirrell grasping harry s hand c can t t tell you how p pleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell d defense against the d d dark art muttered professor quirrell a though he d rather not think about it n not that you n need it eh p p potter he laughed nervously you ll be g getting all your equipment i suppose i ve g got to p pick up a new b book on vampire m myself he looked terrified at the very thought but the others wouldn t let professor quirrell keep harry to himself it took almost ten minute to get away from them all at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble must get on lot ter buy come on harry doris crockford shook harry s hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there wa nothing but a trash can and a few weed hagrid grinned at harry told yeh didn t i told yeh you wa famous even professor quirrell wa tremblin ter meet yeh mind you he s usually trem blin is he always that nervous oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he wa fine while he wa diagon alley studyin outta book but then he took a year off ter get some first hand experience they say he met vampire in the black forest and there wa a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since scared of the student scared of his own subject now where s me umbrella vampire hag harry s head wa swimming hagrid mean while wa counting brick in the wall above the trash can three up two across he muttered right stand back harry he tapped the wall three time with the point of his umbrella the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a sec ond later they were facing an archway large enough even for ha grid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harry s amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the arch way shrink instantly back into solid wall the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldron outside the near est shop cauldron all size copper brass pewter sil ver self stirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them yeah you ll be needin one said hagrid but we got ta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eye he turned his head in every direction a they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shop the thing outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary wa chapter five shaking her head a they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickle an ounce they re mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boy of about harry s age had their nose pressed against a window with broomstick in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shop selling robe shop selling telescope and strange silver instrument harry had never seen before window stacked with barrel of bat spleen and eel eye tottering pile of spell book quill and roll of parchment potion bottle globe of the moon gringotts said hagrid they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shop standing beside it burnished bronze door wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold wa yeah that s a goblin said hagrid quietly a they walked up the white stone step toward him the goblin wa about a head shorter than harry he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long finger and foot he bowed a they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of door silver this time with word engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn so if you seek beneath our floor a treasure that wa never yours diagon alley thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there like i said yeh d be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid a pair of goblin bowed them through the silver door and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblin were sit ting on high stool behind a long counter scribbling in large ledger weighing coin in brass scale examining precious stone through eyeglass there were too many door to count leading off the hall and yet more goblin were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the counter morning said hagrid to a free goblin we ve come ter take some money outta mr harry potter s safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pocket onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuit over the goblin book of number the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of ru bies a big a glowing coal got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key the goblin looked at it closely that seems to be in order an i ve also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest it s about the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully very well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vault griphook griphook wa yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed chapter five all the dog biscuit back inside his pocket he and harry followed griphook toward one of the door leading off the hall what s the you know what in vault seven hundred and thir teen harry asked can t tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledore s trusted me more n my job s worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them harry who had ex pected more marble wa surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torch it sloped steeply down ward and there were little railway track on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the track toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passage harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it wa impossible the rattling cart seemed to know it own way because griphook wasn t steering harry s eye stung a the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it wa a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactite and stalagmite grew from the ceiling and floor i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart what s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite s got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me question just now i think i m gon na be sick diagon alley he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knee from trembling griphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billow ing out and a it cleared harry gasped inside were mound of gold coin column of silver heap of little bronze knut all yours smiled hagrid all harry s it wa incredible the dursleys couldn t have known about this or they d have had it from him faster than blink ing how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag the gold one are galleon he explained seventeen silver sickle to a galleon and twenty nine knut to a sickle it s easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o term we ll keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder a they hurtled round tight corner they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what wa down at the dark bottom but ha grid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long finger and it simply melted away chapter five if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that they d be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook how often do you check to see if anyone s inside harry asked about once every ten year said griphook with a rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry wa sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewel at the very least but at first he thought it wa empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it wa but knew better than to ask come on back in this infernal cart and don t talk to me on the way back it s best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didn t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didn t have to know how many galleon there were to a pound to know that he wa holding more money than he d had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had might a well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkin s robe for all occasion listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick me up in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts cart he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkin s shop alone feeling nervous madam malkin wa a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve diagon alley hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face wa standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robe madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry my father s next door buying my book and mother s up the street looking at wand said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then i m going to drag them off to look at racing broom i don t see why first year can t have their own i think i ll bully fa ther into getting me one and i ll smuggle it in somehow harry wa strongly reminded of dudley have you got your own broom the boy went on no said harry play quidditch at all no harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could be i do father say it s a crime if i m not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house you ll be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute well no one really know until they get there do they but i know i ll be in slytherin all our family have been imagine be ing in hufflepuff i think i d leave wouldn t you chapter five mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid wa standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice cream to show he couldn t come in that s hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didn t he work at hogwarts oh said the boy i ve heard of him he s a sort of servant isn t he he s the gamekeeper said harry he wa liking the boy less and less every second yes exactly i heard he s a sort of savage life in a hut on the school ground and every now and then he get drunk try to do magic and end up setting fire to his bed i think he s brilliant said harry coldly do you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parent they re dead said harry shortly he didn t feel much like go ing into the matter with this boy oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind weren t they they were a witch and wizard if that s what you mean i really don t think they should let the other sort in do you they re just not the same they ve never been brought up to know our way some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding family what s your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said that s you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talk ing to the boy hopped down from the footstool well i ll see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy harry wa rather quiet a he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nut what s up said hagrid nothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quill harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color a you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid what s quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch don t make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkin s and he said people from muggle family shouldn t even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family if he d known who yeh were he s grown up knowin yer name if his parent are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron wa like when they saw yeh anyway what doe he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only one with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch it s our sport wizard sport it s like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomstick and there s four ball sorta hard ter explain the rule chapter five and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school house there s four everyone say hufflepuff are a lot o duffer but i bet i m in hufflepuff said harry gloomily better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly there s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn t in slytherin you know who wa one vol sorry you know who wa at hogwarts year an year ago said hagrid they bought harry s school book in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelf were stacked to the ceiling with book a large a paving stone bound in leather book the size of postage stamp in cover of silk book full of peculiar symbol and a few book with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hand on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curse and counter curse bewitch your friend and befuddle your enemy with the latest revenge hair loss jelly leg tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian i wa trying to find out how to curse dudley i m not sayin that s not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstance said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curse yet yeh ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldn t let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it say pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scale for weigh ing potion ingredient and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which wa fascinating enough to make up diagon alley for it horrible smell a mixture of bad egg and rotted cabbage barrel of slimy stuff stood on the floor jar of herb dried root and bright powder lined the wall bundle of feather string of fang and snarled claw hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic po tion ingredient for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horn at twenty one galleon each and minuscule glittery black beetle eye five knut a scoop outside the apothecary hagrid checked harry s list again just yer wand left oh yeah an i still haven t got yeh a birth day present harry felt himself go red you don t have to i know i don t have to tell yeh what i ll get yer animal not a toad toad went outta fashion year ago yeh d be laughed at an i don like cat they make me sneeze i ll get yer an owl all the kid want owl they re dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minute later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewel bright eye harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldn t stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect you ve had a lotta present from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wand ollivanders and yeh got ta have the best wand a magic wand this wa what harry had been really looking forward to chapter five the last shop wa narrow and shabby peeling gold letter over the door read ollivanders maker of fine wand since b c a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depth of the shop a they stepped inside it wa a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely a though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new question that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousand of narrow box piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there wa a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair an old man wa standing before them his wide pale eye shin ing like moon through the gloom of the shop hello said harry awkwardly ah yes said the man yes yes i thought i d be seeing you soon harry potter it wasn t a question you have your mother s eye it seems only yesterday she wa in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inch long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eye were a bit creepy your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inch pliable a little more power and excellent for trans figuration well i say your father favored it it s really the wand that chooses the wizard of course diagon alley mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eye and that s where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry s forehead with a long white finger i m sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly thirteen and a half inch yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hand well if i d known what that wand wa going out into the world to do he shook his head and then to harry s relief spotted hagrid rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inch rather bendy wasn t it it wa sir yes said hagrid good wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his foot i ve still got the piece though he added brightly but you don t use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sir said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly a he spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape mea sure with silver marking out of his pocket which is your wand arm er well i m right handed said harry hold out your arm that s it he measured harry from shoul der to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head a he measured he said every ollivander chapter five wand ha a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hair phoenix tail feather and the heartstrings of dragon no two ollivander wand are the same just a no two unicorn dragon or phoenix are quite the same and of course you will never get such good result with another wizard s wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which wa mea suring between his nostril wa doing this on it own mr olli vander wa flitting around the shelf taking down box that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beech wood and dragon heartstring nine inch nice and flexible just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once maple and phoenix feather seven inch quite whippy try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too wa snatched back by mr ollivander no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inch springy go on go on try it out harry tried and tried he had no idea what mr ollivander wa waiting for the pile of tried wand wa mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wand mr ollivander pulled from the shelf the happier he seemed to become tricky customer eh not to worry we ll find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inch nice and supple diagon alley harry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his finger he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold spark shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spot of light on to the wall hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious he put harry s wand back into it box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curious sorry said harry but what s curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare i remember every wand i ve ever sold mr potter every single wand it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other it is very curious in deed that you should be destined for this wand when it brother why it brother gave you that scar harry swallowed yes thirteen and a half inch yew curious indeed how these thing happen the wand chooses the wizard remember i think we must expect great thing from you mr potter after all he who must not be named did great thing terrible yes but great harry shivered he wasn t sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleon for his wand and mr olli vander bowed them from his shop the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky a harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall chapter five back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didn t speak at all a they walked down the road he didn t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden a they were with all their funny shaped package with the snowy owl asleep in it cage on harry s lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when ha grid tapped him on the shoulder got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaf he said he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seat to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehow you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid harry wasn t sure he could explain he d just had the best birth day of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the word everyone think i m special he said at last all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but i don t know anything about magic at all how can they expect great thing i m famous and i can t even remember what i m famous for i don t know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parent died hagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eye brow he wore a very kind

yeh ll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smat ter of fact diagon alley hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope yer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september king s cross it s all on yer ticket any problem with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl she ll know where to find me see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch ha grid until he wa out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone c h a p t e r s i x the journey from h platform nine and three quarter arry s last month with the dursleys wasn t fun true dudley wa now so scared of harry he wouldn t stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didn t shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didn t speak to him at all half terrified half furious they acted a though any chair with harry in it were empty although this wa an improvement in many way it did be come a bit depressing after a while harry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school book were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window a she pleased it wa lucky that aunt petunia didn t come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mouse every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off the journey from platform nine and three quarter another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall count ing down to september the first on the last day of august he thought he d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king s cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he wa there and dudley screamed and ran from the room er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he wa listening er i need to be at king s cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt harry supposed that meant yes thank you he wa about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke funny way to get to a wizard school the train magic carpet all got puncture have they harry didn t say anything where is this school anyway i don t know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket i just take the train from platform nine and three quarter at eleven o clock he read his aunt and uncle stared platform what nine and three quarter chapter six don t talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and three quarter it s on my ticket barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them you ll see you just wait all right we ll take you to king s cross we re going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldn t bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep thing friendly taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he go to smeltings harry woke at five o clock the next morning and wa too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jean because he didn t want to walk into the station in his wizard s robe he d change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig wa shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hour later harry s huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off they reached king s cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harry s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this wa strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platform with a nasty grin on his face well there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they don t seem to have built it yet do they the journey from platform nine and three quarter he wa quite right of course there wa a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away all three of them were laughing harry s mouth went rather dry what on earth wa he going to do he wa starting to attract a lot of funny look because of hedwig he d have to ask someone he stopped a passing guard but didn t dare mention platform nine and three quarter the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn t even tell him what part of the country it wa in he started to get annoyed a though harry wa being stu pid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven o clock but the guard said there wasn t one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time waster harry wa now trying hard not to panic according to the large clock over the arrival board he had ten minute left to get on the train to hog wart and he had no idea how to do it he wa stranded in the mid dle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector s stand between platform nine and ten at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few word of what they were saying packed with muggles of course chapter six harry swung round the speaker wa a plump woman who wa talking to four boy all with flaming red hair each of them wa pushing a trunk like harry s in front of him and they had an owl heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were say ing now what s the platform number said the boy mother nine and three quarter piped a small girl also red headed who wa holding her hand mom can t i go you re not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platform nine and ten harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just a the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platform a large crowd of tourist came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished fred you next the plump woman said i m not fred i m george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother can t you tell i m george sorry george dear only joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so be cause a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother wa walking briskly toward the barrier he wa almost there and then quite suddenly he wasn t any where the journey from platform nine and three quarter there wa nothing else for it excuse me harry said to the plump woman hello dear she said first time at hogwarts ron s new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her son he wa tall thin and gangling with freckle big hand and foot and a long nose yes said harry the thing is the thing is i don t know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded not to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platform nine and ten don t stop and don t be scared you ll crash into it that s very important best do it at a bit of a run if you re nervous go on go now before ron er okay said harry he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solid he started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platform nine and ten harry walked more quickly he wa going to smash right into that barrier and then he d be in trouble lean ing forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier wa coming nearer and nearer he wouldn t be able to stop the cart wa out of control he wa a foot away he closed his eye ready for the crash it didn t come he kept on running he opened his eye a scarlet steam engine wa waiting next to a platform packed with people a

aminatou welcome to call your girlfriend ann a podcast for long distance besties everywhere aminatou i m aminatou sow ann and i m ann friedman aminatou hey ann friedman ann love that i just quickly swallowed a mouthful of popcorn in order to do this intro aminatou laugh ann so you know we ve really gotten casual about podcasting aminatou i know there s popcorn water around the table ann there s snack yeah aminatou there s snack it s cool i m excited about today s show ann tell me aminatou i spoke to nora mcinerny the author of no happy ending and the host of terrible thanks for asking a podcast that i really really really love she s on this week to talk about a lot of thing that are central to her work so mostly grief dealing with grief and being a resilient person and moving on and just living in a world where everything is really fucking hard like truly truly truly one of my favorite conversation and i ve been thinking a lot about you know how joy and tragedy are they re just like a part of life you ll be so lucky to be joyful in your life but you will experience tragedy ann ugh zen master aminatou sow aminatou let me tell you and just like you know it s like life is really hard these day or at least for me it is so having somebody who think about these thing a lot and ha been really generous about talking about their own grief and their own experience with losing people that are close to them and still having to put one foot in front of the other every day that s something i really appreciate and making some space to actually talk about grief it really confounds me how little we talk about it when tragedy is literally like it s happening right now so ann right every day is the worst day of someone s life aminatou you know what ann you should write that book i love it laugh but it s true and it is truly shocking that we don t talk about it enough and then the people who do talk about it then kind of become avatar for always talking about hard like they don t get to be three dimensional people theme song aminatou i think you re going to enjoy it ann i can t wait another midwest diva aminatou you know another midwest diva with great hair so here s nora interview start nora i m nora mcinerny i am a podcast host which is like the version of saying you re a blogger laugh aminatou rude rude nora nora who isn t a podcaster sorry i m nora mcinerny i m severely depressed right now but i m on my way up i can tell i m like hitting whatever the opposite of a crest is where you re like okay now i know now i know i m on the upswing but still i m a podcaster i also have a podcast with american public medium called terrible thanks for asking and i m the author of some funny sad book that basically all come down to the fact that i am a widow i wa widowed at and that is kind of a strangely central part of my identity even though i would ve preferred to just be known a like nora s really tall aminatou you are very tall nora you re very tall nora i m very tall aminatou and your hair is beautiful i wish those were the thing you re known for nora thank you same but i like you know this is my new version so aminatou well i have so many question talk to me about being depressed today how s that going nora god uh i mean it s been kind of a while and i m learning to sort of just okay basically what i think it all the root of it currently is just a lot of anxiety about making thing i don t know if you are familiar with being a woman who make thing you know aminatou no never heard of that condition nora never heard aminatou never heard of that condition nora it s a very it s rare but when you are a woman who make thing that are important to you and then you put them out into the world it doe come with a certain amount of anxiety that i think mostly i can kind of compartmentalize but often i can t because it s sort of all tied in with the thing you re making is tied in with your income and tied in with your identity and in obvious way that i ve seen you address on social medium also sort of tied in with your likability and the internet giveth u a platform and it taketh away some really basic part of our humanity which is just basically letting people kind of live and let live and not being subjected to everybody s opinion about your life and sometimes currently right before you called i wa on craigslist looking up camper and wondering if i could relocate a family of six to a forest and live in a camper it s not looking great but that s just where i am mentally aminatou yeah you need a lot of space i m going to say this i imagine that camper add like to anxiety and depression so i m just going to say i m not a medical doctor but i m going to say that this is not a great idea nora it s not a great idea but just looking i think kind of help just looking at a different version of your life is kind of a form of therapy for me and so right now i just also feel depressed that i m not grateful enough or appreciative enough of the thing that i m able to do if you would ve told me five year ago oh you ll have written three book and you ll have four kid i would ve been like oh yes then i ll be happy but there is a kind of central conflict in this story which is the way that i got here which is really hard and it s really hard to live with that sort of both and thinking therapy word for you where i do have this i have work that i really love doing and i have a family i love and also to get here i lost my husband aaron and i lost the second baby that we were hoping to have and i lost my dad all at once and now i m here and it wasn t a trade one for the other or three for four but i am here in this really happy place but it wa a complicated way to get here and that s really hard to i think sometimes manage day to day aminatou will you tell me about your new book no happy ending what is it about why did you write it why is it so good nora i wrote this book okay so the first book god i m so good at elevator pitch if you want to ride the willie wonka elevator for nine year aminatou laugh nora so i wrote this book in the aftermath of losing my first husband which is also what my first book is about my first book wa written in the six month after aaron died and when i say that now it sound absolutely bonkers but i m so glad i wrote it because being close to something is a perspective and being in something is a perspective and it is that is a chaotic book and one that i will always love because i could ve written it from a nice safe distance i could ve written it ten year later and had a really good sense of what it all meant but i didn t and i still don t have a sense of what it all meant but since aaron died i did meet another man and i got pregnant and fell in love and we got married in that order the perception that i get and that i ve gotten ever since that first book came out and a people have followed me on instagram or come to book event is i wish that i wa doing better with this hard thing i went through i wish i wa doing more like you and that is so devastating to me because am i doing well and what doe it mean to do well and why do we think that these formative life event these really really difficult thing are thing that we are meant to move on from and not move forward with when i met matthew the overwhelming response from people wa essentially oh my god thank god we don t have to worry about her anymore like what a happy ending he s divorced and ha two kid she s a widow and ha one kid now they re going to have another baby they ve got a house out in the suburb what could be better well the fact is i do have a pretty amazing family honestly all the kid are the best they re all healthy and kind and matthew is a wonderful human and he s so different from aaron but they re sort of complementary force in my life but i m not done with aaron just because i met matthew and the fact is that all of these child have come from a broken place and so it s not an ending it s not an ending for any of u matthew s first wife life close to u like we see her at soccer game and aaron and his family are still a part of our life these are all experience that we carry with u forever so i don t want people to look at my life and see it a a destination aminatou right it s like people just think that you know it s like you close one chapter you move on to the next and that s not how grief work you know laugh nora no it s not how life work aminatou it is just not how it work nora no amina you right you beat cancer good thing you never think about cancer ever again because you beat it aminatou never nora because you re a champ because you re a warrior aminatou i didn t wake up cry about it this morning at all that s not what happened nora no it s so over in the word of hilary duff it s so yesterday and you have not even thought about it anybody who ha actually experienced something in life know that know that that is a part of you and that they have been made to feel a if it shouldn t be and a if they should have left it behind them and that is a huge tension it is a huge thing that everybody explores in therapy because it isn t true and so this is a book with all of those contradiction in it it is a book about me being really happy and grateful and also deeply deeply grief stricken especially in a time when i felt truly like legally obligated to be nothing but happy and nothing but grateful you know any time you try to act a way that you think other people think that you should feel is a real recipe for success i have to tell you aminatou laugh yeah nora any mental health professional will be like ask everyone else how you should feel and then feel that way aminatou i know my therapist is screaming what helped you get out like really shake that feeling off though because i think there are so few model for how you are supposed to experience grief like i remember when my mom died like i didn t understand why the whole world didn t stop to cater to me you know at some point i still kind of don t understand it in regard to that nora aminatou to that specific thing but i really think that the thing that probably messed me up more than anything else is we don t talk about loss and grief a a thing that you are continuously supposed to experience right it s like every culture ha their own grieving ritual and then you re supposed to come back into the real world nora right aminatou it s like you re a leper for a while and then you come back into the real world and then now your life is fine and so i m wondering how you shake those feeling away nora well an american culture which i don t even know if you can call it that but it s like the funeral industrial complex ha boiled that down to a five day window where someone dy and then you re really busy planning a funeral like this is a non denominational areligious sort of variety and then everybody come to maybe a wake and a funeral and then it s over and even if you belong to a faith system or a culture that ha a longer grief support or grief ritual you still are forced to fit that into your company s hr policy which i hope every listener review because it s garbage legally i m pretty sure that when aaron died i had like three day of leave for a spouse and i mean i obviously took more than that well i quit my job but i wa like i ll take all the day aminatou laugh you re like i m going to take every single day that is available to me which is every day nora yeah but it s it s so hard it s hard to shake that if truly the rest of the world and anyone who s have you ever the last time you were at a funeral and you re in this really intense moment and then you leave and you re in a car or you re on the train and you look around you like how are all these people just living their life how do they not know what just happened and i don t know that i ve shaken that feeling i am still currently shaking that feeling and therapy helped and writing the book helped and this job of mine these job of mine where i have terrible thanks for asking and i have still kicking which is a non profit i started when aaron died and we just give no string attached financial grant to people who are going through something hard i really have surrounded myself all day with people who are going through something difficult so i am reminded every day it s not over for them it s not over for me and we are all walking around wounded and trying to hide it aminatou i mean i think the thing that i appreciate about you so much and the many many many many people who listen to you is that you are so real about you know talking about all sort of emotional catastrophe and really being you know not sugarcoating any of it and feeling all of your feeling and really talking about the fact that painful experience are inevitable right it s just a thing that everybody will face even though it seems like some people s life are very charmed i will say you and i are not people with charmed life laugh so it seems to me that you know part of the answer and part of just working through all of this is talking about it more nora oh absolutely and i do think you know pain and suffering are universal and also so individual so anybody that you think ha a charmed life could tell you a story that you have no idea about i think if somebody follows you immediately on instagram they think oh wow look at this this lady ha it all look at all these follower and this popular podcast and she s got a book deal i get that too and i m like but wait there s more and there s always more you and i have not filled up our punch card nor ha anybody else it s just this is life doing what life doe which is force u to suffer and then in between these really tragic moment is the good stuff which is really any time something is not actively falling apart i have learned to acknowledge that is actually kind of the best part of life aminatou laugh nora is when thing are like if i can live at a five a five to a six then i m actually having a pretty good life aminatou oh my god nora i do not need exquisite happiness i need for thing to just not be awful aminatou i mean that is my exquisite happiness if i m honest nora yeah aminatou i really want to go back to this thing though that you talked about you know like people peering into your social medium or into your life and feeling that everything is okay doesn t that drive you a little bit up the wall though because the line the tension is there right it s like it s the people peer in because they want to see how you are living but also if you are constantly falling apart in front of them very publicly that s not something that keep them around nora right that s not palatable that s not palatable at all and i think the strange thing too that i ve witnessed is that i did not set and i have a modest what i consider because you know internet fame ha several level right so i m a person who ha like maybe instagram follower which to some people is a lot and to some people is like huh call me when you have a million aminatou laugh nora but that wa never like that s not a goal of mine i really really sort of struggle with this because it is in some way it s been such a cool thing and such a cool way to connect with people and in some way i can see it is an absolute poison for our society and particularly for woman and there s so much that is encouraging really pressuring woman and it come from other woman who this is their business model is to make you feel like you should be doing more and that they can show you how to do it and why am i begrudging woman what men have been doing forever which is basically scamming aminatou basically nora but it really is and i m like i guess i shouldn t begrudge you except that you are then perpetuating this feeling among woman that it s not enough to just have a job and have friend and be reasonably happy and do your own thing no you have to hustle you have to have a side hustle you have a night hustle and in between hustle you have to do more and be more and honestly you don t like you don t have to write a book to be a writer you don t have to have a podcast to have something to say and you don t have to have a side hustle like whatever you are doing is probably enough and if you want to do something else you can do it just for you and not for instagram aminatou well that s a word if i ve ever heard one ad aminatou what doe the world look like if we make room and space for the fact it is complicated and that it is you know that you can have both big and small devastation every single day nora yeah and that it s not it s not limited to i kind of almost set aside day where i wa like oh i will definitely be sad on aaron s birthday i will definitely be sad on aaron s deathaversary there s no way for me to set aside the kind of moment where i see somebody who i swear it s aaron and i m driving down the street and i see him and he s walking down the street and he s like he s still and he s riding a scooter and it s him and i just think like oh there he is like how great i don t think like oh no and then the realization hit then i realize oh no that s not him that s just somebody else who look a lot like him like there s no way to plan for those thing there s no way to plan for watching people that he worked with get promotion that maybe he would ve gotten if he would ve lived and there s no way of planning for i mean this man wa truly aaron wa so funny and so into celebrity gossip i went to who weekly live shout out to all our fellow wholigans aminatou love it nora and i brought matthew and matthew s never heard of a celebrity but he laughed a lot because bobby and lindsey are so funny but i kept thinking like aaron would ve made a podcast like this he wa so funny and he reminds me of a straight bobby finger aminatou wow what a world laugh nora what a world and there s no way to plan for those kind of thing right to be like or you see something and you re like oh my god this woman is being my mom right now aminatou yeah it just yeah you re right you can not you can t plan it for me i never the deathaversaries are not that big a deal anymore i think it s been year year like that s how much that s how long it s been that i don t quit remember the year anymore nora yeah aminatou and so the thing that used to be trigger are no longer trigger that s fine but yeah it s like something wild will happen in the news and i ll be like well you know wish we could ve shared that or one of my friend will be a complete see you next tuesday to their mom and all i know is that now i m always on the side of the mom that s the friend that i ve turned into if you are having a conflict with your mother i am squarely on your mother s side every single time laugh nora mag appreciates that aminatou it s just dumb stuff like that and obviously time make it more complicated and longer and so much of how we deal with people that are grieving is to provide them support in the first hour and the truth is that s actually not when you need people the most and it s not when you need your pain acknowledged the most but i also think that people like you surprise yourself like it wa interesting to hear you say that you are you know widow is your primary identity i m like you know my mom died is my number one identity and i think sometimes it make people really uncomfortable how much i talk about it but i secretly love talking about it nora good aminatou i secretly love talking about it and making them very uncomfortable so it s also fine nora yeah and also because one day that will be their identifier aminatou oh are you kidding ugh this is so morbid but it s actually like that s the best part nora yeah and honestly it s like you are giving them a kindness that they may not recognize yet but i think about that all the time i m like hey i m just showing you that i m basically giving you an instruction manual for when it happens to you because it will aminatou sigh like what a it s so funny though it s so funny because obviously everybody cope with their loss differently and we obviously cope with it by telling very morbid story and the gallows humor is real i don t know how you teach that to people at scale like hey your life is going to be hard you might a well have one good last laugh about it because everything is going to fall apart someday nora we ve got to figure out how to scale it and monetize it okay aminatou right scale it monetize it that ll be the instagram it s like hello big disaster instagram please follow u nora please i don t know either because i grew up catholic sort of and they didn t teach me anything they taught me nothing no offense mom and any catholic who are listening but that aminatou i m on your mom s side they taught you everything okay you just were not paying attention laugh nora i honestly to be honest i said to one of my friend who went to grade school with me i wa like i mean i don t even think we opened a bible in school and she wa like yes we did idiot you just weren t paying attention aminatou laugh nora i m like oh well i never opened a bible aminatou yeah i m on your mom s side here nora i guess i wa sick that day aminatou catholic are very good about teaching suffering okay you were not paying attention nora yeah i think i just wasn t paying attention i just wasn t paying attention but there is a huge part of this i mentioned earlier you know what your hr policy is and that obviously only applies if you are a salaried employee but i mean what happens if you are self employed or if you re hourly or there s so many repercussion and my friend who started the hot young widow club with me which is a different thing that i do aminatou love it nora i ve got a lot of stuff a lot of stuff that doesn t make me money going on but we have this group called the hot young widow club and mo is like she doe hair and her husband died by suicide and two day later she wa cutting hair because if she doesn t cut hair she doesn t get paid and if she doesn t get paid who pay the mortgage and that is the reality of grief is so many people are walking around traumatized and without a way to process it and without access to mental healthcare and even if it were affordable when would you go when would you go if you are an only parent and your work schedule is grueling and you can t get in for an appointment at a m across town so it s so complicated and the more you experience it the more you realize like oh there are so many reason why so many of u are so hurt for so long and it s not just that we have not washed our face and pulled our bootstrap up and gotten over it it s that there are big big barrier to this and we do not have any more like a real sort of sense of a real community that will really really really hold you up like that is a very very very rare thing and this is coming from a middle class white lady in the midwest who i got to move back in with my mom that wa made available to me and that is not available to everybody so basically i did have another grown up to help me but my mom wa also grief stricken and i love her so much and there wa only so much she could do too it s just a lot and so if you are a person who ha gone through something really difficult and you re like ugh why am i not doing better at this because it s hard because it s hard and sometimes hard thing are just hard and maybe there s a silver lining but it s not your job to find it that s not your number one priority right now is to get to the sunny side of the street it s to just hold on through this monsoon like grab onto something solid whatever you can and get through it and if you are a person who is adjacent to a person who ha gone through something really difficult hold on too because it is going to be a while and they are not fine aminatou oh it s going to be a while it s probably going to be your whole life nora yeah aminatou i think there s just this idea and i think in america it s so specific this way that you re just supposed to get over stuff really quickly and when you get over it it s supposed to be you re supposed to always find a silver lining there s some sort of victorious narrative that you give you know you beat cancer you get over your grief we re always just warrior for something nora you remarry like ugh so great aminatou it s awful it s just it s so awful it s like maybe we should learn to sit with suffering a little bit you should learn to sit with it a lot of u are it s like if you re listening to this on a podcast you probably have a lot more privilege than other people who are suffering around the world you know not to make this some sort of privilege olympics but i do think that suffering give you nora but i win i do win i get the gold aminatou i don t know how to tell you this i win i win if we re playing this game or rather i lose so you win you re right nora laugh aminatou but you know what i mean it s like sitting with suffering is i m not saying that it s good but it give you a little bit of perspective about what is going on in your world and what is going on in the world i wish that that s something that wa a value and a virtue that we were taught you know it should just be like okay thing are really hard and you re going to have to learn to be a resilient person you re going to have to learn to be somebody who understands suffering who is empathetic to it and instead all we re taught is to shut down the terrible feeling a soon a it happens you re supposed to move on very quickly nora oh yeah aminatou and that s it own sickness and that also contributes to this just general unease about everything nora mm hmm and that you should try to have you read bright sided by barbara ehrenreich aminatou no should i should i add another book to the pile nora oh god you should you should it s so good and she wrote it after he breast cancer diagnosis when she s basically inundated with positive thinking and all of that language that is definitely very very tied to a cancer diagnosis but a people our reflex is to try to fix it for somebody and not everything is fixable and it is also not in your ability to fix everything and so sitting with someone else s discomfort is usually sitting with your own discomfort and trying to override that reflex to say i know what you mean or to say have you done this or to sort of rush to fill a silence and i know our jewish brother and sister have a brief tradition called shiva and you sit quietly with the berieved and they talk if they want to talk and you talk about whatever they want to talk about and i m sure i m oversimplifying it but the idea of just being present for somebody and letting them set the tone for it is really powerful and it doe not have to just be limited to somebody s death but to i mean to a friend who is going through a divorce to a friend who is struggling to conceive there are so many way for life to kick you in the neck you would be surprised you won t be surprised it will never stop but what you need is not for somebody to try to fix it for you but you need somebody there in the suffering with you anybody can be with you in your happiness that is a very light lift a far a friendship go so i have a social circle that look way different now than it did when aaron wa alive like very different and that hurt me for a long time and i now see a part of that wa me a part of that wa i just could not say to people how much it hurt and what i needed from them because i really didn t know and i didn t know how to not be okay because i wa a person who could get through anything and i had spent three year of aaron being sick just taking care of it and taking care of him and trying not to be somebody s sad story nobody want your pity and if you ve gotten pity you know it s gross it is gross like pity is the opposite of empathy and it is very easy to feel bad for somebody and it s harder to feel with somebody aminatou i mean whew this is making me feel a lot of thing you know i think that you re right the central tension i think that is there especially for friend that are going through this kind of stuff especially when we re all young and dumb nora ugh true yes aminatou because that s also you know that s also part of our story is that we re something and something and the thing with friend is so real because a lot of people just want to fix thing the minute that you voice some sort of discomfort or you re unhappy the tendency is to fix thing and the thing you know when somebody dy there s nothing to fix we re just going to have to sit here and be very uncomfortable and be very upset about it there is truly nothing to fix like the worst ha happened and you know also just to go back to that thing that you were talking about with the bright sided book which i m going to put on my list but it really made me think about part of what is so gross about this positive thinking narrative is the underbelly of it is saying that whenever anything bad happens to you it s your fault nora ding ding ding aminatou it s like if you can t think your way out of all of it and that is you know i wa like talk about just bullshit and that add more to the pity that you feel from other people it add more to your inadequacy about voicing your own need and your want when you are going through something uncomfortable and it s all so gross it s so gross it is so gross to tell people that you know someone dying or their being ill or even a relationship failing it s like it s not your fault life happens nora yeah exactly and these are not exception to the rule like these are the rule which is that every single person you know is going to die and every single person you know is going to suffer and so will you and we do not get to choose when it happens or how it happens otherwise i would ve chosen much lighter thing for sure aminatou laugh nora i m lazy i would ve been like um i guess i would lose maybe a finger aminatou you re like that s what i can contribute to the cause really a finger nora yeah aminatou i don t know i m too vain to lose a finger i think nora yeah maybe not maybe not even a finger maybe part of an ear because i could wear my hair down aminatou not even not even i would do like a tiny bald spot maybe that i could cover up maybe nora i can t afford a bald spot i can t aminatou maybe maybe nora i ve got real fine baby hair a bald spot would basically be my whole head so aminatou you could wear a wig you could wear a wig nora that s true they ve gotten so good aminatou everybody ha their own suffering how much of your brain do you think brainpower is spent thinking about death nora i mean it s kind of always there in the background but honestly not in a morbid way i do think that to explore some cliche here that aminatou love a clich tell me love a clich nora yeah like my fear of death is really is gone i do not fear dying at all i watched my dad die i watched aaron die and i just had real realization moment where if it were a movie you would zoom in on my pupil and inside would be the whole universe aminatou laugh nora and i just get it i m like oh my god it all make sense and then schoop it s over that s how fast it happened and how intense it wa and i wa like oh i m okay he s okay we re okay and then obviously the shock wear off and then you do feel pain for a long time but for that brief moment i wa like i get it i get it and i m no longer afraid of dying i m no longer afraid of it and i wa born afraid of dying i wa just aminatou oh my god me too it s all i thought about a a kid nora oh yes aminatou my every action wa driven by how afraid i wa of dying and now i m like i don t care nora yeah now i m like you know what it ll be fine i m still afraid of suffering i have to say you know watching aaron die slowly of brain cancer i thought if i have brain cancer i will move to a state that ha right to die legislation and i will decide when i m done doing this because it s not a good death it s not a peaceful death it s a violent horrible death and that is something that i think about all the time a part of me is always aware of that of the potential for suffering among the people that i love but i m not afraid of my own death i know that really death is hard for the people who survive it that s who it s hard on and i do want to raise kid who are not afraid of what will become of them without me or without their dad and i have one kid who ha a dead dad and that is something that we honestly we talk about aaron every day and so i do think that that s helpful for all of the kid you know the big kid they never met aaron obviously but they know him they know story about him from high school that i ve told they know his favorite color they can tell you the way that he used to make fun of me that i really miss and now they do and so i hope that that is a comfort to them in some way that talking about somebody s death doe not need to be morose and doe not need to be or talking about a dead person i should say because the person you love who is dead is so much more than their death is so much more than the way that they died and i want to be able to tell you that aaron would ve started who weekly no offense bobby and lindsey i want to be able to tell you about our wedding without you being like oh god i m so sorry oh when will she stop talking about this i want to be able to hear about your mom that s the kind of that s the kind of world i want and that s the kind of kid i want to raise i want ralph to be able to say oh yeah one of my dad is dead one of my dad is shorter than his driver s license say aminatou laugh no need to air out family business on this podcast nora do you have an ideal scenario for what you want your funeral to be nora oh okay so first of all i do oh i have another book recommendation for the audience have you read from here to eternity aminatou no thank you for telling the entire audience that i don t read book thank you for coming on the show and making me sound like an illiterate person laugh nora you are the most you are the most well read person that i ve ever met truly besides my dead dad but he only read dead white people so wa he even that well read i don t know more family drama on the next episode of talking shit about dead people aminatou laugh nora but it s a book by caitlin doughty who s a mortician in l a and advocate for natural burial and against all of the sort of death industry stuff and it wa really beautiful and i wa like oh my god there s just so much beautiful ritual around the world i do want to be cremated i would like life size cutout of myself from various life phase that can be around for people to pose with keep in their home afterward that wa an idea that wa actually aaron s but we couldn t pull it off which i feel bad about sorry aaron and i loved aaron s funeral and we had his favorite dessert and we had too much alcohol i will say and it wa at night it wa an evening event and we had music and we had people talk that s what i want i want there to be some ritual although nothing there s really nothing from the christian tradition that really resonates with me funeral wise i still have some funeral planning to do so that s a good reminder aminatou okay let s work on our funeral planning nora yeah aminatou it s all i think about i don t i m not big into my birthday and i don t like like my nightmare nora i hate my birthday aminatou my actual nightmare is somebody throwing me a surprise birthday party like that s my nightmare nora oh my god yes aminatou one time it almost happened like this person almost threw a party and then my very close friend were like you re amina will hate this she didn t get it she wa a newish friend she didn t get it and then finally they had to tell me so i would break it to her i wa like listen you can not throw this party for me all of this to say is my dream is a surprise funeral when i m alive because laugh i m saying it now so that my friend who are listening will really take this to heart nora yes aminatou sometime in the next three decade i would really appreciate this party because the thing nora oh i love that aminatou i brag all the time on this show about how i don t have fomo and the truth is the only thing i will ever have fomo about is my own funeral because that sound like my it s like my nightmare scenario of a party all of my friend from all of the part of my life meeting unsupervised and talking about me i don t think so that s banana nora laugh aminatou so i think all of my obsession with funeral planning is really that i wa like you re an anal retentive asshole like me and you plan out every single part of this then it s almost like you re there nora yeah that s so smart it s so smart i knew of a person who did like they had a pre funeral that they attended and i thought that wa really sweet god that s such a good idea that s a really good idea yeah you don t get to attend your own funeral and honestly you know a lot of the stuff that happens if you ve ever planned a funeral with a family you re like is this what the person wanted i hope it is uh i don t know then you re doing thing that you re like i think they would really hate this but so much of it is for the living people and that s kind of b aminatou i know funeral for the living people and also i have not had a wedding so i don t know what it s like to just have people buy you gift and toast you so i think the closest i will get to that is my own amazing funeral and i d like to know what the speech are nora oh yes oh i agree i also do think that we a a society should probably more embrace registry for thing beyond just a wedding especially because so many people are getting married when they already have the resource to buy their own gd dish okay aminatou i know i know i wa invited to a very like to somebody who wa getting remarried also who wa very wealthy and i couldn t believe that they had ice cream dish on their registry and i let them know about it it s like i m sorry you re not allowed to ask for this this is ridiculous this is a second wedding you have a lot of money nora yeah i didn t have a wedding registry i think the first time aaron and i had one on amazon and he put video game on it and snow shoe aminatou that s genius that s genius that s actually genius you should ask for what you want but i do agree with you that a small part of this figuring out this puzzle is celebrating thing that are not just like the dumb accomplishment that you re supposed to have like wedding i always say that getting married is not an accomplishment nora it is not an accomplishment neither is getting engaged aminatou no and that s very nice nora completely agree aminatou it s very nice but i think that if we made it a normal part of life to celebrate and grieve big and small thing and to put everything into context you know i want to see wedding energy go into funeral and go into you know like helping your friend who are ill or dealing with people who are facing a really bad diagnosis or people who are going through divorce let s keep that same energy throughout all of these life milestone and then we don t make people feel like shit when life actually happens nora yes yes aminatou death is a normal part of life divorce is a normal part of life this is all normal and you know not to conflate nora yes losing a job do you know how many people message me and they re like i lost a job and i feel like a loser my life is over i m like no no no welcome aminatou talk about a registry that s who we should have registry for like people getting laid off from job are you serious nora exactly exactly okay this is also a good idea so let s bookmark all of these great idea aminatou yes let s monetize all of this in the future it all sound so scary and terrifying but isn t this what life is made of people were doing this before u just like having kid and then figuring it out later nora yes exactly and also my dad wa a huge advocate for not trying to plan out your life and he wa very much annoyed by people saying thing like oh we re just not quite at that stage yet he s like when do you think you ll be at a stage when you re ready to do anything you just have to do stuff he also coined the very uplifting phrase nobody give a shit about what you were going to do so stop talking and do it aminatou oh my god laugh that cured my depression this morning nora all right it s like no one give a shit like oh you were going to do something no just do the thing i do think that did come in handy i married aaron when he had a brain tumor a month after his brain surgery we were married like the scar wa still crusty and we got married and i accidentally got pregnant with matthew sorry kid a we listen to this episode a a family you know wa it time to have a baby turn out who care laugh that is it all work out or it doesn t i don t know aminatou just live your life just live your life nora just stay tuned for more inspirational aminatou just live your life nora yeah you literally can not plan it and i would never in a million year have found matthew on the internet with what i thought i wanted out of another relationship i would not have found aaron either i wa like i don t want to date any guy who work in advertising i work in advertising ugh gross all the guy who work in advertising are not for me if i would ve gone according to some arbitrary plan that wa obviously created before i d experienced any of these thing who know where i would be and i d still be thinking like oh what if what if aminatou well you know what good thing we don t have to ask ourselves what if because you did the damn thing nora and the other thing too is nothing we are doing is permanent right so you start call your girlfriend that s wonderful at any point you ann and gina can be like eh we can stop like it s not a if this is now you have signed on to always have a small business always like now you are small business people period that is it you are never allowed to do anything else so there s all this pressure that something ha to be everything to you and be everything to you forever and most of the thing that we are doing are not that high stake doe that make sense aminatou that make so much sense you can always lower the stake for everything in life nora you can like you can when i started still kicking it wa an llc because that wa the easiest form i could find on the internet then i gave the money away and my accountant wa like oh tax time where s the money and i wa like oh i gave it away do you even read and that s not a good business that s a non profit idiot aminatou laugh nora so quick pivot um aminatou love it nora quick pivot and a lot of money later but we figured it out you can grow and change with the thing you are doing with your life like life is growing and changing and not just waiting until you know everything to start something because then you ll never do anything aminatou ugh what a note to end on no happy ending is out and even though i ve read no other book nora ha talked about today i have read no happy ending and it is delightful nora thank you ugh that mean a lot to me interview end ann ugh she s the best aminatou see you on the internet boo boo ann see you on the internet aminatou
