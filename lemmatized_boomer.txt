modern world the catcher in the rye by j d salinger to my mother if you really want to hear about it the first thing you ll probably want to know is where i wa born an what my lousy childhood wa like and how my parent were occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i don t feel like going into it if you want to know the truth in the first place that stuff bore me and in the second place my parent would have about two hemorrhage apiece if i told anything pretty personal about them they re quite touchy about anything like that especially my father they re nice and all i m not saying that but they re also touchy a hell besides i m not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything i ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last christmas just before i got pretty run down and had to come out here and take it easy i mean that s all i told d b about and he s my brother and all he s in hollywood that isn t too far from this crumby place and he come over and visit me practically every week end he s going to drive me home when i go home next month maybe he just got a jaguar one of those little english job that can do around two hundred mile an hour it cost him damn near four thousand buck he s got a lot of dough now he didn t use to he used to be just a regular writer when he wa home he wrote this terrific book of short story the secret goldfish in case you never heard of him the best one in it wa the secret goldfish it wa about this little kid that wouldn t let anybody look at his goldfish because he d bought it with his own money it killed me now he s out in hollywood d b being a prostitute if there s one thing i hate it s the movie don t even mention them to me where i want to start telling is the day i left pencey prep pencey prep is this school that s in agerstown pennsylvania you probably heard of it you ve probably seen the ad anyway they advertise in about a thousand magazine always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence like a if all you ever did at pencey wa play polo all the time i never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place and underneath the guy on the horse s picture it always say since we have been molding boy into splendid clear thinking young men strictly for the bird they don t do any damn more molding at pencey than they do at any other school and i didn t know anybody there that wa splendid and clear thinking and all maybe two guy if that many and they probably came to pencey that way anyway it wa the saturday of the football game with saxon hall the game with saxon hall wa supposed to be a very big deal around pencey it wa the last game of the year and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old pencey didn t win i remember around three o clock that afternoon i wa standing way the hell up on top of thomsen hill right next to this crazy cannon that wa in the revolutionary war and all you could see the whole field from there and you could see the two team bashing each other all over the place you couldn t see the grandstand too hot but you could hear them all yelling deep and terrific on the pencey side because practically the whole school except me wa there and scrawny and faggy on the saxon hall side because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them there were never many girl at all at the football game only senior were allowed to bring girl with them it wa a terrible school no matter how you looked at it i like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girl around once in a while even if they re only scratching their arm or blowing their nose or even just giggling or something old selma thurmer she wa the headmaster s daughter showed up at the game quite often but she wasn t exactly the type that drove you mad with desire she wa a pretty nice girl though i sat next to her once in the bus from agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation i liked her she had a big nose and her nail were all bitten down and bleedy looking and she had on those damn falsie that point all over the place but you felt sort of sorry for her what i liked about her she didn t give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father wa she probably knew what a phony slob he wa the reason i wa standing way up on thomsen hill instead of down at the game wa because i d just got back from new york with the fencing team i wa the goddam manager of the fencing team very big deal we d gone in to new york that morning for this fencing meet with mcburney school only we didn t have the meet i left all the foil and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway it wasn t all my fault i had to keep getting up to look at this map so we d know where to get off so we got back to pencey around two thirty instead of around dinnertime the whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train it wa pretty funny in a way the other reason i wasn t down at the game wa because i wa on my way to say good by to old spencer my history teacher he had the grippe and i figured i probably wouldn t see him again till christmas vacation started he wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before i went home he knew i wasn t coming back to pencey i forgot to tell you about that they kicked me out i wasn t supposed to come back after christmas vacation on account of i wa flunking four subject and not applying myself and all they gave me frequent warning to start applying myself especially around midterm when my parent came up for a conference with old thurmer but i didn t do it so i got the ax they give guy the ax quite frequently at pencey it ha a very good academic rating pencey it really doe anyway it wa december and all and it wa cold a a witch s teat especially on top of that stupid hill i only had on my reversible and no glove or anything the week before that somebody d stolen my camel s hair coat right out of my room with my fur lined glove right in the pocket and all pencey wa full of crook quite a few guy came from these very wealthy family but it wa full of crook anyway the more expensive a school is the more crook it ha i m not kidding anyway i kept standing next to that crazy cannon looking down at the game and freezing my as off only i wasn t watching the game too much what i wa really hanging around for i wa trying to feel some kind of a good by i mean i ve left school and place i didn t even know i wa leaving them i hate that i don t care if it s a sad good by or a bad goodby but when i leave a place i like to know i m leaving it if you don t you feel even worse i wa lucky all of a sudden i thought of something that helped make me know i wa getting the hell out i suddenly remembered this time in around october that i and robert tichener and paul campbell were chucking a football around in front of the academic building they were nice guy especially tichener it wa just before dinner and it wa getting pretty dark out but we kept chucking the ball around anyway it kept getting darker and darker and we could hardly see the ball any more but we didn t want to stop doing what we were doing finally we had to this teacher that taught biology mr zambesi stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told u to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner if i get a chance to remember that kind of stuff i can get a good by when i need one at least most of the time i can a soon a i got it i turned around and started running down the other side of the hill toward old spencer s house he didn t live on the campus he lived on anthony wayne avenue i ran all the way to the main gate and then i waited a second till i got my breath i have no wind if you want to know the truth i m quite a heavy smoker for one thing that is i used to be they made me cut it out another thing i grew six and a half inch last year that s also how i practically got t b and came out here for all these goddam checkup and stuff i m pretty healthy though anyway a soon a i got my breath back i ran across route it wa icy a hell and i damn near fell down i don t even know what i wa running for i guess i just felt like it after i got across the road i felt like i wa sort of disappearing it wa that kind of a crazy afternoon terrifically cold and no sun out or anything and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road boy i rang that doorbell fast when i got to old spencer s house i wa really frozen my ear were hurting and i could hardly move my finger at all c mon c mon i said right out loud almost somebody open the door finally old mr spencer opened it they didn t have a maid or anything and they always opened the door themselves they didn t have too much dough holden mr spencer said how lovely to see you come in dear are you frozen to death i think she wa glad to see me she liked me at least i think she did boy did i get in that house fast how are you mr spencer i said how s mr spencer let me take your coat dear she said she didn t hear me ask her how mr spencer wa she wa sort of deaf she hung up my coat in the hall closet and i sort of brushed my hair back with my hand i wear a crew cut quite frequently and i never have to comb it much how ve you been mr spencer i said again only louder so she d hear me i ve been just fine holden she closed the closet door how have you been the way she asked me i knew right away old spencer d told her i d been kicked out fine i said how s mr spencer he over his grippe yet over it holden he s behaving like a perfect i don t know what he s in his room dear go right in they each had their own room and all they were both around seventy year old or even more than that they got a bang out of thing though in a haif assed way of course i know that sound mean to say but i don t mean it mean i just mean that i used to think about old spencer quite a lot and if you thought about him too much you wondered what the heck he wa still living for i mean he wa all stooped over and he had very terrible posture and in class whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him that s awful in my opinion but if you thought about him just enough and not too much you could figure it out that he wasn t doing too bad for himself for instance one sunday when some other guy and i were over there for hot chocolate he showed u this old beat up navajo blanket that he and mr spencer d bought off some indian in yellowstone park you could tell old spencer d got a big bang out of buying it that s what i mean you take somebody old a hell like old spencer and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket his door wa open but i sort of knocked on it anyway just to be polite and all i could see where he wa sitting he wa sitting in a big leather chair all wrapped up in that blanket i just told you about he looked over at me when i knocked who s that he yelled caulfield come in boy he wa always yelling outside class it got on your nerve sometimes the minute i went in i wa sort of sorry i d come he wa reading the atlantic monthly and there were pill and medicine all over the place and everything smelled like vicks nose drop it wa pretty depressing i m not too crazy about sick people anyway what made it even more depressing old spencer had on this very sad ratty old bathrobe that he wa probably born in or something i don t much like to see old guy in their pajama and bathrobe anyway their bumpy old chest are always showing and their leg old guy leg at beach and place always look so white and unhairy hello sir i said i got your note thanks a lot he d written me this note asking me to stop by and say good by before vacation started on account of i wasn t coming back you didn t have to do all that i d have come over to say good by anyway have a seat there boy old spencer said he meant the bed i sat down on it how s your grippe sir m boy if i felt any better i d have to send for the doctor old spencer said that knocked him out he started chuckling like a madman then he finally straightened himself out and said why aren t you down at the game i thought this wa the day of the big game it is i wa only i just got back from new york with the fencing team i said boy his bed wa like a rock he started getting serious a hell i knew he would so you re leaving u eh he said yes sir i guess i am he started going into this nodding routine you never saw anybody nod a much in your life a old spencer did you never knew if he wa nodding a lot because he wa thinking and all or just because he wa a nice old guy that didn t know his as from his elbow what did dr thurmer say to you boy i understand you had quite a little chat yes we did we really did i wa in his office for around two hour i guess what d he say to you oh well about life being a game and all and how you should play it according to the rule he wa pretty nice about it i mean he didn t hit the ceiling or anything he just kept talking about life being a game and all you know life is a game boy life is a game that one play according to the rule yes sir i know it is i know it game my as some game if you get on the side where all the hot shot are then it s a game all right i ll admit that but if you get on the other side where there aren t any hot shot then what s a game about it nothing no game ha dr thurmer written to your parent yet old spencer asked me he said he wa going to write them monday have you yourself communicated with them no sir i haven t communicated with them because i ll probably see them wednesday night when i get home and how do you think they ll take the news well they ll be pretty irritated about it i said they really will this is about the fourth school i ve gone to i shook my head i shake my head quite a lot boy i said i also say boy quite a lot partly because i have a lousy vocabulary and partly because i act quite young for my age sometimes i wa sixteen then and i m seventeen now and sometimes i act like i m about thirteen it s really ironical because i m six foot two and a half and i have gray hair i really do the one side of my head the right side is full of million of gray hair i ve had them ever since i wa a kid and yet i still act sometimes like i wa only about twelve everybody say that especially my father it s partly true too but it isn t all true people always think something s all true i don t give a damn except that i get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age sometimes i act a lot older than i am i really do but people never notice it people never notice anything old spencer started nodding again he also started picking his nose he made out like he wa only pinching it but he wa really getting the old thumb right in there i guess he thought it wa all right to do because it wa only me that wa in the room i didn t care except that it s pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose then he said i had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had their little chat with dr thurmer some week ago they re grand people yes they are they re very nice grand there s a word i really hate it s a phony i could puke every time i hear it then all of a sudden old spencer looked like he had something very good something sharp a a tack to say to me he sat up more in his chair and sort of moved around it wa a false alarm though all he did wa lift the atlantic monthly off his lap and try to chuck it on the bed next to me he missed it wa only about two inch away but he missed anyway i got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed all of a sudden then i wanted to get the hell out of the room i could feel a terrific lecture coming on i didn t mind the idea so much but i didn t feel like being lectured to and smell vicks nose drop and look at old spencer in his pajama and bathrobe all at the same time i really didn t it started all right what s the matter with you boy old spencer said he said it pretty tough too for him how many subject did you carry this term five sir five and how many are you failing in four i moved my as a little bit on the bed it wa the hardest bed i ever sat on i passed english all right i said because i had all that beowulf and lord randal my son stuff when i wa at the whooton school i mean i didn t have to do any work in english at all hardly except write composition once in a while he wasn t even listening he hardly ever listened to you when you said something i flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing i know that sir boy i know it you couldn t help it absolutely nothing he said over again that s something that drive me crazy when people say something twice that way after you admit it the first time then he said it three time but absolutely nothing i doubt very much if you opened your textbook even once the whole term did you tell the truth boy well i sort of glanced through it a couple of time i told him i didn t want to hurt his feeling he wa mad about history you glanced through it eh he said very sarcastic your ah exam paper is over there on top of my chiffonier on top of the pile bring it here please it wa a very dirty trick but i went over and brought it over to him i didn t have any alternative or anything then i sat down on his cement bed again boy you can t imagine how sorry i wa getting that i d stopped by to say good by to him he started handling my exam paper like it wa a turd or something we studied the egyptian from november th to december nd he said you chose to write about them for the optional essay question would you care to hear what you had to say no sir not very much i said he read it anyway though you can t stop a teacher when they want to do something they just do it the egyptian were an ancient race of caucasian residing in one of the northern section of africa the latter a we all know is the largest continent in the eastern hemisphere i had to sit there and listen to that crap it certainly wa a dirty trick the egyptian are extremely interesting to u today for various reason modern science would still like to know what the secret ingredient were that the egyptian used when they wrapped up dead people so that their face would not rot for innumerable century this interesting riddle is still quite a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century he stopped reading and put my paper down i wa beginning to sort of hate him your essay shall we say end there he said in this very sarcastic voice you wouldn t think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all however you dropped me a little note at the bottom of the page he said i know i did i said i said it very fast because i wanted to stop him before he started reading that out loud but you couldn t stop him he wa hot a a firecracker dear mr spencer he read out loud that is all i know about the egyptian i can t seem to get very interested in them although your lecture are very interesting it is all right with me if you flunk me though a i am flunking everything else except english anyway respectfully yours holden caulfield he put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like he d just beaten hell out of me in ping pong or something i don t think i ll ever forgive him for reading me that crap out loud i wouldn t ve read it out loud to him if he d written it i really wouldn t in the first place i d only written that damn note so that he wouldn t feel too bad about flunking me do you blame me for flunking you boy he said no sir i certainly don t i said i wished to hell he d stop calling me boy all the time he tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he wa through with it only he missed again naturally i had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the atlantic monthly it s boring to do that every two minute what would you have done in my place he said tell the truth boy well you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me so i shot the bull for a while i told him i wa a real moron and all that stuff i told him how i would ve done exactly the same thing if i d been in his place and how most people didn t appreciate how tough it is being a teacher that kind of stuff the old bull the funny thing is though i wa sort of thinking of something else while i shot the bull i live in new york and i wa thinking about the lagoon in central park down near central park south i wa wondering if it would be frozen over when i got home and if it wa where did the duck go i wa wondering where the duck went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over i wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them away to a zoo or something or if they just flew away i m lucky though i mean i could shoot the old bull to old spencer and think about those duck at the same time it s funny you don t have to think too hard when you talk to a teacher all of a sudden though he interrupted me while i wa shooting the bull he wa always interrupting you how do you feel about all this boy i d be very interested to know very interested you mean about my flunking out of pencey and all i said i sort of wished he d cover up his bumpy chest it wasn t such a beautiful view if i m not mistaken i believe you also had some difficulty at the whooton school and at elkton hill he didn t say it just sarcastic but sort of nasty too i didn t have too much difficulty at elkton hill i told him i didn t exactly flunk out or anything i just quit sort of why may i ask why oh well it s a long story sir i mean it s pretty complicated i didn t feel like going into the whole thing with him he wouldn t have understood it anyway it wasn t up his alley at all one of the biggest reason i left elkton hill wa because i wa surrounded by phony that s all they were coming in the goddam window for instance they had this headmaster mr haas that wa the phoniest bastard i ever met in my life ten time worse than old thurmer on sunday for instance old haas went around shaking hand with everybody s parent when they drove up to school he d be charming a hell and all except if some boy had little old funny looking parent you should ve seen the way he did with my roommate s parent i mean if a boy s mother wa sort of fat or corny looking or something and if somebody s father wa one of those guy that wear those suit with very big shoulder and corny black and white shoe then old han would just shake hand with them and give them a phony smile and then he d go talk for maybe a half an hour with somebody else s parent i can t stand that stuff it drive me crazy it make me so depressed i go crazy i hated that goddam elkton hill old spencer asked me something then but i didn t hear him i wa thinking about old haas what sir i said do you have any particular qualm about leaving pencey oh i have a few qualm all right sure but not too many not yet anyway i guess it hasn t really hit me yet it take thing a while to hit me all i m doing right now is thinking about going home wednesday i m a moron do you feel absolutely no concern for your future boy oh i feel some concern for my future all right sure sure i do i thought about it for a minute but not too much i guess not too much i guess you will old spencer said you will boy you will when it s too late i didn t like hearing him say that it made me sound dead or something it wa very depressing i guess i will i said i d like to put some sense in that head of yours boy i m trying to help you i m trying to help you if i can he really wa too you could see that but it wa just that we were too much on opposite side ot the pole that s all i know you are sir i said thanks a lot no kidding i appreciate it i really do i got up from the bed then boy i couldn t ve sat there another ten minute to save my life the thing is though i have to get going now i have quite a bit of equipment at the gym i have to get to take home with me i really do he looked up at me and started nodding again with this very serious look on his face i felt sorry a hell for him all of a sudden but i just couldn t hang around there any longer the way we were on opposite side of the pole and the way he kept missing the bed whenever he chucked something at it and his sad old bathrobe with his chest showing and that grippy smell of vicks nose drop all over the place look sir don t worry about me i said i mean it i ll be all right i m just going through a phase right now everybody go through phase and all don t they i don t know boy i don t know i hate it when somebody answer that way sure sure they do i said i mean it sir please don t worry about me i sort of put my hand on his shoulder okay i said wouldn t you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go mr spencer would be i would i really would but the thing is i have to get going i have to go right to the gym thanks though thanks a lot sir then we shook hand and all that crap it made me feel sad a hell though i ll drop you a line sir take care of your grippe now good by boy after i shut the door and started back to the living room he yelled something at me but i couldn t exactly hear him i m pretty sure he yelled good luck at me i hope to hell not i d never yell good luck at anybody it sound terrible when you think about it i m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life it s awful if i m on my way to the store to buy a magazine even and somebody asks me where i m going i m liable to say i m going to the opera it s terrible so when i told old spencer i had to go to the gym and get my equipment and stuff that wa a sheer lie i don t even keep my goddam equipment in the gym where i lived at pencey i lived in the ossenburger memorial wing of the new dorm it wa only for junior and senior i wa a junior my roommate wa a senior it wa named after this guy ossenburger that went to pencey he made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of pencey what he did he started these undertaking parlor all over the country that you could get member of your family buried for about five buck apiece you should see old ossenburger he probably just shove them in a sack and dump them in the river anyway he gave pencey a pile of dough and they named our wing alter him the first football game of the year he came up to school in this big goddam cadillac and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and give him a locomotive that s a cheer then the next morning in chapel be made a speech that lasted about ten hour he started off with about fifty corny joke just to show u what a regular guy he wa very big deal then he started telling u how he wa never ashamed when he wa in some kind of trouble or something to get right down his knee and pray to god he told u we should always pray to god talk to him and all wherever we were he told u we ought to think of jesus a our buddy and all he said he talked to jesus all the time even when he wa driving his car that killed me i just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking jesus to send him a few more stiff the only good part of his speech wa right in the middle of it he wa telling u all about what a swell guy he wa what a hot shot and all then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me edgar marsalla laid this terrific fart it wa a very crude thing to do in chapel and all but it wa also quite amusing old marsalla he damn near blew the roof off hardly anybody laughed out loud and old ossenburger made out like he didn t even hear it but old thurmer the headmaster wa sitting right next to him on the rostrum and all and you could tell he heard it boy wa he sore he didn t say anything then but the next night he made u have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and made a speech he said that the boy that had created the disturbance in chapel wasn t fit to go to pencey we tried to get old marsalla to rip off another one right while old thurmer wa making his speech but be wasn t in the right mood anyway that s where i lived at pencey old ossenburger memorial wing in the new dorm it wa pretty nice to get back to my room after i left old spencer because everybody wa down at the game and the heat wa on in our room for a change it felt sort of cosy i took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar and then i put on this hat that i d bought in new york that morning it wa this red hunting hat with one of those very very long peak i saw it in the window of this sport store when we got out of the subway just after i noticed i d lost all the goddam foil it only cost me a buck the way i wore it i swung the old peak way around to the back very corny i ll admit but i liked it that way i looked good in it that way then i got this book i wa reading and sat down in my chair there were two chair in every room i had one and my roommate ward stradlater had one the arm were in sad shape because everybody wa always sitting on them but they were pretty comfortable chair the book i wa reading wa this book i took out of the library by mistake they gave me the wrong book and i didn t notice it till i got back to my room they gave me out of africa by isak dinesen i thought it wa going to stink but it didn t it wa a very good book i m quite illiterate but i read a lot my favorite author is my brother d b and my next favorite is ring lardner my brother gave me a book by ring lardner for my birthday just before i went to pencey it had these very funny crazy play in it and then it had this one story about a traffic cop that fall in love with this very cute girl that s always speeding only he s married the cop so be can t marry her or anything then this girl get killed because she s always speeding that story just about killed me what i like best is a book that s at least funny once in a while i read a lot of classical book like the return of the native and all and i like them and i read a lot of war book and mystery and all but they don t knock me out too much what really knock me out is a book that when you re all done reading it you wish the author that wrote it wa a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it that doesn t happen much though i wouldn t mind calling this isak dinesen up and ring lardner except that d b told me he s dead you take that book of human bondage by somerset maugham though i read it last summer it s a pretty good book and all but i wouldn t want to call somerset maugham up i don t know he just isn t the kind of guy i d want to call up that s all i d rather call old thomas hardy up i like that eustacia vye anyway i put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book out of africa i d read it already but i wanted to read certain part over again i d only read about three page though when i heard somebody coming through the shower curtain even without looking up i knew right away who it wa it wa robert ackley this guy that roomed right next to me there wa a shower right between every two room in our wing and about eighty five time a day old ackley barged in on me he wa probably the only guy in the whole dorm besides me that wasn t down at the game he hardly ever went anywhere he wa a very peculiar guy he wa a senior and he d been at pencey the whole four year and all but nobody ever called him anything except ackley not even herb gale his own roommate ever called him bob or even ack if he ever get married his own wife ll probably call him ackley he wa one of these very very tall round shouldered guy he wa about six four with lousy teeth the whole time he roomed next to me i never even once saw him brush his teeth they always looked mossy and awful and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room with his mouth full of mashed potato and pea or something besides that he had a lot of pimple not just on his forehead or his chin like most guy but all over his whole face and not only that he had a terrible personality he wa also sort of a nasty guy i wasn t too crazy about him to tell you the truth i could feel him standing on the shower ledge right behind my chair taking a look to see if stradlater wa around he hated stradlater s gut and he never came in the room if stradlater wa around he hated everybody s gut damn near he came down off the shower ledge and came in the room hi he said he always said it like he wa terrifically bored or terrifically tired he didn t want you to think he wa visiting you or anything he wanted you to think he d come in by mistake for god s sake hi i said but i didn t look up from my book with a guy like ackley if you looked up from your book you were a goner you were a goner anyway but not a quick if you didn t look up right away he started walking around the room very slow and all the way he always did picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier he always picked up your personal stuff and looked at it boy could he get on your nerve sometimes how wa the fencing he said he just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself he didn t give a damn about the fencing we win or what he said nobody won i said without looking up though what he said he always made you say everything twice nobody won i said i sneaked a look to see what he wa fiddling around with on my chiffonier he wa looking at this picture of this girl i used to go around with in new york sally hayes he must ve picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at least five thousand time since i got it he always put it back in the wrong place too when he wa finished he did it on purpose you could tell nobody won he said how come i left the goddam foil and stuff on the subway i still didn t look up at him on the subway for chrissake ya lost them ya mean we got on the wrong subway i had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map on the wall he came over and stood right in my light hey i said i ve read this same sentence about twenty time since you came in anybody else except ackley would ve taken the goddam hint not him though think they ll make ya pay for em he said i don t know and i don t give a damn how bout sitting down or something ackley kid you re right in my goddam light he didn t like it when you called him ackley kid he wa always telling me i wa a goddam kid because i wa sixteen and he wa eighteen it drove him mad when i called him ackley kid he kept standing there he wa exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn t get out of your light when you asked him to he d do it finally but it took him a lot longer if you asked him to what the hellya reading he said goddam book he shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it any good he said this sentence i m reading is terrific i can be quite sarcastic when i m in the mood he didn t get it though he started walking around the room again picking up all my personal stuff and stradlater s finally i put my book down on the floor you couldn t read anything with a guy like ackley around it wa impossible i slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old ackley making himself at home i wa feeling sort of tired from the trip to new york and all and i started yawning then i started horsing around a little bit sometimes i horse around quite a lot just to keep from getting bored what i did wa i pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around to the front then pulled it way down over my eye that way i couldn t see a goddam thing i think i m going blind i said in this very hoarse voice mother darling everything s getting so dark in here you re nut i swear to god ackley said mother darling give me your hand why won t you give me your hand for chrissake grow up i started groping around in front of me like a blind guy but without getting up or anything i kept saying mother darling why won t you give me your hand i wa only horsing around naturally that stuff give me a bang sometimes besides i know it annoyed hell out of old ackley he always brought out the old sadist in me i wa pretty sadistic with him quite often finally i quit though i pulled the peak around to the back again and relaxed who belongsa this ackley said he wa holding my roommate s knee supporter up to show me that guy ackley d pick up anything he d even pick up your jock strap or something i told him it wa stradlater s so he chucked it on stradlater s bed he got it off stradlater s chiffonier so he chucked it on the bed he came over and sat down on the arm of stradlater s chair he never sat down in a chair just always on the arm where the hellja get that hat he said new york how much a buck you got robbed he started cleaning his goddam fingernail with the end of a match he wa always cleaning his fingernail it wa funny in a way his teeth were always mossy looking and his ear were always dirty a hell but he wa always cleaning his fingernail i guess he thought that made him a very neat guy he took another look at my hat while he wa cleaning them up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in for chrissake he said that s a deer shooting hat like hell it is i took it off and looked at it i sort of closed one eye like i wa taking aim at it this is a people shooting hat i said i shoot people in this hat your folk know you got kicked out yet nope where the hell s stradlater at anyway down at the game he s got a date i yawned i wa yawning all over the place for one thing the room wa too damn hot it made you sleepy at pencey you either froze to death or died of the heat the great stradlater ackley said hey lend me your scissors a second willya ya got em handy no i packed them already they re way in the top of the closet get em a second willya ackley said i got this hangnail i want to cut off he didn t care if you d packed something or not and had it way in the top of the closet i got them for him though i nearly got killed doing it too the second i opened the closet door stradlater s tennis racket in it wooden press and all fell right on my head it made a big clunk and it hurt like hell it damn near killed old ackley though he started laughing in this very high falsetto voice he kept laughing the whole time i wa taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him something like that a guy getting hit on the head with a rock or something tickled the pant off ackley you have a damn good sense of humor ackley kid i told him you know that i handed him the scissors lem me be your manager i ll get you on the goddam radio i sat down in my chair again and he started cutting his big horny looking nail how bout using the table or something i said cut em over the table willya i don t feel like walking on your crumby nail in my bare foot tonight he kept right on cutting them over the floor though what lousy manner i mean it who s stradlater s date he said he wa always keeping tab on who stradlater wa dating even though he hated stradlater s gut i don t know why no reason boy i can t stand that sonuvabitch he s one sonuvabitch i really can t stand he s crazy about you he told me he think you re a goddam prince i said i call people a prince quite often when i m horsing around it keep me from getting bored or something he s got this superior attitude all the time ackley said i just can t stand the sonuvabitch you d think he do you mind cutting your nail over the table hey i said i ve asked you about fifty he s got this goddam superior attitude all the time ackley said i don t even think the sonuvabitch is intelligent he think he is he think he s about the most ackley for chrissake willya please cut your crumby nail over the table i ve asked you fifty time he started cutting his nail over the table for a change the only way he ever did anything wa if you yelled at him i watched him for a while then i said the reason you re sore at stradlater is because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while he didn t mean to insult you for cryin out loud he didn t say it right or anything but he didn t mean anything insulting all he meant wa you d look better and feel better if you sort of brushed your teeth once in a while i brush my teeth don t gim me that no you don t i ve seen you and you don t i said i didn t say it nasty though i felt sort of sorry for him in a way i mean it isn t too nice naturally if somebody tell you you don t brush your teeth stradlater s all right he s not too bad i said you don t know him thats the trouble i still say he s a sonuvabitch he s a conceited sonuvabitch he s conceited but he s very generous in some thing he really is i said look suppose for instance stradlater wa wearing a tie or something that you liked say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot i m just giving you an example now you know what he d do he d probably take it off and give it ta you he really would or you know what he d do he d leave it on your bed or something but he d give you the goddam tie most guy would probably just hell ackley said if i had his dough i would too no you wouldn t i shook my head no you wouldn t ackley kid if you had his dough you d be one of the biggest stop calling me ackley kid god damn it i m old enough to be your lousy father no you re not boy he could really be aggravating sometimes he never missed a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he wa eighteen in the first place i wouldn t let you in my goddam family i said well just cut out calling me all of a sudden the door opened and old stradlater barged in in a big hurry he wa always in a big hurry everything wa a very big deal he came over to me and gave me these two playful a hell slap on both cheek which is something that can be very annoying listen he said you going out anywheres special tonight i don t know i might what the hell s it doing out snowing he had snow all over his coat yeah listen if you re not going out anyplace special how bout lending me your hound s tooth jacket who won the game i said it s only the half we re leaving stradlater said no kidding you gon na use your hound s tooth tonight or not i spilled some crap all over my gray flannel no but i don t want you stretching it with your goddam shoulder and all i said we were practically the same heighth but he weighed about twice a much a i did he had these very broad shoulder i won t stretch it he went over to the closet in a big hurry how sa boy ackley he said to ackley he wa at least a pretty friendly guy stradlater it wa partly a phony kind of friendly but at least he always said hello to ackley and all ackley just sort of grunted when he said how sa boy he wouldn t answer him but he didn t have gut enough not to at least grunt then he said to me i think i ll get going see ya later okay i said he never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own room old stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all i think maybe i ll take a fast shave he said he had a pretty heavy beard he really did where s your date i asked him she s waiting in the annex he went out of the room with his toilet kit and towel under his arm no shirt on or anything he always walked around in his bare torso because he thought he had a damn good build he did too i have to admit it i didn t have anything special to do so i went down to the can and chewed the rag with him while he wa shaving we were the only one in the can because everybody wa still down at the game it wa hot a hell and the window were all steamy there were about ten washbowl all right against the wall stradlater had the middle one i sat down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off this nervous habit i have stradlater kept whistling song of india while he shaved he had one of those very piercing whistle that are practically never in tune and he always picked out some song that s hard to whistle even if you re a good whistler like song of india or slaughter on tenth avenue he could really mess a song up you remember i said before that ackley wa a slob in his personal habit well so wa stradlater but in a different way stradlater wa more of a secret slob he always looked all right stradlater but for instance you should ve seen the razor he shaved himself with it wa always rusty a hell and full of lather and hair and crap he never cleaned it or anything he always looked good when he wa finished fixing himself up but he wa a secret slob anyway if you knew him the way i did the reason he fixed himself up to look good wa because he wa madly in love with himself he thought he wa the handsomest guy in the western hemisphere he wa pretty handsome too i ll admit it but he wa mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parent saw his picture in your year book they d right away say who s this boy i mean he wa mostly a year book kind of handsome guy i knew a lot of guy at pencey i thought were a lot handsomer than stradlater but they wouldn t look handsome if you saw their picture in the year book they d look like they had big nose or their ear stuck out i ve had that experience frequently anyway i wa sitting on the washbowl next to where stradlater wa shaving sort of turning the water on and off i still had my red hunting hat on with the peak around to the back and all i really got a bang out of that hat hey stradlater said wan na do me a big favor what i said not too enthusiastic he wa always asking you to do him a big favor you take a very handsome guy or a guy that think he s a real hot shot and they re always asking you to do them a big favor just because they re crazy about themseif they think you re crazy about them too and that you re just dying to do them a favor it s sort of funny in a way you goin out tonight he said i might i might not i don t know why i got about a hundred page to read for history for monday he said how bout writing a composition for me for english i ll be up the creek if i don t get the goddam thing in by monday the reason i ask how bout it it wa very ironical it really wa i m the one that s flunking out of the goddam place and you re asking me to write you a goddam composition i said yeah i know the thing is though i ll be up the creek if i don t get it in be a buddy be a buddyroo okay i didn t answer him right away suspense is good for some bastard like stradlater what on i said anything anything descriptive a room or a house or something you once lived in or something you know just a long a it s descriptive a hell he gave out a big yawn while he said that which is something that give me a royal pain in the as i mean if somebody yawn right while they re asking you to do them a goddam favor just don t do it too good is all he said that sonuvabitch hartzell think you re a hot shot in english and he know you re my roommate so i mean don t stick all the comma and stuff in the right place that s something else that give me a royal pain i mean if you re good at writing composition and somebody start talking about comma stradlater wa always doing that he wanted you to think that the only reason he wa lousy at writing composition wa because he stuck all the comma in the wrong place he wa a little bit like ackley that way i once sat next to ackley at this basketball game we had a terrific guy on the team howie coyle that could sink them from the middle of the floor without even touching the backboard or anything ackley kept saying the whole goddam game that coyle had a perfect build for basketball god how i hate that stuff i got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while so i backed up a few foot and started doing this tap dance just for the hell of it i wa just amusing myself i can t really tap dance or anything but it wa a stone floor in the can and it wa good for tap dancing i started imitating one of those guy in the movie in one of those musical i hate the movie like poison but i get a bang imitating them old stradlater watched me in the mirror while he wa shaving all i need s an audience i m an exhibitionist i m the goddarn governor s son i said i wa knocking myself out tap dancing all over the place he doesn t want me to be a tap dancer he want me to go to oxford but it s in my goddam blood tap dancing old stradlater laughed he didn t have too bad a sense of humor it s the opening night of the ziegfeld folly i wa getting out of breath i have hardly any wind at all the leading man can t go on he s drunk a a bastard so who do they get to take his place me that s who the little ole goddam governor s son where dja get that hat stradlater said he meant my hunting hat he d never seen it before i wa out of breath anyway so i quit horsing around i took off my hat and looked at it for about the ninetieth time i got it in new york this morning for a buck ya like it stradlater nodded sharp he said he wa only flattering me though because right away he said listen are ya gon na write that composition for me i have to know if i get the time i will if i don t i won t i said i went over and sat down at the washbowl next to him again who s your date i asked him fitzgerald hell no i told ya i m through with that pig yeah give her to me boy no kidding she s my type take her she s too old for you all of a sudden for no good reason really except that i wa sort of in the mood for horsing around i felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old stradlater in a half nelson that s a wrestling hold in case you don t know where you get the other guy around the neck and choke him to death if you feel like it so i did it i landed on him like a goddam panther cut it out holden for chrissake stradlater said he didn t feel like horsing around he wa shaving and all wuddaya wan na make me do cut my goddam head off i didn t let go though i had a pretty good half nelson on him liberate yourself from my viselike grip i said je sus christ he put down his razor and all of a sudden jerked his arm up and sort of broke my hold on him he wa a very strong guy i m a very weak guy now cut out the crap he said he started shaving himself all over again he always shaved himself twice to look gorgeous with his crumby old razor who is your date if it isn t fitzgerald i asked him i sat down on the washbowl next to him again that phyllis smith babe no it wa supposed to he but the arrangement got all screwed up i got bud thaw s girl s roommate now hey i almost forgot she know you who doe i said my date yeah i said what s her name i wa pretty interested i m thinking uh jean gallagher boy i nearly dropped dead when he said that jane gallagher i said i even got up from the washbowl when he said that i damn near dropped dead you re damn right i know her she practically lived right next door to me the summer before last she had this big damn doberman pinscher that s how i met her her dog used to keep coming over in our you re right in my light holden for chrissake stradlater said ya have to stand right there boy wa i excited though i really wa where is she

them all lined up in the back row then she d never use them she just liked the way they looked when they were all in the back row stradlater didn t say anything that kind of stuff doesn t interest most people her mother belonged to the same club we did i said i used to caddy once in a while just to make some dough i caddy d for her mother a couple of time she went around in about a hundred and seventy for nine hole stradlater wasn t hardly listening he wa combing his gorgeous lock i oughta go down and at least say hello to her i said why don tcha i will in a minute he started parting his hair all over again it took him about an hour to comb his hair her mother and father were divorced her mother wa married again to some booze hound i said skinny guy with hairy leg i remember him he wore short all the time jane said he wa supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing but all i ever saw him do wa booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery program on the radio and run around the goddam house naked with jane around and all yeah stradlater said that really interested him about the booze hound running around the house naked with jane around stradlater wa a very sexy bastard she had a lousy childhood i m not kidding that didn t interest stradlater though only very sexy stuff interested him jane gallagher jesus i couldn t get her off my mind i really couldn t i oughta go down and say hello to her at least why the hell don tcha instead of keep saying it stradlater said i walked over to the window but you couldn t see out of it it wa so steamy from all the heat in the can i m not in the mood right now i said i wasn t either you have to be in the mood for those thing i thought she went to shipley i could ve sworn she went to shipley i walked around the can for a little while i didn t have anything else to do did she enjoy the game i said yeah i guess so i don t know did she tell you we used to play checker all the time or anything i don t know for chrissake i only just met her stradlater said he wa finished combing his goddam gorgeous hair he wa putting away all his crumby toilet article listen give her my regard willya okay stradlater said but i knew he probably wouldn t you take a guy like stradlater they never give your regard to people he went back to the room but i stuck around in the can for a while thinking about old jane then i went back to the room too stradlater wa putting on his tie in front of the mirror when i got there he spent around half his goddam life in front of the mirror i sat down in my chair and sort of watched him for a while hey i said don t tell her i got kicked out willya okay that wa one good thing about stradlater you didn t have to explain every goddam little thing with him the way you had to do with ackley mostly i guess because he wasn t too interested that s really why ackley it wa different ackley wa a very nosy bastard he put on my hound s tooth jacket jesus now try not to stretch it all over the place i said i d only worn it about twice i won t where the hell s my cigarette on the desk he never knew where he left anything under your muffler he put them in his coat pocket my coat pocket i pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden for a change i wa getting sort of nervous all of a sudden i m quite a nervous guy listen where ya going on your date with her i asked him ya know yet i don t know new york if we have time she only signed out for nine thirty for chrissake i didn t like the way he said it so i said the reason she did that she probably just didn t know what a handsome charming bastard you are if she d known she probably would ve signed out for nine thirty in the morning goddam right stradlater said you couldn t rile him too easily he wa too conceited no kidding now do that composition for me he said he had his coat on and he wa all ready to go don t knock yourself out or anything but just make it descriptive a hell okay i didn t answer him i didn t feel like it all i said wa ask her if she still keep all her king in the back row okay stradlater said but i knew he wouldn t take it easy now he banged the hell out of the room i sat there for about a half hour after he left i mean i just sat in my chair not doing anything i kept thinking about jane and about stradlater having a date with her and all it made me so nervous i nearly went crazy i already told you what a sexy bastard stradlater wa all of a sudden ackley barged back in again through the damn shower curtain a usual for once in my stupid life i wa really glad to see him he took my mind off the other stuff he stuck around till around dinnertime talking about all the guy at pencey that he hated their gut and squeezing this big pimple on his chin he didn t even use his handkerchief i don t even think the bastard had a handkerchief if you want to know the truth i never saw him use one anyway we always had the same meal on saturday night at pencey it wa supposed to be a big deal because they gave you steak i ll bet a thousand buck the reason they did that wa because a lot of guy parent came up to school on sunday and old thurmer probably figured everybody s mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner last night and he d say steak what a racket you should ve seen the steak they were these little hard dry job that you could hardly even cut you always got these very lumpy mashed potato on steak night and for dessert you got brown betty which nobody ate except maybe the little kid in the lower school that didn t know any better and guy like ackley that ate everything it wa nice though when we got out of the dining room there were about three inch of snow on the ground and it wa still coming down like a madman it looked pretty a hell and we all started throwing snowball and horsing around all over the place it wa very childish but everybody wa really enjoying themselves i didn t have a date or anything so i and this friend of mine mal brossard that wa on the wrestling team decided we d take a bus into agerstown and have a hamburger and maybe see a lousy movie neither of u felt like sitting around on our as all night i asked mal if he minded if ackley came along with u the reason i asked wa because ackley never did anything on saturday night except stay in his room and squeeze his pimple or something mal said he didn t mind but that he wasn t too crazy about the idea he didn t like ackley much anyway we both went to our room to get ready and all and while i wa putting on my galosh and crap i yelled over and asked old ackley if he wanted to go to the movie he could hear me all right through the shower curtain but he didn t answer me right away he wa the kind of a guy that hate to answer you right away finally he came over through the goddam curtain and stood on the shower ledge and asked who wa going besides me he always had to know who wa going i swear if that guy wa shipwrecked somewhere and you rescued him in a goddam boat he d want to know who the guy wa that wa rowing it before he d even get in i told him mal brossard wa going he said that bastard all right wait a second you d think he wa doing you a big favor it took him about five hour to get ready while he wa doing it i went over to my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hand the snow wa very good for packing i didn t throw it at anything though i started to throw it at a car that wa parked across the street but i changed my mind the car looked so nice and white then i started to throw it at a hydrant but that looked too nice and white too finally i didn t throw it at anything all i did wa close the window and walk around the room with the snowball packing it harder a little while later i still had it with me when i and brossnad and ackley got on the bus the bus driver opened the door and made me throw it out i told him i wasn t going to chuck it at anybody but he wouldn t believe me people never believe you brossard and ackley both had seen the picture that wa playing so all we did we just had a couple of hamburger and played the pinball machine for a little while then took the bus back to pencey i didn t care about not seeing the movie anyway it wa supposed to be a comedy with cary grant in it and all that crap besides i d been to the movie with brossard and ackley before they both laughed like hyena at stuff that wasn t even funny i didn t even enjoy sitting next to them in the movie it wa only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm old brossard wa a bridge fiend and he started looking around the dorm for a game old ackley parked himself in my room just for a change only instead of sitting on the arm of stradlater s chair he laid down on my bed with his face right on my pillow and all he started talking in this very monotonous voice and picking at all his pimple i dropped about a thousand hint but i couldn t get rid of him all he did wa keep talking in this very monotonous voice about some babe he wa supposed to have had sexual intercourse with the summer before he d already told me about it about a hundred time every time he told it it wa different one minute he d be giving it to her in his cousin s buick the next minute he d be giving it to her under some boardwalk it wa all a lot of crap naturally he wa a virgin if ever i saw one i doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel anyway finally i had to come right out and tell him that i had to write a composition for stradlater and that he had to clear the hell out so i could concentrate he finally did but he took his time about it a usual after he left i put on my pajama and bathrobe and my old hunting hat and started writing the composition the thing wa i couldn t think of a room or a house or anything to describe the way stradlater said he had to have i m not too crazy about describing room and house anyway so what i did i wrote about my brother allie s baseball mitt it wa a very descriptive subject it really wa my brother allie had this left handed fielder s mitt he wa left handed the thing that wa descriptive about it though wa that he had poem written all over the finger and the pocket and everywhere in green ink he wrote them on it so that he d have something to read when he wa in the field and nobody wa up at bat he s dead now he got leukemia and died when we were up in maine on july you d have liked him he wa two year younger than i wa but he wa about fifty time a intelligent he wa terrifically intelligent his teacher were always writing letter to my mother telling her what a pleasure it wa having a boy like allie in their class and they weren t just shooting the crap they really meant it but it wasn t just that he wa the most intelligent member in the family he wa also the nicest in lot of way he never got mad at anybody people with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily but allie never did and he had very red hair i ll tell you what kind of red hair he had i started playing golf when i wa only ten year old i remember once the summer i wa around twelve teeing off and all and having a hunch that if i turned around all of a sudden i d see allie so i did and sure enough he wa sitting on his bike outside the fence there wa this fence that went all around the course and he wa sitting there about a hundred and fifty yard behind me watching me tee off that s the kind of red hair he had god he wa a nice kid though he used to laugh so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair i wa only thirteen and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all because i broke all the window in the garage i don t blame them i really don t i slept in the garage the night he died and i broke all the goddam window with my fist just for the hell of it i even tried to break all the window on the station wagon we had that summer but my hand wa already broken and everything by that time and i couldn t do it it wa a very stupid thing to do i ll admit but i hardly didn t even know i wa doing it and you didn t know allie my hand still hurt me once in a while when it rain and all and i can t make a real fist any more not a tight one i mean but outside of that i don t care much i mean i m not going to be a goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway anyway that s what i wrote stradlater s composition about old allie s baseball mitt i happened to have it with me in my suitcase so i got it out and copied down the poem that were written on it all i had to do wa change allie s name so that nobody would know it wa my brother and not stradlater s i wasn t too crazy about doing it but i couldn t think of anything else descriptive besides i sort of liked writing about it it took me about an hour because i had to use stradlater s lousy typewriter and it kept jamming on me the reason i didn t use my own wa because i d lent it to a guy down the hall it wa around ten thirty i guess when i finished it i wasn t tired though so i looked out the window for a while it wasn t snowing out any more but every once in a while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started you could also hear old ackley snoring right through the goddam shower curtain you could hear him he had sinus trouble and he couldn t breathe too hot when he wa asleep that guy had just about everything sinus trouble pimple lousy teeth halitosis crumby fingernail you had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch some thing are hard to remember i m thinking now of when stradlater got back from his date with jane i mean i can t remember exactly what i wa doing when i heard his goddam stupid footstep coming down the corridor i probably wa still looking out the window but i swear i can t remember i wa so damn worried that s why when i really worry about something i don t just fool around i even have to go to the bathroom when i worry about something only i don t go i m too worried to go i don t want to interrupt my worrying to go if you knew stradlater you d have been worried too i d double dated with that bastard a couple of time and i know what i m talking about he wa unscrupulous he really wa anyway the corridor wa all linoleum and all and you could hear his goddam footstep coming right towards the room i don t even remember where i wa sitting when he came in at the window or in my chair or his i swear i can t remember he came in griping about how cold it wa out then he said where the hell is everybody it s like a goddam morgue around here i didn t even bother to answer him if he wa so goddam stupid not to realize it wa saturday night and everybody wa out or asleep or home for the week end i wasn t going to break my neck telling him he started getting undressed he didn t say one goddam word about jane not one neither did i i just watched him all he did wa thank me for letting him wear my hound s tooth he hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet then when he wa taking off his tie he asked me if i d written his goddam composition for him i told him it wa over on his goddam bed he walked over and read it while he wa unbuttoning his shirt he stood there reading it and sort of stroking his bare chest and stomach with this very stupid expression on his face he wa always stroking his stomach or his chest he wa mad about himself all of a sudden he said for chrissake holden this is about a goddam baseball glove so what i said cold a hell wuddaya mean so what i told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house or something you said it had to be descriptive what the hell s the difference if it s about a baseball glove god damn it he wa sore a hell he wa really furious you always do everything backasswards he looked at me no wonder you re flunking the hell out of here he said you don t do one damn thing the way you re supposed to i mean it not one damn thing all right give it back to me then i said i went over and pulled it right out of his goddam hand then i tore it up what the hellja do that for he said i didn t even answer him i just threw the piece in the wastebasket then i lay down on my bed and we both didn t say anything for a long time he got all undressed down to his short and i lay on my bed and lit a cigarette you weren t allowed to smoke in the dorm but you could do it late at night when everybody wa asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke besides i did it to annoy stradlater it drove him crazy when you broke any rule he never smoked in the dorm it wa only me he still didn t say one single solitary word about jane so finally i said you re back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for nine thirty did you make her be late signing in he wa sitting on the edge of his bed cutting his goddam toenail when i asked him that coupla minute he said who the hell sign out for nine thirty on a saturday night god how i hated him did you go to new york i said ya crazy how the hell could we go to new york if she only signed out for nine thirty that s tough he looked up at me listen he said if you re gon na smoke in the room how bout going down to the can and do it you may be getting the hell out of here but i have to stick around long enough to graduate i ignored him i really did i went right on smoking like a madman all i did wa sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenail what a school you were always watching somebody cut their damn toenail or squeeze their pimple or something did you give her my regard i asked him yeah the hell he did the bastard what d she say i said did you ask her if she still keep all her king in the back row no i didn t ask her what the hell ya think we did all night play checker for chrissake i didn t even answer him god how i hated him if you didn t go to new york where d ya go with her i asked him after a little while i could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place boy wa i getting nervous i just had a feeling something had gone funny he wa finished cutting his damn toenail so he got up from the bed in just his damn short and all and started getting very damn playful he came over to my bed and started leaning over me and taking these playful a hell sock at my shoulder cut it out i said where d you go with her if you didn t go to new york nowhere we just sat in the goddam car he gave me another one of those playtul stupid little sock on the shoulder cut it out i said whose car ed banky s ed banky wa the basketball coach at pencey old stradlater wa one of his pet because he wa the center on the team and ed banky always let him borrow his car when he wanted it it wasn t allowed for student to borrow faculty guy car but all the athletic bastard stuck together in every school i ve gone to all the athletic bastard stick together stradlater kept taking these shadow punch down at my shoulder he had his toothbrush in his hand and he put it in his mouth what d you do i said give her the time in ed banky s goddam car my voice wa shaking something awful what a thing to say want me to wash your mouth out with soap did you that s a professional secret buddy this next part i don t remember so hot all i know is i got up from the bed like i wa going down to the can or something and then i tried to sock him with all my might right smack in the toothbrush so it would split his goddam throat open only i missed i didn t connect all i did wa sort of get him on the side of the head or something it probably hurt him a little bit but not a much a i wanted it probably would ve hurt him a lot but i did it with my right hand and i can t make a good fist with that hand on account of that injury i told you about anyway the next thing i knew i wa on the goddam floor and he wa sitting on my chest with his face all red that is he had his goddam knee on my chest and he weighed about a ton he had hold of my wrist too so i couldn t take another sock at him i d ve killed him what the hell s the matter with you he kept saying and his stupid race kept getting redder and redder get your lousy knee off my chest i told him i wa almost bawling i really wa go on get off a me ya crumby bastard he wouldn t do it though he kept holding onto my wrist and i kept calling him a sonuvabitch and all for around ten hour i can hardly even remember what all i said to him i told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like i told him he didn t even care if a girl kept all her king in the back row or not and the reason he didn t care wa because he wa a goddam stupid moron he hated it when you called a moron all moron hate it when you call them a moron shut up now holden he said with his big stupid red face just shut up now you don t even know if her first name is jane or jean ya goddam moron now shut up holden god damn it i m warning ya he said i really had him going if you don t shut up i m gon na slam ya one get your dirty stinking moron knee off my chest if

if you don t keep your yap shut i m gon na why should i i said i wa practically yelling that s just the trouble with all you moron you never want to discus anything that s the way you can always tell a moron they never want to discus anything intellig then he really let one go at me and the next thing i knew i wa on the goddam floor again i don t remember if he knocked me out or not but i don t think so it s pretty hard to knock a guy out except in the goddam movie but my nose wa bleeding all over the place when i looked up old stradlater wa standing practically right on top of me he had his goddam toilet kit under his arm why the hell don tcha shut up when i tellya to he said he sounded pretty nervous he probably wa scared he d fractured my skull or something when i hit the floor it s too bad i didn t you asked for it god damn it he said boy did he look worried i didn t even bother to get up i just lay there in the floor for a while and kept calling him a moron sonuvabitch i wa so mad i wa practically bawling listen go wash your face stradlater said ya hear me i told him to go wash his own moron face which wa a pretty childish thing to say but i wa mad a hell i told him to stop off on the way to the can and give mr schmidt the time mr schmidt wa the janitor s wife she wa around sixty five i kept sitting there on the floor till i heard old stradlater close the door and go down the corridor to the can then i got up i couldn t find my goddam hunting hat anywhere finally i found it it wa under the bed i put it on and turned the old peak around to the back the way i liked it and then i went over and took a look at my stupid face in the mirror you never saw such gore in your life i had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajama and bath robe it partly scared me and it partly fascinated me all that blood and all sort of made me look tough i d only been in about two fight in my life and i lost both of them i m not too tough i m a pacifist if you want to know the truth i had a feeling old ackley d probably heard all the racket and wa awake so i went through the shower curtain into his room just to see what the hell he wa doing i hardly ever went over to his room it always had a funny stink in it because he wa so crumby in his personal habit a tiny bit of light came through the shower curtain and all from our room and i could see him lying in bed i knew damn well he wa wide awake ackley i said y awake yeah it wa pretty dark and i stepped on somebody s shoe on the floor and danm near fell on my head ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm he had a lot of white stuff on his face for his pimple he looked sort of spooky in the dark what the hellya doing anyway i said wuddaya mean what the hell am i doing i wa tryna sleep before you guy started making all that noise what the hell wa the fight about anyhow where s the light i couldn t find the light i wa sliding my hand all over the wall wuddaya want the light for right next to your hand i finally found the switch and turned it on old ackley put his hand up so the light wouldn t hurt his eye jesus he said what the hell happened to you he meant all the blood and all i had a little goddam tiff with stradlater i said then i sat down on the floor they never had any chair in their room i don t know what the hell they did with their chair listen i said do you feel like playing a little canasta he wa a canasta fiend you re still bleeding for chrissake you better put something on it it ll stop listen ya wan na play a little canasta or don tcha canasta for chrissake do you know what time it is by any chance it isn t late it s only around eleven eleven thirty only around ackley said listen i got ta get up and go to mass in the morning for chrissake you guy start hollering and fighting in the middle of the goddam what the hell wa the fight about anyhow it s a long story i don t wan na bore ya ackley i m thinking of your welfare i told him i never discussed my personal life with him in the first place he wa even more stupid than stradlater stradlater wa a goddam genius next to ackley hey i said is it okay if i sleep in ely s bed tonight he won t be back till tomorrow night will he i knew damn well he wouldn t ely went home damn near every week end i don t know when the hell he s coming back ackley said boy did that annoy me what the hell do you mean you don t know when he s coming back he never come back till sunday night doe he no but for chrissake i can t just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam bed if they want to that killed me i reached up from where i wa sitting on the floor and patted him on the goddam shoulder you re a prince ackley kid i said you know that no i mean it i can t just tell somebody they can sleep in you re a real prince you re a gentleman and a scholar kid i said he really wa too do you happen to have any cigarette by any chance say no or i ll drop dead no i don t a a matter of fact listen what the hell wa the fight about i didn t answer him all i did wa i got up and went over and looked out the window i felt so lonesome all of a sudden i almost wished i wa dead what the hell wa the fight about anyhow ackley said for about the fiftieth time he certainly wa a bore about that about you i said about me for chrissake yeah i wa defending your goddam honor stradlater said you had a lousy personality i couldn t let him get away with that stuff that got him excited he did no kidding he did i told him i wa only kidding and then i went over and laid down on ely s bed boy did i feel rotten i felt so damn lonesome this room stink i said i can smell your sock from way over here don tcha ever send them to the laundry if you don t like it you know what you can do ackley said what a witty guy how bout turning off the goddam light i didn t turn it off right away though i just kept laying there on ely s bed thinking about jane and all it just drove me stark staring mad when i thought about her and stradlater parked somewhere in that fat assed ed banky s car every time i thought about it i felt like jumping out the window the thing is you didn t know stradlater i knew him most guy at pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girl all the time like ackley for instance but old stradlater really did it i wa personally acquainted with at least two girl he gave the time to that s the truth tell me the story of your fascinating life ackley kid i said how bout turning off the goddam light i got ta get up for mass in the morning i got up and turned it off if it made him happy then i laid down on ely s bed again boy what re ya gon na do sleep in ely s bed ackley said he wa the perfect host i may i may not don t worry about it i m not worried about it only i d hate like hell if ely came in all of a sudden and found some guy relax i m not gon na sleep here i wouldn t abuse your goddam hospitality a couple of minute later he wa snoring like mad i kept laying there in the dark anyway though trying not to think about old jane and stradlater in that goddam ed banky s car but it wa almost impossible the trouble wa i knew that guy stradlater s technique that made it even worse we once double dated in ed banky s car and stradlater wa in the back with his date and i wa in the front with mine what a technique that guy had what he d do wa he d start snowing his date in this very quiet sincere voice like a if he wasn t only a very handsome guy but a nice sincere guy too i damn near puked listening to him his date kept saying no please please don t please but old stradlater kept snowing her in this abraham lincoln sincere voice and finally there d be this terrific silence in the back of the car it wa really embarrassing i don t think he gave that girl the time that night but damn near damn near while i wa laying there trying not to think i heard old stradlater come back from the can and go in our room you could hear him putting away his crumby toilet article and all and opening the window he wa a fresh air fiend then a little while later he turned off the light he didn t even look around to see where i wa at it wa even depressing out in the street you couldn t even hear any car any more i got feeling so lonesome and rotten i even felt like waking ackley up hey ackley i said in sort of a whisper so stradlater couldn t hear me through the shower curtain ackley didn t hear me though hey ackley he still didn t hear me he slept like a rock hey ackley he heard that all right what the hell s the matter with you he said i wa asleep for chrissake listen what s the routine on joining a monastery i asked him i wa sort of toying with the idea of joining one do you have to be a catholic and all certainly you have to be a catholic you bastard did you wake me just to ask me a dumb ques aah go back to sleep i m not gon na join one anyway the kind of luck i have i d probably join one with all the wrong kind of monk in it all stupid bastard or just bastard when i said that old ackley sat way the hell up in bed listen he said i don t care what you say about me or anything but if you start making crack about my goddam religion for chrissake relax i said nobody s making any crack about your goddam religion i got up off ely s bed and started towards the door i didn t want to hang around in that stupid atmosphere any more i stopped on the way though and picked up ackley s hand and gave him a big phony handshake he pulled it away from me what s the idea he said no idea i just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince that s all i said i said it in this very sincere voice you re ace ackley kid i said you know that wise guy someday somebody s gon na bash your i didn t even bother to listen to him i shut the damn door and went out in the corridor everybody wa asleep or out or home for the week end and it wa very very quiet and depressing in the corridor there wa this empty box of kolynos toothpaste outside leahy and hoffman s door and while i walked down towards the stair i kept giving it a boot with this sheep lined slipper i had on what i thought i d do i thought i might go down and see what old mal brossard wa doing but all of a sudden i changed my mind all of a sudden i decided what i d really do i d get the hell out of pencey right that same night and all i mean not wait till wednesday or anything i just didn t want to hang around any more it made me too sad and lonesome so what i decided to do i decided i d take a room in a hotel in new york some very inexpensive hotel and all and just take it easy till wednesday then on wednesday i d go home all rested up and feeling swell i figured my parent probably wouldn t get old thurmer s letter saying i d been given the ax till maybe tuesday or wednesday i didn t want to go home or anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all i didn t want to be around when they first got it my mother get very hysterical she s not too bad after she get something thoroughly digested though besides i sort of needed a little vacation my nerve were shot they really were anyway that s what i decided i d do so i went back to the room and turned on the light to start packing and all i already had quite a few thing packed old stradlater didn t even wake up i lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then i packed these two gladstone i have it only took me about two minute i m a very rapid packer one thing about packing depressed me a little i had to pack these brand new ice skate my mother had practically just sent me a couple of day before that depressed me i could see my mother going in spaulding s and asking the salesman a million dopy question and here i wa getting the ax again it made me feel pretty sad she bought me the wrong kind of skate i wanted racing skate and she bought hockey but it made me sad anyway almost every time somebody give me a present it end up making me sad after i got all packed i sort of counted my dough i don t remember exactly how much i had but i wa pretty loaded my grandmother d just sent me a wad about a week before i have this grandmother that s quite lavish with her dough she doesn t have all her marble any more she s old a hell and she keep sending me money for my birthday about four time a year anyway even though i wa pretty loaded i figured i could always use a few extra buck you never know so what i did wa i went down the hail and woke up frederick woodruff this guy i d lent my typewriter to i asked him how much he d give me for it he wa a pretty wealthy guy he said he didn t know he said he didn t much want to buy it finally he bought it though it cost about ninety buck and all he bought it for wa twenty he wa sore because i d woke him up when i wa all set to go when i had my bag and all i stood for a while next to the stair and took a last look down the goddam corridor i wa sort of cry i don t know why i put my red hunting hat on and turned the peak around to the back the way i liked it and then i yelled at the top of my goddam voice sleep tight ya moron i ll bet i woke up every bastard on the whole floor then i got the hell out some stupid guy had thrown peanut shell all over the stair and i damn near broke my crazy neck it wa too late to call up for a cab or anything so i walked the whole way to the station it wasn t too far but it wa cold a hell and the snow made it hard for walking and my gladstone kept banging hell out of my leg i sort of enjoyed the air and all though the only trouble wa the cold made my nose hurt and right under my upper lip where old stradlater d laid one on me he d smacked my lip right on my teeth and it wa pretty sore my ear were nice and warm though that hat i bought had earlap in it and i put them on i didn t give a damn how i looked nobody wa around anyway everybody wa in the sack i wa quite lucky when i got to the station because i only had to wait about ten minute for a train while i waited i got some snow in my hand and washed my face with it i still had quite a bit of blood on usually i like riding on train especially at night with the light on and the window so black and one of those guy coming up the aisle selling coffee and sandwich and magazine i usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazine if i m on a train at night i can usually even read one of those dumb story in a magazine without puking you know one of those story with a lot of phony lean jawed guy named david in it and a lot of phony girl named linda or marcia that are always lighting all the goddam david pipe for them i can even read one of those lousy story on a train at night usually but this time it wa different i just didn t feel like it i just sort of sat and not did anything all i did wa take off my hunting hat and put it in my pocket all of a sudden this lady got on at trenton and sat down next to me practically the whole car wa empty because it wa pretty late and all but she sat down next to me instead of an empty seat because she had this big bag with her and i wa sitting in the front seat she stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle where the conductor and everybody could trip over it she had these orchid on like she d just been to a big party or something she wa around forty or forty five i guess but she wa very good looking woman kill me they really do i don t mean i m oversexed or anything like that although i am quite sexy i just like them i mean they re always leaving their goddam bag out in the middle of the aisle anyway we were sitting there and all of a sudden she said to me excuse me but isn t that a pencey prep sticker she wa looking up at my suitcase up on the rack yes it is i said she wa right i did have a goddam pencey sticker on one of my gladstone very corny i ll admit oh do you go to pencey she said she had a nice voice a nice telephone voice mostly she should ve carried a goddam telephone around with her yes i do i said oh how lovely perhaps you know my son then ernest morrow he go to pencey yes i do he s in my class her son wa doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to pencey in the whole crumby history of the school he wa always going down the corridor after he d had a shower snapping his soggy old wet towel at people s ass that s exactly the kind of a guy he wa oh how nice the lady said but not corny she wa just nice and all i must tell ernest we met she said may i ask your name dear rudolf schmidt i told her i didn t feel like giving her my whole life history rudolf schmidt wa the name of the janitor of our dorm do you like pencey she asked me pencey it s not too bad it s not paradise or anything but it s a good a most school some of the faculty are pretty conscientious ernest just adores it i know he doe i said then i started shooting the old crap around a little bit he adapts himself very well to thing he really doe i mean he really know how to adapt himself do you think so she asked me she sounded interested a hell ernest sure i said then i watched her take off her glove boy wa she lousy with rock i just broke a nail getting out of a cab she said she looked up at me and sort of smiled she had a terrifically nice smile she really did most people have hardly any smile at all or a lousy one ernest s father and i sometimes worry about him she said we sometimes feel he s not a terribly good mixer how do you mean well he s a very sensitive boy he s really never been a terribly good mixer with other boy perhaps he take thing a little more seriously than he should at his age sensitive that killed me that guy morrow wa about a sensitive a a goddam toilet seat i gave her a good look she didn t look like any dope to me she looked like she might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she wa the mother of but you can t always tell with somebody s mother i mean mother are all slightly insane the thing is though i liked old morrow s mother she wa all right would you care for a cigarette i asked her she looked all around i don t believe this is a smoker rudolf she said rudolf that killed me that s all right we can smoke till they start screaming at u i said she took a cigarette off me and i gave her a light she looked nice smoking she inhaled and all but she didn t wolf the smoke down the way most woman around her age do she had a lot of charm she had quite a lot of sex appeal too if you really want to know she wa looking at me sort of funny i may be wrong but i believe your nose is bleeding dear she said all of a sudden i nodded and took out my handkerchief i got hit with a snowball i said one of those very icy one i probably would ve told her what really happened but it would ve taken too long i liked her though i wa beginning to feel sort of sorry i d told her my name wa rudolf schmidt old ernie i said he s one of the most popular boy at pencey did you know that no i didn t i nodded it really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him he s a funny guy a strange guy in lot of way know what i mean like when i first met him when i first met him i thought he wa kind of a snobbish person that s what i thought but he isn t he s just got this very original personality that take you a little while to get to know him old mr morrow didn t say anything but boy you should ve seen her i had her glued to her seat you take somebody s mother all they want to hear about is what a hot shot their son is then i really started chucking the old crap around did he tell you about the election i asked her the class election she shook her head i had her in a trance like i really did well a bunch of u wanted old ernie to be president of the class i mean he wa the unanimous choice i mean he wa the only boy that could really handle the job i said boy wa i chucking it but this other boy harry fencer wa elected and the reason he wa elected the simple and obvious reason wa because ernie wouldn t let u nominate him because he s so darn shy and modest and all he refused boy he s really shy you oughta make him try to get over that i looked at her didn t he tell you about it no he didn t i nodded that s ernie he wouldn t that s the one fault with him he s too shy and modest you really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally right that minute the conductor came around for old mr morrow s ticket and it gave me a chance to quit shooting it i m glad i shot it for a while though you take a guy like morrow that s always snapping their towel at people s ass really trying to hurt somebody with it they don t just stay a rat while they re a kid they stay a rat their whole life but i ll bet after all the crap i shot mr morrow ll keep thinking of him now a this very shy modest guy that wouldn t let u nominate him for president she might you can t tell mother aren t too sharp about that stuff would you care for a cocktail i asked her i wa feeling in the mood for one myself we can go in the club car all right dear are you allowed to order drink she asked me not snotty though she wa too charming and all to be snotty well no not exactly but i can usually get them on account of my heighth i said and i have quite a bit of gray hair i turned sideways and showed her my gray hair it fascinated hell out of her c mon join me why don t you i said i d ve enjoyed having her i really don t think i d better thank you so much though dear she said anyway the club car s most likely closed it s quite late you know she wa right i d forgotten all about what time it wa then she looked at me and asked me what i wa afraid she wa going to ask me ernest wrote that he d be home on wednesday that christmas vacation would start on wednesday she said i hope you weren t called home suddenly because of illness in the family she really looked worried about it she wasn t just being nosy you could tell no everybody s fine at home i said it s me i have to have this operation oh i m so sorry she said she really wa too i wa right away sorry i d said it but it wa too late it isn t very serious i have this tiny little tumor on the brain oh no she put her hand up to her mouth and all oh i ll be all right and everything it s right near the outside and it s a very tiny one they can take it out in about two minute then i started reading this timetable i had in my pocket just to stop lying once i get started i can go on for hour if i feel like it no kidding hour we didn t talk too much after that she started reading this vogue she had with her and i looked out the window for a while she got off at newark she wished me a lot of luck with the operation and all she kept calling me rudolf then she invited me to visit ernie during the summer at gloucester massachusetts she said their house wa right on the beach and they had a tennis court and all but i just thanked her and told her i wa going to south america with my grandmother which wa really a hot one because my grandmother hardly ever even go out of the house except maybe to go to a goddam matinee or something but i wouldn t visit that sonuvabitch morrow for all the dough in the world even if i wa desperate the first thing i did when i got off at penn station i went into this phone booth i felt like giving somebody a buzz i left my bag right outside the booth so that i could watch them but a soon a i wa inside i couldn t think of anybody to call up my brother d b wa in hollywood my kid sister phoebe go to bed around nine o clock so i couldn t call her up she wouldn t ve cared if i d woke her up but the trouble wa she wouldn t ve been the one that answered the phone my parent would be the one so that wa out then i thought of giving jane gallagher s mother a buzz and find out when jane s vacation started but i didn t feel like it besides it wa pretty late to call up then i thought of calling this girl i used to go around with quite frequently sally hayes because i knew her christmas vacation had started already she d written me this long phony letter inviting me over to help her trim the christmas tree christmas eve and all but i wa afraid her mother d answer the phone her mother knew my mother and i could picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother i wa in new york besides i wasn t crazy about talking to old mr hayes on the phone she once told sally i wa wild she said i wa wild and that i had no direction in life then i thought of calling up this guy that went to the whooton school when i wa there carl luce but i didn t like him much so i ended up not calling anybody i came out of the booth after about twenty minute or so and got my bag and walked over to that tunnel where the cab are and got a cab i m so damn absent minded i gave the driver my regular address just out of habit and all i mean i completely forgot i wa going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of day and not go home till vacation started i didn t think of it till we were halfway through the park then i said hey do you mind turning around when you get a chance i gave you the wrong address i want to go back downtown the driver wa sort of a wise guy i can t turn around here mac this here s a one way i ll have to go all the way to ninedieth street now i didn t want to start an argument okay i said then i thought of something all of a sudden hey listen i said you know those duck in that lagoon right near central park south that little lake by any chance do you happen to know where they go the duck when it get all frozen over do you happen to know by any chance i realized it wa only one chance in a million he turned around and looked at me like i wa a madman what re ya tryna do bud he said kid me no i wa just interested that s all he didn t say anything more so i didn t either until we came out of the park at ninetieth street then he said all right buddy where to well the thing is i don t want to stay at any hotel on the east side where i might run into some acquaintance of mine i m traveling incognito i said i hate saying corny thing like traveling incognito but when i m with somebody that s corny i always act corny too do you happen to know whose band s at the taft or the new yorker by any chance no idear mac well take me to the edmont then i said would you care to stop on the way and join me for a cocktail on me i m loaded can t do it mac sorry he certainly wa good company terrific personality we got to the edmont hotel and i checked in i d put on my red hunting cap when i wa in the cab just for the hell of it but i took it off before i checked in i didn t want to look like a screwball or something which is really ironic i didn t know then that the goddam hotel wa full of pervert and moron screwball all over the place they gave me this very crumby room with nothing to look out of the window at except the other side of the hotel i didn t care much i wa too depressed to care whether i had a good view or not the bellboy that showed me to the room wa this very old guy around sixty five he wa even more depressing than the room wa he wa one of those bald guy that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness i d rather be bald than do that anyway what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixty five year old carrying people s suitcase and waiting around for a tip i suppose he wasn t too intelligent or anything but it wa terrible anyway after he left i looked out the window for a while with my coat on and all i didn t have anything else to do you d be surprised what wa going on on the other side of the hotel they didn t even bother to pull their shade down i saw one guy a gray haired very distinguished looking guy with only his short on do something you wouldn t believe me if i told you first he put his suitcase on the bed then he took out all these woman s clothes and put them on real woman s clothes silk stocking high heeled shoe brassiere and one of those corset with the strap hanging down and all then he put on this very tight black evening dress i swear to god then he started walking up and down the room taking these very small step the way a woman doe and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror he wa all alone too unless somebody wa in the bathroom i couldn t see that much then in the window almost right over his i saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouth at each other it probably wa highball not water but i couldn t see what they had in their glass anyway first he d take a swallow and squirt it all over her then she did it to him they took turn for god s sake you should ve seen them they were in hysteric the whole time like it wa the funniest thing that ever happened i m not kidding the hotel wa lousy with pervert i wa probably the only normal bastard in the whole place and that isn t saying much i damn near sent a telegram to old stradlater telling him to take the first train to new york he d have been the king of the hotel the trouble wa that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch even if you don t want it to be for instance that girl that wa getting water squirted all over her face she wa pretty good looking i mean that s my big trouble in my mind i m probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw sometimes i can think of very crumby stuff i wouldn t mind doing if the opportunity came up i can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun in a crumby way and if you were both sort of drunk and all to get a girl and squirt water or something all over each other s face the thing is though i don t like the idea it stink if you analyze it i think if you don t really like a girl you shouldn t horse around with her at all and if you do like her then you re supposed to like her face and if you like her face you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it like squirting water all over it it s really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes girl aren t too much help either when you start trying not to get too crumby when you start trying not to spoil anything really good i knew this one girl a couple of year ago that wa even crumbier than i wa boy wa she crumby we had a lot of fun though for a while in a crumby way sex is something i really don t understand too hot you never know where the hell you are i keep making up these sex rule for myself and then i break them right away last year i made a rule that i wa going to quit horsing around with girl that deep down gave me a pain in the as i broke it though the same week i made it the same night a a matter of fact i spent the whole night necking with a terrible phony named anne louise sherman sex is something i just don t understand i swear to god i don t i started toying with the idea while i kept standing there of giving old jane a buzz i mean calling her long distance at b m where she went instead of calling up her mother to find out when she wa coming home you weren t supposed to call student up late at night but i had it all figured out i wa going to tell whoever answered the phone that i wa her uncle i wa going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and i had to speak to her immediately it would ve worked too the only reason i didn t do it wa because i wasn t in the mood if you re not in the mood you can t do that stuff right after a while i sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarette i wa feeling pretty horny i have to admit it then all of a sudden i got this idea i took out my wallet and started looking for this address a guy i met at a party last summer that went to princeton gave me finally i found it it wa all a funny color from my wallet but you could still read it it wa the address of this girl that wasn t exactly a whore or anything but that didn t mind doing it once in a while this princeton guy told me he brought her to a dance at princeton once and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her she used to be a burlesque stripper or something anyway i went over to the phone and gave her a buzz her name wa faith cavendish and she lived at the stanford arm hotel on sixty fifth and broadway a dump no doubt for a while i didn t think she wa home or something nobody kept answering then finally somebody picked up the phone hello i said i made my voice quite deep so that she wouldn t suspect my age or anything i have a pretty deep voice anyway hello this woman s voice said none too friendly either is this miss faith cavendish who s this she said who s calling me up at this crazy goddam hour that sort of scared me a little bit well i know it s quite late i said in this very mature voice and all i hope you ll forgive me but i wa very anxious to get in touch with you i said it suave a hell i really did who is this she said well you don t know me but i m a friend of eddie birdsell s he suggested that if i were in town sometime we ought to get together for a cocktail or two who you re a friend of who boy she wa a real tigress over the phone she wa damn near yelling at me edmund birdsell eddie birdsell i said i couldn t remember if his name wa edmund or edward i only met him once at a goddam stupid party i don t know anybody by that name jack and if you think i enjoy bein woke up in the middle eddie birdsell from princeton i said you could tell she wa running the name over in her mind and all birdsell birdsell from princeton princeton college that s right i said you from princeton college well approximately oh how is eddie she said this is certainly a peculiar time to call a person up though jesus christ he s fine he asked to be remembered to you well thank you remember me to him she said he s a grand person what s he doing now she wa getting friendly a hell all of a sudden oh you know same old stuff i said how the hell did i know what he wa doing i hardly knew the guy i didn t even know if he wa still at princeton look i said would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere by any chance do you have any idea what time it is she said what s your name anyhow may i ask she wa getting an english accent all of a sudden you sound a little on the young side i laughed thank you for the compliment i said suave a hell holden caulfield s my name i should ve given her a phony name but i didn t think of it well look mr cawffle i m not in the habit of making engagement in the middle of the night i m a working gal tomorrow s sunday i told her well anyway i got ta get my beauty sleep you know how it is i thought we might have just one cocktail together it isn t too late well you re very sweet she said where ya callin from where ya at now anyways me i m in a phone

i could come up to your place well ordinary i d say grand i mean i d love to have you drop up for a cocktail but my roommate happens to be ill she s been laying here all night without a wink of sleep she just this minute closed her eye and all i mean oh that s too bad where ya stopping at perhaps we could get together for cocktail tomorrow i can t make it tomorrow i said tonight s the only time i can make it what a dope i wa i shouldn t ve said that oh well i m awfully sorry i ll say hello to eddie for you willya do that i hope you enjoy your stay in new york it s a grand place i know it is thanks good night i said then i hung up boy i really fouled that up i should ve at least made it for cocktail or something it wa still pretty early i m not sure what time it wa but it wasn t too late the one thing i hate to do is go to bed when i m not even tired so i opened my suitcase and took out a clean shirt and then i went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt what i thought i d do i thought i d go downstairs and see what the hell wa going on in the lavender room they had this night club the lavender room in the hotel while i wa changing my shirt i damn near gave my kid sister phoebe a buzz though i certainly felt like talking to her on the phone somebody with sense and all but i couldn t take a chance on giving her a buzz because she wa only a little kid and she wouldn t have been up let alone anywhere near the phone i thought of maybe hanging up if my parent answered but that wouldn t ve worked either they d know it wa me my mother always know it s me she s psychic but i certainly wouldn t have minded shooting the crap with old phoebe for a while you should see her you never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life she s really smart i mean she s had all a s ever since she started school a a matter of fact i m the only dumb one in the family my brother d b s a writer and all and my brother allie the one that died that i told you about wa a wizard i m the only really dumb one but you ought to see old phoebe she ha this sort of red hair a little bit like allie s wa that s very short in the summertime in the summertime she stick it behind her ear she ha nice pretty little ear in the wintertime it s pretty long though sometimes my mother braid it and sometimes she doesn t it s really nice though she s only ten she s quite skinny like me but nice skinny roller skate skinny i watched her once from the window when she wa crossing over fifth avenue to go to the park and that s what she is roller skate skinny you d like her i mean if you tell old phoebe something she know exactly what the hell you re talking about i mean you can even take her anywhere with you if you take her to a lousy movie for instance she know it s a lousy movie if you take her to a pretty good movie she know it s a pretty good movie d b and i took her to see this french movie the baker s wife with raimu in it it killed her her favorite is the step though with robert donat she know the whole goddam movie by heart because i ve taken her to see it about ten time when old donat come up to this scotch farmhouse for instance when he s running away from the cop and all phoebe ll say right out loud in the movie right when the scotch guy in the picture say it can you eat the herring she know all the talk by heart and when this professor in the picture that s really a german spy stick up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing to show robert donat old phoebe beat him to it she hold up her little finger at me in the dark right in front of my face she s all right you d like her the only trouble is she s a little too affectionate sometimes she s very emotional for a child she really is something else she doe she writes book all the time only she doesn t finish them they re all about some kid named hazel weatherfield only old phoebe spell it hazle old hazle weatherfield is a girl detective she s supposed to be an orphan but her old man keep showing up her old man s always a tall attractive gentleman about year of age that kill me old phoebe i swear to god you d like her she wa smart even when she wa a very tiny little kid when she wa a very tiny little kid i and allie used to take her to the park with u especially on sunday allie had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on sunday and we used to take old phoebe with u she d wear white glove and walk right between u like a lady and all and when allie and i were having some conversation about thing in general old phoebe d be listening sometimes you d forget she wa around because she wa such a little kid but she d let you know she d interrupt you all the time she d give allie or i a push or something and say who who said that bobby or the lady and we d tell her who said it and she d say oh and go right on listening and all she killed allie too i mean he liked her too she s ten now and not such a tiny little kid any more but she still kill everybody everybody with any sense anyway anyway she wa somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone but i wa too afraid my parent would answer and then they d find out i wa in new york and kicked out of pencey and all so i just finished putting on my shirt then i got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what wa going on except for a few pimpy looking guy and a few whory looking blonde the lobby wa pretty empty but you could hear the band playing in the lavender room and so i went in there it wasn t very crowded but they gave me a lousy table anyway way in the back i should ve waved a buck under the head waiter s nose in new york boy money really talk i m not kidding the band wa putrid buddy singer very brassy but not good brassy corny brassy also there were very few people around my age in the place in fact nobody wa around my age they were mostly old show offy looking guy with their date except at the table right next to me at the table right next to me there were these three girl around thirty or so the whole three of them were pretty ugly and they all had on the kind of hat that you knew they didn t really live in new york but one of them the blonde one wasn t too bad she wa sort of cute the blonde one and i started giving her the old eye a little bit but just then the waiter came up for my order i ordered a scotch and soda and told him not to mix it i said it fast a hell because if you hem and haw they think you re under twenty one and won t sell you any intoxicating liquor i had trouble with him anyway though i m sorry sir he said but do you have some verification of your age your driver s license perhaps i gave him this very cold stare like he d insulted the hell out of me and asked him do i look like i m under twenty one i m sorry sir but we have our okay okay i said i figured the hell with it bring me a coke he started to go away but i called him back can tcha stick a little rum in it or something i asked him i asked him very nicely and all i can t sit in a corny place like this cold sober can tcha stick a little rum in it or something i m very sorry sir he said and beat it on me i didn t hold it against him though they lose their job if they get caught selling to a minor i m a goddam minor i started giving the three witch at the next table the eye again that is the blonde one the other two were strictly from hunger i didn t do it crudely though i just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all what they did though the three of them when i did it they started giggling like moron they probably thought i wa too young to give anybody the once over that annoyed hell out of me you d ve thought i wanted to marry them or something i should ve given them the freeze after they did that but the trouble wa i really felt like dancing i m very fond of dancing sometimes and that wa one of the time so all of a sudden i sort of leaned over and said would any of you girl care to dance i didn t ask them crudely or anything very suave in fact but god damn it they thought that wa a panic too they started giggling some more i m not kidding they were three real moron c mon i said i ll dance with you one at a time all right how bout it c mon i really felt like dancing finally the blonde one got up to dance with me because you could tell i wa really talking to her and we walked out to the dance floor the other two grools nearly had hysteric when we did i certainly must ve been very hard up to even bother with any of them but it wa worth it the blonde wa some dancer she wa one of the best dancer i ever danced with i m not kidding some of these very stupid girl can really knock you out on a dance floor you take a really smart girl and half the time she s trying to lead you around the dance floor or else she s such a lousy dancer the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her you really can dance i told the blonde one you oughta be a pro i mean it i danced with a pro once and you re twice a good a she wa did you ever hear of marco and miranda what she said she wasn t even listening to me she wa looking all around the place i said did you ever hear of marco and miranda i don t know no i don t know well they re dancer she s a dancer she s not too hot though she doe everything she s supposed to but she s not so hot anyway you know when a girl s really a terrific dancer wudga say she said she wasn t listening to me even her mind wa wandering all over the place i said do you know when a girl s really a terrific dancer uh uh well where i have my hand on your back if i think there isn t anything underneath my hand no can no leg no foot no anything then the girl s really a terrific dancer she wasn t listening though so i ignored her for a while we just danced god could that dopey girl dance buddy singer and his stinking band wa playing just one of those thing and even they couldn t ruin it entirely it s a swell song i didn t try any trick stuff while we danced i hate a guy that doe a lot of show off tricky stuff on the dance floor but i wa moving her around plenty and she stayed with me the funny thing is i thought she wa enjoying it too till all of a sudden she came out with this very dumb remark i and my girl friend saw peter lorre last night she said the movie actor in person he wa buyin a newspaper he s cute you re lucky i told her you re really lucky you know that she wa really a moron but what a dancer i could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the top of her dopey head you know right where the part is and all she got sore when i did it hey what s the idea nothing no idea you really can dance i said i have a kid sister that s only in the goddam fourth grade you re about a good a she is and she can dance better than anybody living or dead watch your language if you don t mind what a lady boy a queen for chrissake where you girl from i asked her she didn t answer me though she wa busy looking around for old peter lorre to show up i guess where you girl from i asked her again what she said where you girl from don t answer if you don t feel like it i don t want you to strain yourself seattle washington she said she wa doing me a big favor to tell me you re a very good conversationalist i told her you know that what i let it drop it wa over her head anyway do you feel like jitterbugging a little bit if they play a fast one not corny jitterbug not jump or anything just nice and easy everybody ll all sit down when they play a fast one except the old guy and the fat guy and we ll have plenty of room okay it s immaterial to me she said hey how old are you anyhow that annoyed me for some reason oh christ don t spoil it i said i m twelve for chrissake i m big for my age listen i toleja about that i don t like that type language she said if you re gon na use that type language i can go sit down with my girl friend you know i apologized like a madman because the band wa starting a fast one she started jitterbugging with me but just very nice and easy not corny she wa really good all you had to do wa touch her and when she turned around her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all she knocked me out i mean it i wa half in love with her by the time we sat down that s the thing about girl every time they do something pretty even if they re not much to look at or even if they re sort of stupid you fall half in love with them and then you never know where the hell you are girl jesus christ they can drive you crazy they really can they didn t invite me to sit down at their table mostly because they were too ignorant but i sat down anyway the blonde i d been dancing with s name wa bernice something crab or krebs the two ugly one name were marty and laverne i told them my name wa jim steele just for the hell of it then i tried to get them in a little intelligent conversation but it wa practically impossible you had to twist their arm you could hardly tell which wa the stupidest of the three of them and the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room like a if they expected a flock of goddam movie star to come in any minute they probably thought movie star always hung out in the lavender room when they came to new york instead of the stork club or el morocco and all anyway it took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in seattle they all worked in the same insurance office i asked them if they liked it but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dope i thought the two ugly one marty and laverne were sister but they got very insulted when i asked them you could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one and you couldn t blame them but it wa very amusing anyway i danced with them all the whole three of them one at a time the one ugly one laverne wasn t too bad a dancer but the other one old marty wa murder old marty wa like dragging the statue of liberty around the floor the only way i could even half enjoy myself dragging her around wa if i amused myself a little so i told her i just saw gary cooper the movie star on the other side of the floor where she asked me excited a hell where aw you just missed him he just went out why didn t you look when i told you she practically stopped dancing and started looking over everybody s head to see if she could see him oh shoot she said i d just about broken her heart i really had i wa sorry a hell i d kidded her some people you shouldn t kid even if they deserve it here s what wa very funny though when we got back to the table old marty told the other two that gary cooper had just gone out boy old laverne and bernice nearly committed suicide when they heard that they got all excited and asked marty if she d seen him and all old mart said she d only caught a glimpse of him that killed me the bar wa closing up for the night so i bought them all two drink apiece quick before it closed and i ordered two more coke for myself the goddam table wa lousy with glass the one ugly one laverne kept kidding me because i wa only drinking coke she had a sterling sense of humor she and old marty were drinking tom collins in the middle of december for god s sake they didn t know any better the blonde one old bernice wa drinking bourbon and water she wa really putting it away too the whole three of them kept looking for movie star the whole time they hardly talked even to each other old marty talked more than the other two she kept saying these very corny boring thing like calling the can the little girl room and she thought buddy singer s poor old beat up clarinet player wa really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of ice cold hot lick she called his clarinet a licorice stick wa she corny the other ugly one laverne thought she wa a very witty type she kept asking me to call up my father and ask him what he wa doing tonight she kept asking me if my father had a date or not four time she asked me that she wa certainly witty old bernice the blonde one didn t say hardly anything at all every time i d ask her something she said what that can get on your nerve after a while all of a sudden when they finished their drink all three of them stood up on me and said they had to get to bed they said they were going to get up early to see the first show at radio city music hall i tried to get them to stick around for a while but they wouldn t so we said good by and all i told them i d look them up in seattle sometime if i ever got there but i doubt if i ever will look them up i mean with cigarette and all the check came to about thirteen buck i think they should ve at least offered to pay for the drink they had before i joined them i wouldn t ve let them naturally but they should ve at least offered i didn t care much though they were so ignorant and they had those sad fancy hat on and all and that business about getting up early to see the first show at radio city music hall depressed me if somebody some girl in an awful looking hat for instance come all the way to new york from seattle washington for god s sake and end up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at radio city music hall it make me so depressed i can t stand it i d ve bought the whole three of them a hundred drink if only they hadn t told me that i left the lavender room pretty soon after they did they were closing it up anyway and the band had quit a long time ago in the first place it wa one of those place that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with or unless the waiter let you buy real drink instead of just coke there isn t any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk or unless you re with some girl that really knock you out all of a sudden on my way out to the lobby i got old jane gallagher on the brain again i got her on and i couldn t get her off i sat down in this vomity looking chair in the lobby and thought about her and stradlater sitting in that goddam ed banky s car and though i wa pretty damn sure old stradlater hadn t given her the time i know old jane like a book i still couldn t get her off my brain i knew her like a book i really did i mean besides checker she wa quite fond of all athletic sport and after i got to know her the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon i really got to know her quite intimately i don t mean it wa anything physical or anything it wasn t but we saw each other all the time you don t always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl the way i met her this doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn and my mother got very irritated about it she called up jane s mother and made a big stink about it my mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff then what happened a couple of day later i saw jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool at the club and i said hello to her i knew she lived in the house next to ours but i d never conversed with her before or anything she gave me the big freeze when i said hello that day though i had a helluva time convincing her that i didn t give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself he could do it in the living room for all i cared anyway after that jane and i got to be friend and all i played golf with her that same afternoon she lost eight ball i remember eight i had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eye when she took a swing at the ball i improved her game immensely though i m a very good golfer if i told you what i go around in you probably wouldn t believe me i almost wa once in a movie short but i changed my mind at the last minute i figured that anybody that hate the movie a much a i do i d be a phony if i let them stick me in a movie short she wa a funny girl old jane i wouldn t exactly describe her a strictly beautiful she knocked me out though she wa sort of muckle mouthed i mean when she wa talking and she got excited about something her mouth sort of went in about fifty direction her lip and all that killed me and she never really closed it all the way her mouth it wa always just a little bit open especially when she got in her golf stance or when she wa reading a book she wa always reading and she read very good book she read a lot of poetry and all she wa the only one outside my family that i ever showed allie s baseball mitt to with all the poem written on it she d never met allie or anything because that wa her first summer in maine before that she went to cape cod but i told her quite a lot about him she wa interested in that kind of stuff my mother didn t like her too much i mean my mother always thought jane and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn t say hello my mother saw them in the village a lot because jane used to drive to market with her mother in this lasalle convertible they had my mother didn t think jane wa pretty even i did though i just liked the way she looked that s all i remember this one afternoon it wa the only time old jane and i ever got close to necking even it wa a saturday and it wa raining like a bastard out and i wa over at her house on the porch they had this big screened in porch we were playing checker i used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn t take her king out of the back row but i didn t kid her much though you never wanted to kid jane too much i think i really like it best when you can kid the pant off a girl when the opportunity arises but it s a funny thing the girl i like best are the one i never feel much like kidding sometimes i think they d like it if you kidded them in fact i know they would but it s hard to get started once you ve known them a pretty long time and never kidded them anyway i wa telling you about that afternoon jane and i came close to necking it wa raining like hell and we were out on her porch and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother wa married to came out on the porch and asked jane if there were any cigarette in the house i didn t know him too well or anything but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn t talk to you much unless he wanted something off you he had a lousy personality anyway old jane wouldn t answer him when he asked her if she knew where there wa any cigarette so the guy asked her again but she still wouldn t answer him she didn t even look up from the game finally the guy went inside the house when he did i asked jane what the hell wa going on she wouldn t even answer me then she made out like she wa concentrating on her next move in the game and all then all of a sudden this tear plopped down on the checkerboard on one of the red square boy i can still see it she just rubbed it into the board with her finger i don t know why but it bothered hell out of me so what i did wa i went over and made her move over on the glider so that i could sit down next to her i practically sat down in her lap a a matter of fact then she really started to cry and the next thing i knew i wa kissing her all over anywhere her eye her nose her forehead her eyebrow and all her ear her whole face except her mouth and all she sort of wouldn t let me get to her mouth anyway it wa the closest we ever got to necking after a while she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had that knocked me out and we went to a goddam movie i asked her on the way if mr cudahy that wa the booze hound s name had ever tried to get wise with her she wa pretty young but she had this terrific figure and i wouldn t ve put it past that cudahy bastard she said no though i never did find out what the hell wa the matter some girl you practically never find out what s the matter i don t want you to get the idea she wa a goddam icicle or something just because we never necked or horsed around much she wasn t i held hand with her all the time for instance that doesn t sound like much i realize but she wa terrific to hold hand with most girl if you hold hand with them their goddam hand dy on you or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time a if they were afraid they d bore you or something jane wa different we d get into a goddam movie or something and right away we d start holding hand and we wouldn t quit till the movie wa over and without changing the position or making a big deal out of it you never even worried with jane whether your hand wa sweaty or not all you knew wa you were happy you really were one other thing i just thought of one time in this movie jane did something that just about knocked me out the newsreel wa on or something and all of a sudden i felt this hand on the back of my neck and it wa jane s it wa a funny thing to do i mean she wa quite young and all and most girl if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebody s neck they re around twenty five or thirty and usually they re doing it to their husband or their little kid i do it to my kid sister phoebe once in a while for instance but if a girl s quite young and all and she doe it it s so pretty it just about kill you anyway that s what i wa thinking about while i sat in that vomity looking chair in the lobby old jane every time i got to the part about her out with stradlater in that damn ed banky s car it almost drove me crazy i knew she wouldn t let him get to first base with her but it drove me crazy anyway i don t even like to talk about it if you want to know the truth there wa hardly anybody in the lobby any more even all the whory looking blonde weren t around any more and all of a sudden i felt like getting the hell out of the place it wa too depressing and i wasn t tired or anything so i went up to my room and put on my coat i also took a look out the window to see if all the pervert were still in action but the light and all were out now i went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to ernie s ernie s is this night club in greenwich village that my brother d b used to go to quite frequently before he went out to hollywood and prostituted himself he used to take me with him once in a while ernie s a big fat colored guy that play the piano he s a terrific snob and he won t hardly even talk to you unless you re a big shot or a celebrity or something but he can really play the piano he s so good he s almost corny in fact i don t exactly know what i mean by that but i mean it i certainly like to hear him play but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over i think it s because sometimes when he play he sound like the kind of guy that won t talk to you unless you re a big shot the cab i had wa a real old one that smelled like someone d just tossed his cooky in it i always get those vomity kind of cab if i go anywhere late at night what made it worse it wa so quiet and lonesome out even though it wa saturday night i didn t see hardly anybody on the street now and then you just saw a man and a girl crossing a street with their arm around each other s waist and all or a bunch of hoodlumy looking guy and their date all of them laughing like hyena at something you could bet wasn t funny new york s terrible when somebody laugh on the street very late at night you can hear it for mile it make you feel so lonesome and depressed i kept wishing i could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old phoebe but finally after i wa riding a while the cab driver and i sort of struck up a conversation his name wa horwitz he wa a much better guy than the other driver i d had anyway i thought maybe he might know about the duck hey horwitz i said you ever pas by the lagoon in central park down by central park south the what the lagoon that little lake like there where the duck are you know yeah what about it well you know the duck that swim around in it in the springtime and all do you happen to know where they go in the wintertime by any chance where who go the duck do you know by any chance i mean doe somebody come around in a truck or something and take them away or do they fly away by themselves go south or something old horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me he wa a very impatient type guy he wasn t a bad guy though how the hell should i know he said how the hell should i know a stupid thing like that well don t get sore about it i said he wa sore about it or something who s sore nobody s sore i stopped having a conversation with him if he wa going to get so damn touchy about it but he started it up again himself he turned all the way around again and said the fish don t go no place they stay right where they are the fish right in the goddam lake the fish that s different the fish is different i m talking about the duck i said what s different about it nothin s different about it horwitz said everything he said he sounded sore about something it s tougher for the fish the winter and all than it is for the duck for chrissake use your head for chrissake i didn t say anything for about a minute then i said all right what do they do the fish and all when that whole little lake s a solid block of ice people skating on it and all old horwitz turned around again what the hellaya mean what do they do he yelled at me they stay right where they are for chrissake they can t just ignore the ice they can t just ignore it who s ignoring it nobody s ignoring it horwitz said he got so damn excited and all i wa afraid he wa going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something they live right in the goddam ice it s their nature for chrissake they get frozen right in one position for the whole winter yeah what do they eat then i mean if they re frozen solid they can t swim around looking for food and all their body for chrissake what sa matter with ya their body take in nutrition and all right through the goddam seaweed and crap that s in the ice they got their pore open the whole time that s their nature for chrissake see what i mean he turned way the hell around again to look at me oh i said i let it drop i wa afraid he wa going to crack the damn taxi up or something besides he wa such a touchy guy it wasn t any pleasure discussing anything with him would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere i said he didn t answer me though i guess he wa still thinking i asked him again though he wa a pretty good guy quite amusing and all i ain t got no time for no liquor bud he said how the hell old are you anyways why ain tcha home in bed i m not tired when i got out in front of ernie s and paid the fare old horwitz brought up the fish again he certainly had it on his mind listen he said if you wa a fish mother nature d take care of you wouldn t she right you don t think them fish just die when it get to be winter do ya no but you re goddam right they don t horwitz said and drove off like a bat out of hell he wa about the touchiest guy i ever met everything you said made him sore even though it wa so late old ernie s wa jampacked mostly with prep school jerk and college jerk almost every damn school in the world get out earlier for christmas vacation than the school i go to you could hardly check your coat it wa so crowded it wa pretty quiet though because ernie wa playing the piano it wa supposed to be something holy for god s sake when he sat down at the piano nobody s that good about three couple besides me were waiting for table and they were all shoving and standing on tiptoe to get a look at old ernie while he played he had a big damn mirror in front of the piano with this big spotlight on him so that everybody could watch his face while he played you couldn t see his finger while he played just his big old face big deal i m not too sure what the name of the song wa that he wa playing when i came in but whatever it wa he wa really stinking it up he wa putting all these dumb show offy ripple in the high note and a lot of other very tricky stuff that give me a pain in the as you should ve heard the crowd though when he wa finished you would ve puked they went mad they were exactly the same moron that laugh like hyena in the movie at stuff that isn t funny i swear to god if i were a piano player or an actor or something and all those dope thought i wa terrific i d hate it i wouldn t even want them to clap for me people always clap for the wrong thing if i were a piano player i d play it in the goddam closet anyway when he wa finished and everybody wa clapping their head off old ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very phony humble bow like a if he wa a helluva humble guy besides being a terrific piano player it wa very phony i mean him being such a big snob and all in a funny way though i felt sort of sorry for him when he wa finished i don t even think he know any more when he s playing right or not it isn t all his fault i partly blame all those dope that clap their head off they d foul up anybody if you gave them a chance anyway it made me feel depressed and lousy again and i damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel but it wa too early and i didn t feel much like being all alone they finally got me this stinking table right up against a wall and behind a goddam post where you couldn t see anything it wa one of those tiny little table that if the people at the next table don t get up to let you by and they never do the bastard you practically have to climb into your chair i ordered a scotch and soda which is my favorite drink next to frozen daiquiri if you were only around six year old you could get liquor at ernie s the place wa so dark and all and besides nobody cared how old you were you could even be a dope fiend and nobody d care i wa surrounded by jerk i m not kidding at this other tiny table right to my left practically on top of me there wa this funny looking guy and this funny looking girl they were around my age or maybe just a little older it wa funny you could see they were being careful a hell not to drink up the minimum too fast i listened to their conversation for a while because i didn t have anything else to do he wa telling her about some pro football game he d seen that afternoon he gave her every single goddam play in the whole game i m not kidding he wa the most boring guy i ever listened to and you could tell his date wasn t even interested in the goddam game but she wa even funnier looking than he wa so i guess she had to listen real ugly girl have it tough i feel so sorry for them sometimes sometimes i can t even look at them especially if they re with some dopey guy that s telling them all about a goddam football game on my right the conversation wa even worse though on my right there wa this very joe yale looking guy in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty looking tattersall vest all those ivy league bastard look alike my father want me to go to yale or maybe princeton but i swear i wouldn t go to one of those ivy league college if i wa dying for god s sake anyway this joe yale looking guy had a terrific looking girl with him boy she wa good looking but you should ve heard the conversation they were having in the first place they were both slightly crocked what he wa doing he wa giving her a feel under the table and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide his date kept saying to him how horrible don t darling please don t not here imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time they killed me i certainly began to feel like a prize horse s as though sitting there all by myself there wasn t anything to do except smoke and drink what i did do though i told the waiter to ask old ernie if he d care to join me for a drink i told him to tell him i wa d b s brother i don t think he ever even gave him my message though those bastard never give your message to anybody all of a sudden this girl came up to me and said holden caulfield her name wa lillian simmons my brother d b used to go around with her for a while she had very big knocker hi i said i tried to get up naturally but it wa some job getting up in a place like that she had some navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his as how marvelous to see you old lillian simmons said strictly a phony how s your big brother that s all she really wanted to know he s fine he s in hollywood in hollywood how marvelous what s he doing i don t know writing i said i didn t feel like discussing it you could tell she thought it wa a big deal his being in hollywood almost everybody doe mostly people who ve never read any of his story it drive me crazy though how exciting old lillian said then she introduced me to the navy guy his name wa commander blop or something he wa one of those guy that think they re being a pansy if they don t break around forty of your finger when they shake hand with you god i hate that stuff are you all alone baby old lillian asked me she wa blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle you could tell she liked to block up a lot of traffic this waiter wa waiting for her to move out of the way but she didn t even notice him it wa funny you could tell the waiter didn t like her much you could tell even the navy guy didn t like her much even though he wa dating her and i didn t like her much nobody did you had to feel sort of sorry for her in a way don t you have a date baby she asked me i wa standing up now and she didn t even tell me to sit down she wa the type that keep you standing up for hour isn t he handsome she said to the navy guy holden you re getting handsomer by the minute the navy guy told her to come on he told her they were blocking up the whole aisle holden come join u old lillian said bring your drink i wa just leaving i told her i have to meet somebody you could tell she wa just trying to get in good with me so that i d tell old d b about it well you little so and so all right for you tell your big brother i hate him when you see him then she left the navy guy and i told each other we were glad to ve met each other which always kill me i m always saying glad to ve met you to somebody i m not at all glad i met if you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff though after i d told her i had to meet somebody i didn t have any goddam choice except to leave i couldn t even stick around to hear old ernie play something halfway decent but i certainly wasn t going to sit down at a table with old lillian simmons and that navy guy and be bored to death so i left it made me mad though when i wa getting my coat people are always ruining thing for you i walked all the way back to the hotel forty one gorgeous block i didn t do it because i felt like walking or anything it wa more because i didn t feel like getting in and out of another taxicab sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicab the same way you get tired riding in elevator all of a sudden you have to walk no matter how far or how high up when i wa a kid i used to walk all the way up to our apartment very frequently twelve story you wouldn t even have known it had snowed at all there wa hardly any snow on the sidewalk but it wa freezing cold and i took my red hunting hat out of my pocket and put it on i didn t give a damn how i looked i even put the earlap down i wished i knew who d swiped my glove at pencey because my hand were freezing not that i d have done much about it even if i had known i m one of these very yellow guy i try not to show it but i am for instance if i d found out at pencey who d stolen my glove i probably would ve gone down to the crook s room and said okay how bout handing over those glove then the crook that had stolen them probably would ve said his voice very innocent and all what glove then what i probably would ve done i d have gone in his closet and found the glove somewhere hidden in his goddam galosh or something for instance i d have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said i suppose these are your goddam glove then the crook probably would ve given me this very phony innocent look and said i never saw those glove before in my life if they re yours take em i don t want the goddam thing then i probably would ve just stood there for about five minute i d have the damn glove right in my hand and all but i d feel i ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something break his goddam jaw only i wouldn t have the gut to do it i d just stand there trying to look tough what i might do i might say something very cutting and snotty to rile him up instead of socking him in the jaw anyway if i did say something very cutting and snotty he d probably get up and come over to me and say listen caulfield are you calling me a crook then instead of saying you re goddam right i am you dirty crooked bastard all i probably would ve said would be all i know is my goddam glove were in your goddam galosh right away then the guy would know for sure that i wasn t going to take a sock at him and he probably would ve said listen let s get this straight are you calling me a thief then i probably would ve said nobody s calling anybody a thief all i know is my glove were in your goddam galosh it could go on like that for hour finally though i d leave his room without even taking a sock at him i d probably go down to the can and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror anyway that s what i thought about the whole way back to the hotel it s no fun to he yellow maybe i m not all yellow i don t know i think maybe i m just partly yellow and partly the type that doesn t give much of a damn if they lose their glove one of my trouble is i never care too much when i lose something it used to drive my mother crazy when i wa a kid some guy spend day looking for something they lost i never seem to have anything that if i lost it i d care too much maybe that s why i m partly yellow it s no excuse though it really isn t what you should be is not yellow at all if you re supposed to sock somebody in the jaw and you sort of feel like doing it you should do it i m just no good at it though i d rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw i hate fist fight i don t mind getting hit so much although i m not crazy about it naturally but what scare me most in a fist fight is the guy s face i can t stand looking at the other guy s face is my trouble it wouldn t be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something it s a funny kind of yellowness when you come to think of it but it s yellowness all right i m not kidding myself the more i thought about my glove and my yellowness the more depressed i got and i decided while i wa walking and all to stop off and have a drink somewhere i d only had three drink at ernie s and i didn t even finish the last one one thing i have it s a terrific capacity i can drink all night and not even show it if i m in the mood once at the whooton school this other boy raymond goldfarb and i bought a pint of scotch and drank it in the chapel one saturday night where nobody d see u he got stinking but i hardly didn t even show it i just got very cool and nonchalant i puked before i went to bed but i didn t really have to i forced myself anyway before i got to the hotel i started to go in this dumpy looking bar but two guy came out drunk a hell and wanted to know where the subway wa one of them wa this very cuban looking guy and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my face while i gave him direction i ended up not even going in the damn bar i just went back to the hotel the whole lobby wa empty it smelled like fifty million dead cigar it really did i wasn t sleepy or anything but i wa feeling sort of lousy depressed and all i almost wished i wa dead then all of a sudden i got in this big mess the first thing when i got in the elevator the elevator guy said to me innarested in having a good time fella or is it too late for you how do you mean i said i didn t know what he wa driving at or anything innarested in a little tail t night me i said which wa a very dumb answer but it s quite embarrassing when somebody come right up and asks you a question like that how old are you chief the elevator guy said why i said twenty two uh huh well how bout it y innarested five buck a throw fifteen buck the whole night he looked at his wrist watch till noon five buck a throw fifteen buck till noon okay i said it wa against my principle and all but i wa feeling so depressed i didn t even think that s the whole trouble when you re feeling very depressed you can t even think okay what a throw or till noon i got ta know just a throw okay what room ya in i looked at the red thing with my number on it on my key twelve twenty two i said i wa already sort of sorry i d let the thing start rolling but it wa too late now okay i ll send a girl up in about fifteen minute he opened the door and i got out hey is she good looking i asked him i don t want any old bag no old bag don t worry about it chief who do i pay her he said let s go chief he shut the door practically right in my face i went to my room and put some water on my hair but you can t really comb a crew cut or anything then i tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarette and the scotch and soda i drank at ernie s all you do is hold your hand under your mouth and blow your breath up toward the old nostril it didn t seem to stink much but i brushed my teeth anyway then i put on another clean shirt i knew i didn t have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything but it sort of gave me something to do i wa a little nervous i wa starting to feel pretty sexy and all but i wa a little nervous anyway if you want to know the truth i m a virgin i really am i ve had quite a few opportunity to lose my virginity and all but i ve never got around to it yet something always happens for instance if you re at a girl s house her parent always come home at the wrong time or you re afraid they will or if you re in the back seat of somebody s car there s always somebody s date in the front seat some girl i mean that always want to know what s going on all over the whole goddam car i mean some girl in front keep turning around to see what the hell s going on anyway something always happens i came quite close to doing it a couple of time though one time in particular i remember something went wrong though i don t even remember what any more the thing is most of the time when you re coming pretty close to doing it with a girl a girl that isn t a prostitute or anything i mean she keep telling you to stop the trouble with me is i stop most guy don t i can t help it you never know whether they really want you to stop or whether they re just scared a hell or whether they re just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it the blame ll be on you not them anyway i keep stopping the trouble is i get to feeling sorry for them i mean most girl are so dumb and all after you neck them for a while you can really watch them losing their brain you take a girl when she really get passionate she just hasn t any brain i don t know they tell me to stop so i stop i always wish i hadn t after i take them home but i keep doing it anyway anyway while i wa putting on another clean shirt i sort of figured this wa my big chance in a way i figured if she wa a prostitute and all i could get in some practice on her in case i ever get married or anything i worry about that stuff sometimes i read this book once at the whooton school that had this very sophisticated suave sexy guy in it monsieur blanchard wa his name i can still remember it wa a lousy book but this blanchard guy wa pretty good he had this big ch teau and all on the riviera in europe and all he did in his spare time wa beat woman off with a club he wa a real rake and all but he knocked woman out he said in this one part that a woman s body is like a violin and all and that it take a terrific musician to play it right it wa a very corny book i realize that but i couldn t get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway in a way that s why i sort of wanted to get some practice in in case i ever get married caulfield and his magic violin boy it s corny i realize but it isn t too corny i wouldn t mind being pretty good at that stuff half the time if you really want to know the truth when i m horsing around with a girl i have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what i m looking for for god s sake if you know what i mean take this girl that i just missed having sexual intercourse with that i told you about it took me about an hour to just get her goddam brassiere off by the time i did get it off she wa about ready to spit in my eye anyway i kept walking around the room waiting for this prostitute to show up i kept hoping she d be good looking i didn t care too much though i sort of just wanted to get it over with finally somebody knocked on the door and when i went to open it i had my suitcase right in the way and i fell over it and damn near broke my knee i always pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something when i opened the door this prostitute wa standing there she had a polo coat on and no hat she wa sort of a blonde but you could tell she dyed her hair she wasn t any old bag though how do you do i said suave a hell boy you the guy maurice said she asked me she didn t seem too goddam friendly is he the elevator boy yeah she said yes i am come in won t you i said i wa getting more and more nonchalant a it went along i really wa she came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed she had on a green dress underneath then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down she crossed her leg and started jiggling this one foot up and down she wa very nervous for a prostitute she really wa i think it wa because she wa young a hell she wa around my age i sat down in the big chair next to her and offered her a cigarette i don t smoke she said she had a tiny little wheeny whiny voice you could hardly hear her she never said thank you either when you offered her something she just didn t know any better allow me to introduce myself my name is jim steele i said ya got a watch on ya she said she didn t care what the hell my name wa naturally hey how old are you anyways me twenty two like fun you are it wa a funny thing to say it sounded like a real kid you d think a prostitute and all would say like hell you are or cut the crap instead of like fun you are how old are you i asked her old enough to know better she said she wa really witty ya got a watch on ya she asked me again and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head i certainly felt peculiar when she did that i mean she did it so sudden and all i know you re supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody get up and pull their dress over their head but i didn t sexy wa about the last thing i wa feeling i felt much more depressed than sexy ya got a watch on ya hey no no i don t i said boy wa i feeling peculiar what s your name i asked her all she had on wa this pink slip it wa really quite embarrassing it really wa sunny she said let s go hey don t you feel like talking for a while i asked her it wa a childish thing to say but i wa feeling so damn peculiar are you in a very big hurry she looked at me like i wa a madman what the heck ya wan na talk about she said i don t know nothing special i just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a while she sat down in the chair next to the desk again she didn t like it though you could tell she started jiggling her foot again boy she wa a nervous girl would you care for a cigarette now i said i forgot she didn t smoke i don t smoke listen if you re gon na talk do it i got thing to do i couldn t think of anything to talk about though i thought of asking her how she got to be a prostitute and all but i wa scared to ask her she probably wouldn t ve told me anyway you don t come from new york do you i said finally that s all i could think of hollywood she said then she got up and went over to where she d put her dress down on the bed ya got a hanger i don t want to get my dress all wrinkly it s brand clean sure i said right away i wa only too glad to get up and do something i took her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her it wa funny it made me feel sort of sad when i hung it up i thought of her going in a store and buying it and nobody in the store knowing she wa a prostitute and all the salesman probably just thought she wa a regular girl when she bought it it made me feel sad a hell i don t know why exactly i sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going she wa a lousy conversationalist do you work every night i asked her it sounded sort of awful after i d said it yeah she wa walking all around the room she picked up the menu off the desk and read it what do you do during the day she sort of shrugged her shoulder she wa pretty skinny sleep go to the show she put down the menu and looked at me let s go hey i haven t got all look i said i don t feel very much like myself tonight i ve had a rough night honest to god i ll pay you and all but do you mind very much if we don t do it do you mind very much the trouble wa i just didn t want to do it i felt more depressed than sexy if you want to know the truth she wa depressing her green dress hanging in the closet and all and besides i don t think i could ever do it with somebody that sits in a stupid movie all day long i really don t think i could she came over to me with this funny look on her face like a if she didn t believe me what sa matter she said nothing s the matter boy wa i getting nervous the thing is i had an operation very recently yeah where on my wuddayacallit my clavichord yeah where the hell s that the clavichord i said well actually it s in the spinal canal i mean it s quite a way down in the spinal canal yeah she said that s tough then she sat down on my goddam lap you re cute she made me so nervous i just kept on lying my head off i m still recuperating i told her you look like a guy in the movie you know whosis you know who i mean what the heck s his name i don t know i said she wouldn t get off my goddam lap sure you know he wa in that pitcher with mel vine douglas the one that wa mel vine douglas s kid brother that fall off this boat you know who i mean no i don t i go to the movie a seldom a i can then she started getting funny crude and all do you mind cutting it out i said i m not in the mood i just told you i just had an operation she didn t get up from my lap or anything but she gave me this terrifically dirty look listen she said i wa sleepin when that crazy maurice woke me up if you think i m i said i d pay you for coming and all i really will i have plenty of dough it s just that i m practically just recovering from a very serious what the heck did you tell that crazy maurice you wanted a girl for then if you just had a goddam operation on your goddam wuddayacallit huh i thought i d be feeling a lot better than i do i wa a little premature in my calculation no kidding i m sorry if you ll just get up a second i ll get my wallet i mean it she wa sore a hell but she got up off my goddam lap so that i could go over and get my wallet off the chiffonier i took out a five dollar bill and handed it to her thanks a lot i told her thanks a million this is a five it cost ten she wa getting funny you could tell i wa afraid something like that would happen i really wa maurice said five i told her he said fifteen till noon and only five for a throw ten for a throw he said five i m sorry i really am but that s all i m gon na shell out she sort of shrugged her shoulder the way she did before and then she said very cold do you mind getting me my frock or would it be too much trouble she wa a pretty spooky kid even with that little bitty voice she had she could sort of scare you a little bit if she d been a big old prostitute with a lot of makeup on her face and all she wouldn t have been half a spooky i went and got her dress for her she put it on and all and then she picked up her polo coat off the bed so long crumb bum she said so long i said i didn t thank her or anything i m glad i didn t after old sunny wa gone i sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of cigarette it wa getting daylight outside boy i felt miserable i felt so depressed you can t imagine what i did i started talking sort of out loud to allie i do that sometimes when i get very depressed i keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in front of bobby fallon s house bobby fallon used to live quite near u in maine this is year ago anyway what happened wa one day bobby and i were going over to lake sedebego on our bike we were going to take our lunch and all and our bb gun we were kid and all and we thought we could shoot something with our bb gun anyway allie heard u talking about it and he wanted to go and i wouldn t let him i told him he wa a child so once in a while now when i get very depressed i keep saying to him okay go home and get your bike and meet me in front of bobby s house hurry up it wasn t that i didn t use to take him with me when i went somewhere i did but that one day i didn t he didn t get sore about it he never got sore about anything but i keep thinking about it anyway when i get very depressed finally though i got undressed and got in bed i felt like praying or something when i wa in bed but i couldn t do it i can t always pray when i feel like it in the first place i m sort of an atheist i like jesus and all but i don t care too much for most of the other stuff in the bible take the disciple for instance they annoy the hell out of me if you want to know the truth they were all right after jesus wa dead and all but while he wa alive they were about a much use to him a a hole in the head all they did wa keep letting him down i like almost anybody in the bible better than the disciple if you want to know the truth the guy i like best in the bible next to jesus wa that lunatic and all that lived in the tomb and kept cutting himself with stone i like him ten time a much a the disciple that poor bastard i used to get in quite a few argument about it when i wa at whooton school with this boy that lived down the corridor arthur child old child wa a quaker and all and he read the bible all the time he wa a very nice kid and i liked him but i could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in the bible especially the disciple he kept telling me if i didn t like the disciple then i didn t like jesus and all he said that because jesus picked the disciple you were supposed to like them i said i knew he picked them but that he picked them at random i said he didn t have time to go around analyzing everybody i said i wasn t blaming jesus or anything it wasn t his fault that he didn t have any time i remember i asked old child if he thought juda the one that betrayed jesus and all went to hell after he committed suicide child said certainly that s exactly where i disagreed with him i said i d bet a thousand buck that jesus never sent old juda to hell i still would too if i had a thousand buck i think any one of the disciple would ve sent him to hell and all and fast too but i ll bet anything jesus didn t do it old child said the trouble with me wa that i didn t go to church or anything he wa right about that in a way i don t in the first place my parent are different religion and all the child in our family are atheist if you want to know the truth i can t even stand minister the one they ve had at every school i ve gone to they all have these holy joe voice when they start giving their sermon god i hate that i don t see why the hell they can t talk in their natural voice they sound so phony when they talk anyway when i wa in bed i couldn t pray worth a damn every time i got started i kept picturing old sunny calling me a crumb bum finally i sat up in bed and smoked another cigarette it tasted lousy i must ve smoked around two pack since i left pencey all of a sudden while i wa laying there smoking somebody knocked on the door i kept hoping it wasn t

and ask for a dime for coffee you ll have snot all over your dirty filthy overcoat and you ll be then he smacked me i didn t even try to get out of the way or duck or anything all i felt wa this terrific punch in my stomach i wasn t knocked out or anything though because i remember looking up from the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it then i stayed on the floor a fairly long time sort of the way i did with stradlater only this time i thought i wa dying i really did i thought i wa drowning or something the trouble wa i could hardly breathe when i did finally get up i had to walk to the bathroom all doubled up and holding onto my stomach and all but i m crazy i swear to god i am about halfway to the bathroom i sort of started pretending i had a bullet in my gut old maurice had plugged me now i wa on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerve and help me really go into action i pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom dressed and all with my automatic in my pocket and staggering around a little bit then i d walk downstairs instead of using the elevator i d hold onto the banister and all with this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time what i d do i d walk down a few floor holding onto my gut blood leaking all over the place and then i d ring the elevator bell a soon a old maurice opened the door he d see me with the automatic in my hand and he d start screaming at me in this very high pitched yellow belly voice to leave him alone but i d plug him anyway six shot right through his fat hairy belly then i d throw my automatic down the elevator shaft after i d wiped off all the finger print and all then i d crawl back to my room and call up jane and have her come over and bandage up my gut i pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke while i wa bleeding and all the goddam movie they can ruin you i m not kidding i stayed in the bathroom for about an hour taking a bath and all then i got back in bed it took me quite a while to get to sleep i wasn t even tired but finally i did what i really felt like though wa committing suicide i felt like jumping out the window i probably would ve done it too if i d been sure somebody d cover me up a soon a i landed i didn t want a bunch of stupid rubberneck looking at me when i wa all gory i didn t sleep too long because i think it wa only around ten o clock when i woke up i felt pretty hungry a soon a i had a cigarette the last time i d eaten wa those two hamburger i had with brossard and ackley when we went in to agerstown to the movie that wa a long time ago it seemed like fifty year ago the phone wa right next to me and i started to call down and have them send up some breakfast but i wa sort of afraid they might send it up with old maurice if you think i wa dying to see him again you re crazy so i just laid around in bed for a while and smoked another cigarette i thought of giving old jane a buzz to see if she wa home yet and all but i wasn t in the mood what i did do i gave old sally hayes a buzz she went to mary a woodruff and i knew she wa home because i d had this letter from her a couple of week ago i wasn t too crazy about her but i d known her for year i used to think she wa quite intelligent in my stupidity the reason i did wa because she knew quite a lot about the theater and play and literature and all that stuff if somebody know quite a lot about those thing it take you quite a while to find out whether they re really stupid or not it took me year to find it out in old sally s case i think i d have found it out a lot sooner if we hadn t necked so damn much my big trouble is i always sort of think whoever i m necking is a pretty intelligent person it hasn t got a goddam thing to do with it but i keep thinking it anyway anyway i gave her a buzz first the maid answered then her father then she got on sally i said yes who is this she said she wa quite a little phony i d already told her father who it wa holden caulfield how are ya holden i m fine how are you swell listen how are ya anyway i mean how s school fine she said i mean you know swell well listen i wa wondering if you were busy today it s sunday but there s always one or two matinee going on sunday benefit and that stuff would you care to go i d love to grand grand if there s one word i hate it s grand it s so phony for a second i wa tempted to tell her to forget about the matinee but we chewed the fat for a while that is she chewed it you couldn t get a word in edgewise first she told me about some harvard guy it probably wa a freshman but she didn t say naturally that wa rushing hell out of her calling her up night and day night and day that killed me then she told me about some other guy some west point cadet that wa cutting his throat over her too big deal i told her to meet me under the clock at the biltmore at two o clock and not to be late because the show probably started at two thirty she wa always late then i hung up she gave me a pain in the as but she wa very good looking after i made the date with old sally i got out of bed and got dressed and packed my bag i took a look out the window before i left the room though to see how all the pervert were doing but they all had their shade down they were the heighth of modesty in the morning then i went down in the elevator and checked out i didn t see old maurice around anywhere i didn t break my neck looking for him naturally the bastard i got a cab outside the hotel but i didn t have the faintest damn idea where i wa going i had no place to go it wa only sunday and i couldn t go home till wednesday or tuesday the soonest and i certainly didn t feel like going to another hotel and getting my brain beat out so what i did i told the driver to take me to grand central station it wa right near the biltmore where i wa meeting sally later and i figured what i d do i d check my bag in one of those strong box that they give you a key to then get some breakfast i wa sort of hungry while i wa in the cab i took out my wallet and sort of counted my money i don t remember exactly what i had left but it wa no fortune or anything i d spent a king s ransom in about two lousy week i really had i m a goddam spendthrift at heart what i don t spend i lose half the time i sort of even forget to pick up my change at restaurant and night club and all it drive my parent crazy you can t blame them my father s quite wealthy though i don t know how much he make he s never discussed that stuff with me but i imagine quite a lot he s a corporation lawyer those boy really haul it in another reason i know he s quite well off he s always investing money in show on broadway they always flop though and it drive my mother crazy when he doe it she hasn t felt too healthy since my brother allie died she s very nervous that s another reason why i hated like hell for her to know i got the ax again after i put my bag in one of those strong box at the station i went into this little sandwich bar and bad breakfast i had quite a large breakfast for me orange juice bacon and egg toast and coffee usually i just drink some orange juice i m a very light eater i really am that s why i m so damn skinny i wa supposed to be on this diet where you eat a lot of starch and crap to gain weight and all but i didn t ever do it when i m out somewhere i generally just eat a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted milk it isn t much but you get quite a lot of vitamin in the malted milk h v caulfield holden vitamin caulfield while i wa eating my egg these two nun with suitcase and all i guessed they were moving to another convent or something and were waiting for a train came in and sat down next to me at the counter they didn t seem to know what the hell to do with their suitcase so i gave them a hand they were these very inexpensive looking suitcase the one that aren t genuine leather or anything it isn t important i know but i hate it when somebody ha cheap suitcase it sound terrible to say it but i can even get to hate somebody just looking at them if they have cheap suitcase with them something happened once for a while when i wa at elkton hill i roomed with this boy dick slagle that had these very inexpensive suitcase he used to keep them under the bed instead of on the rack so that nobody d see them standing next to mine it depressed holy hell out of me and i kept wanting to throw mine out or something or even trade with him mine came from mark cross and they were genuine cowhide and all that crap and i guess they cost quite a pretty penny but it wa a funny thing here s what happened what i did i finally put my suitcase under my bed instead of on the rack so that old slagle wouldn t get a goddam inferiority complex about it but here s what he did the day after i put mine under my bed he took them out and put them back on the rack the reason he did it it took me a while to find out wa because he wanted people to think my bag were his he really did he wa a very funny guy that way he wa always saying snotty thing about them my suitcase for instance he kept saying they were too new and bourgeois that wa his favorite goddam word he read it somewhere or heard it somewhere everything i had wa bourgeois a hell even my fountain pen wa bourgeois he borrowed it off me all the time but it wa bourgeois anyway we only roomed together about two month then we both asked to be moved and the funny thing wa i sort of missed him after we moved because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes i wouldn t be surprised if he missed me too at first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois and i didn t give a damn it wa sort of funny in fact then after a while you could tell he wasn t kidding any more the thing is it s really hard to be roommate with people if your suitcase are much better than theirs if yours are really good one and theirs aren t you think if they re intelligent and all the other person and have a good sense of humor that they don t give a damn whose suitcase are better but they do they really do it s one of the reason why i roomed with a stupid bastard like stradlater at least his suitcase were a good a mine anyway these two nun were sitting next to me and we sort of struck up a conversation the one right next to me had one of those straw basket that you see nun and salvation army babe collecting dough with around christmas time you see them standing on corner especially on fifth avenue in front of the big department store and all anyway the one next to me dropped hers on the floor and i reached down and picked it up for her i asked her if she wa out collecting money for charity and all she said no she said she couldn t get it in her suitcase when she wa packing it and she wa just carrying it she had a pretty nice smile when she looked at you she had a big nose and she had on those glass with sort of iron rim that aren t too attractive but she had a helluva kind face i thought if you were taking up a collection i told her i could make a small contribution you could keep the money for when you do take up a collection oh how very kind of you she said and the other one her friend looked over at me the other one wa reading a little black book while she drank her coffee it looked like a bible but it wa too skinny it wa a bible type book though all the two of them were eating for breakfast wa toast and coffee that depressed me i hate it if i m eating bacon and egg or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee they let me give them ten buck a a contribution they kept asking me if i wa sure i could afford it and all i told them i had quite a bit of money with me but they didn t seem to believe me they took it though finally the both of them kept thanking me so much it wa embarrassing i swung the conversation around to general topic and asked them where they were going they said they were schoolteacher and that they d just come from chicago and that they were going to start teaching at some convent on th street or th street or one of those street way the hell uptown the one next to me with the iron glass said she taught english and her friend taught history and american government then i started wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next to me that taught english thought about being a nun and all when she read certain book for english book not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them but book with lover and all in them take old eustacia vye in the return of the native by thomas hardy she wasn t too sexy or anything but even so you can t help wondering what a nun maybe think about when she read about old eustacia i didn t say anything though naturally all i said wa english wa my best subject oh really oh i m so glad the one with the glass that taught english said what have you read this year i d be very interested to know she wa really nice well most of the time we were on the anglo saxon beowulf and old grendel and lord randal my son and all those thing but we had to read outside book for extra credit once in a while i read the return of the native by thomas hardy and romeo and juliet and julius oh romeo and juliet lovely didn t you just love it she certainly didn t sound much like a nun yes i did i liked it a lot there were a few thing i didn t like about it but it wa quite moving on the whole what didn t you like about it can you remember to tell you the truth it wa sort of embarrassing in a way to be talking about romeo and juliet with her i mean that play get pretty sexy in some part and she wa a nun and all but she asked me so i discussed it with her for a while well i m not too crazy about romeo and juliet i said i mean i like them but i don t know they get pretty annoying sometimes i mean i felt much sorrier when old mercutio got killed than when romeo and juliet did the think is i never liked romeo too much after mercutio get stabbed by that other man juliet s cousin what s his name tybalt that s right tybalt i said i always forget that guy s name it wa romeo s fault i mean i liked him the best in the play old mercutio i don t know all those montagues and capulets they re all right especially juliet but mercutio he wa it s hard to explain he wa very smart and entertaining and all the thing is it drive me crazy if somebody get killed especially somebody very smart and entertaining and all and it s somebody else s fault romeo and juliet at least it wa their own fault what school do you go to she asked me she probably wanted to get off the subject of romeo and juliet i told her pencey and she d heard of it she said it wa a very good school i let it pas though then the other one the one that taught history and government said they d better be running along i took their check off them but they wouldn t let me pay it the one with the glass made me give it back to her you ve been more than generous she said you re a very sweet boy she certainly wa nice she reminded me a little bit of old ernest morrow s mother the one i met on the train when she smiled mostly we ve enjoyed talking to you so much she said i said i d enjoyed talking to them a lot too i meant it too i d have enjoyed it even more though i think if i hadn t been sort of afraid the whole time i wa talking to them that they d all of a sudden try to find out if i wa a catholic catholic are always trying to find out if you re a catholic it happens to me a lot i know partly because my last name is irish and most people of irish descent are catholic a a matter of fact my father wa a catholic once he quit though when he married my mother but catholic are always trying to find out if you re a catholic even if they don t know your last name i knew this one catholic boy louis shaney when i wa at the whooton school he wa the first boy i ever met there he and i were sitting in the first two chair outside the goddam infirmary the day school opened waiting for our physicals and we sort of struck up this conversation about tennis he wa quite interested in tennis and so wa i he told me he went to the national at forest hill every summer and i told him i did too and then we talked about certain hot shot tennis player for quite a while he knew quite a lot about tennis for a kid his age he really did then after a while right in the middle of the goddam conversation he asked me did you happen to notice where the catholic church is in town by any chance the thing wa you could tell by the way he asked me that he wa trying to find out if i wa a catholic he really wa not that he wa prejudiced or anything but he just wanted to know he wa enjoying the conversation about tennis and all but you could tell he would ve enjoyed it more if i wa a catholic and all that kind of stuff drive me crazy i m not saying it ruined our conversation or anything it didn t but it sure a hell didn t do it any good that s why i wa glad those two nun didn t ask me if i wa a catholic it wouldn t have spoiled the conversation if they had but it would ve been different probably i m not saying i blame catholic i don t i d be the same way probably if i wa a catholic it s just like those suitcase i wa telling you about in a way all i m saying is that it s no good for a nice conversation that s all i m saying when they got up to go the two nun i did something very stupid and embarrassing i wa smoking a cigarette and when i stood up to say good by to them by mistake i blew some smoke in their face i didn t mean to but i did it i apologized like a madman and they were very polite and nice about it but it wa very embarrassing anyway after they left i started getting sorry that i d only given them ten buck for their collection but the thing wa i d made that date to go to a matinee with old sally hayes and i needed to keep some dough for the ticket and stuff i wa sorry anyway though goddam money it always end up making you blue a hell after i had my breakfast it wa only around noon and i wasn t meeting old sally till two o clock so i started taking this long walk i couldn t stop thinking about those two nun i kept thinking about that beatup old straw basket they went around collecting money with when they weren t teaching school i kept trying to picture my mother or somebody or my aunt or sally hayes s crazy mother standing outside some department store and collecting dough for poor people in a beat up old straw basket it wa hard to picture not so much my mother but those other two my aunt s pretty charitable she doe a lot of red cross work and all but she s very well dressed and all and when she doe anything charitable she s always very well dressed and ha lipstick on and all that crap i couldn t picture her doing anything for charity if she had to wear black clothes and no lipstick while she wa doing it and old sally hayes s mother jesus christ the only way she could go around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed her as for her when they made a contribution if they just dropped their dough in her basket then walked away without saying anything to her ignoring her and all she d quit in about an hour she d get bored she d hand in her basket and then go someplace swanky for lunch that s what i liked about those nun you could tell for one thing that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch it made me so damn sad when i thought about it their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything i knew it wasn t too important but it made me sad anyway i started walking over toward broadway just for the hell of it because i hadn t been over there in year besides i wanted to find a record store that wa open on sunday there wa this record i wanted to get for phoebe called little shirley bean it wa a very hard record to get it wa about a little kid that wouldn t go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she wa ashamed to i heard it at pencey a boy that lived on the next floor had it and i tried to buy it off him because i knew it would knock old phoebe out but he wouldn t sell it it wa a very old terrific record that this colored girl singer estelle fletcher made about twenty year ago she sings it very dixieland and whorehouse and it doesn t sound at all mushy if a white girl wa singing it she d make it sound cute a hell but old estelle fletcher knew what the hell she wa doing and it wa one of the best record i ever heard i figured i d buy it in some store that wa open on sunday and then i d take it up to the park with me it wa sunday and phoebe go rollerskating in the park on sunday quite frequently i knew where she hung out mostly it wasn t a cold a it wa the day before but the sun still wasn t out and it wasn t too nice for walking but there wa one nice thing this family that you could tell just came out of some church were walking right in front of me a father a mother and a little kid about six year old they looked sort of poor the father had on one of those pearl gray hat that poor guy wear a lot when they want to look sharp he and his wife were just walking along talking not paying any attention to their kid the kid wa swell he wa walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk but right next to the curb he wa making out like he wa walking a very straight line the way kid do and the whole time he kept singing and humming i got up closer so i could hear what he wa singing he wa singing that song if a body catch a body coming through the rye he had a pretty little voice too he wa just singing for the hell of it you could tell the car zoomed by brake screeched all over the place his parent paid no attention to him and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing if a body catch a body coming through the rye it made me feel better it made me feel not so depressed any more broadway wa mobbed and messy it wa sunday and only about twelve o clock but it wa mobbed anyway everybody wa on their way to the movie the paramount or the astor or the strand or the capitol or one of those crazy place everybody wa all dressed up because it wa sunday and that made it worse but the worst part wa that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movie i couldn t stand looking at them i can understand somebody going to the movie because there s nothing else to do but when somebody really want to go and even walk fast so a to get there quicker then it depresses hell out of me especially if i see million of people standing in one of those long terrible line all the way down the block waiting with this terrific patience for seat and all boy i couldn t get off that goddam broadway fast enough i wa lucky the first record store i went into had a copy of little shirley bean they charged me five buck for it because it wa so hard to get but i didn t care boy it made me so happy all of a sudden i could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old phoebe wa around so that i could give it to her when i came out of the record store i passed this drugstore and i went in i figured maybe i d give old jane a buzz and see if she wa home for vacation yet so i went in a phone booth and called her up the only trouble wa her mother answered the phone so i had to hang up i didn t feel like getting involved in a long conversation and all with her i m not crazy about talking to girl mother on the phone anyway i should ve at least asked her if jane wa home yet though it wouldn t have killed me but i didn t feel like it you really have to be in the mood for that stuff i still had to get those damn theater ticket so i bought a paper and looked up to see what show were playing on account of it wa sunday there were only about three show playing so what i did wa i went over and bought two orchestra seat for i know my love it wa a benefit performance or something i didn t much want to see it but i knew old sally the queen of the phony would start drooling all over the place when i told her i had ticket for that because the lunt were in it and all she liked show that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all with the lunt and all i don t i don t like any show very much if you want to know the truth they re not a bad a movie but they re certainly nothing to rave about in the first place i hate actor they never act like people they just think they do some of the good one do in a very slight way but not in a way that s fun to watch and if any actor s really good you can always tell he know he s good and that spoil it you take sir laurence olivier for example i saw him in hamlet d b took phoebe and i to see it last year he treated u to lunch first and then he took u he d already seen it and the way he talked about it at lunch i wa anxious a hell to see it too but i didn t enjoy it much i just don t see what s so marvelous about sir laurence olivier that s all he ha a terrific voice and he s a helluva handsome guy and he s very nice to watch when he s walking or dueling or something but he wasn t at all the way d b said hamlet wa he wa too much like a goddam general instead of a sad screwed up type guy the best part in the whole picture wa when old ophelia s brother the one that get in the duel with hamlet at the very end wa going away and his father wa giving him a lot of advice while the father kept giving him a lot of advice old ophelia wa sort of horsing around with her brother taking his dagger out of the holster and teasing him and all while he wa trying to look interested in the bull his father wa shooting that wa nice i got a big bang out of that but you don t see that kind of stuff much the only thing old phoebe liked wa when hamlet patted this dog on the head she thought that wa funny and nice and it wa what i ll have to do is i ll have to read that play the trouble with me is i always have to read that stuff by myself if an actor act it out i hardly listen i keep worrying about whether he s going to do something phony every minute after i got the ticket to the lunt show i took a cab up to the park i should ve taken a subway or something because i wa getting slightly low on dough but i wanted to get off that damn broadway a fast a i could it wa lousy in the park it wasn t too cold but the sun still wasn t out and there didn t look like there wa anything in the park except dog crap and glob of spit and cigar butt from old men and the bench all looked like they d be wet if you sat down on them it made you depressed and every once in a while for no reason you got goose flesh while you walked it didn t seem at all like christmas wa coming soon it didn t seem like anything wa coming but i kept walking over to the mall anyway because that s where phoebe usually go when she s in the park she like to skate near the bandstand it s funny that s the same place i used to like to skate when i wa a kid when i got there though i didn t see her around anywhere there were a few kid around skating and all and two boy were playing fly up with a soft ball but no phoebe i saw one kid about her age though sitting on a bench all by herself tightening her skate i thought maybe she might know phoebe and could tell me where she wa or something so i went over and sat down next to her and asked her do you know phoebe caulfield by any chance who she said all she had on wa jean and about twenty sweater you could tell her mother made them for her because they were lumpy a hell phoebe caulfield she life on seventy first street she s in the fourth grade over at you know phoebe yeah i m her brother you know where she is she s in miss callon s class isn t she the kid said i don t know yes i think she is she s prob ly in the museum then we went last saturday the kid said which museum i asked her she shrugged her shoulder sort of i don t know she said the museum i know but the one where the picture are or the one where the indian are the one where the indian thanks a lot i said i got up and started to go but then i suddenly remembered it wa sunday this is sunday i told the kid she looked up at me oh then she isn t she wa having a helluva time tightening her skate she didn t have any glove on or anything and her hand were all red and cold i gave her a hand with it boy i hadn t had a skate key in my hand for year it didn t feel funny though you could put a skate key in my hand fifty year from now in pitch dark and i d still know what it is she thanked me and all when i had it tightened for her she wa a very nice polite little kid god i love it when a kid s nice and polite when you tighten their skate for them or something most kid are they really are i asked her if she d care to have a hot chocolate or something with me but she said no thank you she said she had to meet her friend kid always have to meet their friend that kill me even though it wa sunday and phoebe wouldn t be there with her class or anything and even though it wa so damp and lousy out i walked all the way through the park over to the museum of natural history i knew that wa the museum the kid with the skate key meant i knew that whole museum routine like a book phoebe went to the same school i went to when i wa a kid and we used to go there all the time we had this teacher miss aigletinger that took u there damn near every saturday sometimes we looked at the animal and sometimes we looked at the stuff the indian had made in ancient time pottery and straw basket and all stuff like that i get very happy when i think about it even now i remember after we looked at all the indian stuff usually we went to see some movie in this big auditorium columbus they were always showing columbus discovering america having one helluva time getting old ferdinand and isabella to lend him the dough to buy ship with and then the sailor mutinying on him and all nobody gave too much of a damn about old columbus but you always had a lot of candy and gum and stuff with you and the inside of that auditorium had such a nice smell it always smelled like it wa raining outside even if it wasn t and you were in the only nice dry cosy place in the world i loved that damn museum i remember you had to go through the indian room to get to the auditorium it wa a long long room and you were only supposed to whisper the teacher would go first then the class you d be two row of kid and you d have a partner most of the time my partner wa this girl named gertrude levine she always wanted to hold your hand and her hand wa always sticky or sweaty or something the floor wa all stone and if you had some marble in your hand and you dropped them they bounced like madman all over the floor and made a helluva racket and the teacher would hold up the class and go back and see what the hell wa going on she never got sore though miss aigletinger then you d pas by this long long indian war canoe about a long a three goddam cadillacs in a row with about twenty indian in it some of them paddling some of them just standing around looking tough and they all had war paint all over their face there wa one very spooky guy in the back of the canoe with a mask on he wa the witch doctor he gave me the creep but i liked him anyway another thing if you touched one of the paddle or anything while you were passing one of the guard would say to you don t touch anything child but he always said it in a nice voice not like a goddam cop or anything then you d pas by this big glass case with indian inside it rubbing stick together to make a fire and a squaw weaving a blanket the squaw that wa weaving the blanket wa sort of bending over and you could see her bosom and all we all used to sneak a good look at it even the girl because they were only little kid and they didn t have any more bosom than we did then just before you went inside the auditorium right near the door you passed this eskimo he wa sitting over a hole in this icy lake and he wa fishing through it he had about two fish right next to the hole that he d already caught boy that museum wa full of glass case there were even more upstairs with deer inside them drinking at water hole and bird flying south for the winter the bird nearest you were all stuffed and hung up on wire and the one in back were just painted on the wall but they all looked like they were really flying south and if you bent your head down and sort of looked at them upside down they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south the best thing though in that museum wa that everything always stayed right where it wa nobody d move you could go there a hundred thousand time and that eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish the bird would still be on their way south the deer would still be drinking out of that water hole with their pretty antler and their pretty skinny leg and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket nobody d be different the only thing that would be different would be you not that you d be so much older or anything it wouldn t be that exactly you d just be different that s all you d have an overcoat on this time or the kid that wa your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and you d have a new partner or you d have a substitute taking the class instead of miss aigletinger or you d heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom or you d just passed by one of those puddle in the street with gasoline rainbow in them i mean you d be different in some way i can t explain what i mean and even if i could i m not sure i d feel like it i took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while i walked and put it on i knew i wouldn t meet anybody that knew me and it wa pretty damp out i kept walking and walking and i kept thinking about old phoebe going to that museum on saturday the way i used to i thought how she d see the same stuff i used to see and how she d be different every time she saw it it didn t exactly depress me to think about it but it didn t make me feel gay a hell either certain thing they should stay the way they are you ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass case and just leave them alone i know that s impossible but it s too bad anyway anyway i kept thinking about all that while i walked i passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kid on a seesaw one of them wa sort of fat and i put my hand on the skinny kid s end to sort of even up the weight but you could tell they didn t want me around so i let them alone then a funny thing happened when i got to the museum all of a sudden i wouldn t have gone inside for a million buck it just didn t appeal to me and here i d walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all if phoebe d been there i probably would have but she wasn t so all i did in front of the museum wa get a cab and go down to the biltmore i didn t feel much like going i d made that damn date with sally though i wa way early when i got there so i just sat down on one of those leather couch right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girl a lot of school were home for vacation already and there were about a million girl sitting and standing around waiting for their date to show up girl with their leg crossed girl with their leg not crossed girl with terrific leg girl with lousy leg girl that looked like swell girl girl that looked like they d be bitch if you knew them it wa really nice sightseeing if you know what i mean in a way it wa sort of depressing too because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them when they got out of school and college i mean you figured most of them would probably marry dopey guy guy that always talk about how many mile they get to a gallon in their goddam car guy that get sore and childish a hell if you beat them at golf or even just some stupid game like ping pong guy that are very mean guy that never read book guy that are very boring but i have to be careful about that i mean about calling certain guy bore i don t understand boring guy i really don t when i wa at elkton hill i roomed for about two month with this boy harris mackim he wa very intelligent and all but he wa one of the biggest bore i ever met he had one of these very raspy voice and he never stopped talking practically he never stopped talking and what wa awful wa he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place but he could do one thing the sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody i ever heard he d be making his bed or hanging up stuff in the closet he wa always hanging up stuff in the closet it drove me crazy and he d be whistling while he did it if he wasn t talking in this raspy voice he could even whistle classical stuff but most of the time he just whistled jazz he could take something very jazzy like tin roof blue and whistle it so nice and easy right while he wa hanging stuff up in the closet that it could kill you naturally i never told him i thought he wa a terrific whistler i mean you don t just go up to somebody and say you re a terrific whistler but i roomed with him for about two whole month even though he bored me till i wa half crazy just because he wa such a terrific whistler the best i ever heard so i don t know about bore maybe you shouldn t feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them they don t hurt anybody most of them and maybe they re secretly all terrific whistler or something who the hell know not me finally old sally started coming up the stair and i started down to meet her she looked terrific she really did she had on this black coat and sort of a black beret she hardly ever wore a hat but that beret looked nice the funny part is i felt like marrying her the minute i saw her i m crazy i didn t even like her much and yet all of a sudden i felt like i wa in love with her and wanted to marry her i swear to god i m crazy i admit it holden she said it s marvelous to see you it s been age she had one of these very loud embarrassing voice when you met her somewhere she got away with it because she wa so damn good looking but it always gave me a pain in the as swell to see you i said i meant it too how are ya anyway absolutely marvelous am i late i told her no but she wa around ten minute late a a matter of fact i didn t give a damn though all that crap they have in cartoon in the saturday evening post and all showing guy on street corner looking sore a hell because their date are late that s bunk if a girl look swell when she meet you who give a damn if she s late nobody we better hurry i said the show start at two forty we started going down the stair to where the taxi are what are we going to see she said i don t know the lunt it s all i could get ticket for the lunt oh marvelous i told you she d go mad when she heard it wa for the lunt we horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater at first she didn t want to because she had her lipstick on and all but i wa being seductive a hell and she didn t have any alternative twice when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic i damn near fell off the seat those damn driver never even look where they re going i swear they don t then just to show you how crazy i am when we were coming out of this big clinch i told her i loved her and all it wa a lie of course but the thing is i meant it when i said it i m crazy i swear to god i am oh darling i love you too she said then right in the same damn breath she said promise me you ll let your hair grow crew cut are getting corny and your hair s so lovely lovely my as the show wasn t a bad a some i ve seen it wa on the crappy side though it wa about five hundred thousand year in the life of this one old couple it start out when they re young and all and the girl s parent don t want her to marry the boy but she marries him anyway then they keep getting older and older the husband go to war and the wife ha this brother that s a drunkard i couldn t get very interested i mean i didn t care too much when anybody in the family died or anything they were all just a bunch of actor the husband and wife were a pretty nice old couple very witty and all but i couldn t get too interested in them for one thing they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play every time you saw them some butler wa shoving some tea in front of them or the wife wa pouring it for somebody and everybody kept coming in and going out all the time you got dizzy watching people sit down and stand up alfred lunt and lynn fontanne were the old couple and they were very good but i didn t like them much they were different though i ll say that they didn t act like people and they didn t act like actor it s hard to explain they acted more like they knew they were celebrity and all i mean they were good but they were too good when one of them got finished making a speech the other one said something very fast right after it it wa supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all the trouble wa it wa too much like people talking and interrupting each other they acted a little bit the way old ernie down in the village play the piano if you do something too good then after a while if you don t watch it you start showing off and then you re not a good any more but anyway they were the only one in the show the lunt i mean that looked like they had any real brain i have to admit it at the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerk for a cigarette what a deal that wa you never saw so many phony in all your life everybody smoking their ear off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they were some dopey movie actor wa standing near u having a cigarette i don t know his name but he always play the part of a guy in a war movie that get yellow before it s time to go over the top he wa with some gorgeous blonde and the two of them were trying to be very blas and all like a if he didn t even know people were looking at him modest a hell i got a big bang out of it old sally didn t talk much except to rave about the lunt because she wa busy rubbering and being charming then all of a sudden she saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby some guy in one of those very dark gray flannel suit and one of those checkered vest strictly ivy league big deal he wa standing next to the wall smoking himself to death and looking bored a hell old sally kept saying i know that boy from somewhere she always knew somebody any place you took her or thought she did she kept saying that till i got bored a hell and i said to her why don t you go on over and give him a big soul kiss if you know him he ll enjoy it she got sore when i said that finally though the jerk noticed her and came over and said hello you should ve seen the way they said hello you d have thought they hadn t seen each other in twenty year you d have thought they d taken bath in the same bathtub or something when they were little kid old buddyroos it wa nauseating the funny part wa they probably met each other just once at some phony party finally when they were all done slobbering around old sally introduced u his name wa george something i don t even remember and he went to andover big big deal you should ve seen him when old sally asked him how he liked the play he wa the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebody s question he stepped back and stepped right on the lady s foot behind him he probably broke every toe in her body he said the play itself wa no masterpiece but that the lunt of course were absolute angel angel for chrissake angel that killed me then he and old sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew it wa the phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life they both kept thinking of place a fast a they could then they d think of somebody that lived there and mention their name i wa all set to puke when it wa time to go sit down again i really wa and then when the next act wa over they continued their goddam boring conversation they kept thinking of more place and more name of people that lived there the worst part wa the jerk had one of those very phony ivy league voice one of those very tired snobby voice he sounded just like a girl he didn t hesitate to horn in on my date the bastard i even thought for a minute that he wa going to get in the goddam cab with u when the show wa over because he walked about two block with u but he had to meet a bunch of phony for cocktail he said i could see them all sitting around in some bar with their goddam checkered vest criticizing show and book and woman in those tired snobby voice they kill me those guy i sort of hated old sally by the time we got in the cab after listening to that phony andover bastard for about ten hour i wa all set to take her home and all i really wa but she said i have a marvelous idea she wa always having a marvelous idea listen she said what time do you have to be home for dinner i mean are you in a terrible hurry or anything do you have to be home any special time me no no special time i said truer word wa never spoken boy why let s go ice skating at radio city that s the kind of idea she always had ice skating at radio city you mean right now just for an hour or so don t you want to if you don t want to i didn t say i didn t want to i said sure if you want to do you mean it don t just say it if you don t mean it i mean i don t give a darn one way or the other not much she didn t you can rent those darling little skating skirt old sally said jeannette cultz did it last week that s why she wa so hot to go she wanted to see herself in one of those little skirt that just come down over their butt and all so we went and after they gave u our skate they gave sally this little blue butt twitcher of a dress to wear she really did look damn good in it though i save to admit it and don t think she didn t know it the kept walking ahead of me so that i d see how cute her little as looked it did look pretty cute too i have to admit it the funny part wa though we were the worst skater on the whole goddam rink i mean the worst and there were some lulu too old sally s ankle kept bending in till they were practically on the ice they not only looked stupid a hell but they probably hurt like hell too i know mine did mine were killing me we must ve looked gorgeous and what made it worse there were at least a couple of hundred rubberneck that didn t have anything better to do than stand around and watch everybody falling all over themselves do you want to get a table inside and have a drink or something i said to her finally that s the most marvelous idea you ve had all day the said she wa killing herself it wa brutal i really felt sorry for her we took off our goddam skate and went inside this bar where you can get drink and watch the skater in just your stocking foot a soon a we sat down old sally took off her glove and i gave her a cigarette she wasn t looking too happy the waiter came up and i ordered a coke for her she didn t drink and a scotch and soda for myself but the sonuvabitch wouldn t bring me one so i had a coke too then i sort of started lighting match i do that quite a lot when i m in a certain mood i sort of let them burn down till i can t hold them any more then i drop them in the ashtray it s a nervous habit then all of a sudden out of a clear blue sky old sally said look i have to know are you or aren t you coming over to help me trim the tree christmas eve i have to know she wa still being snotty on account of her ankle when she wa skating i wrote you i would you ve asked me that about twenty time sure i am i mean i have to know she said she started looking all around the goddam room all of a sudden i quit lighting match and sort of leaned nearer to her over the table i had quite a few topic on my mind hey sally i said what she said she wa looking at some girl on the other side of the room did you ever get fed up i said i mean did you ever get scared that everything wa going to go lousy unless you did something i mean do you like school and all that stuff it s a terrific bore i mean do you hate it i know it s a terrific bore but do you hate it is what i mean well i don t exactly hate it you always have to well i hate it boy do i hate it i said but it isn t just that it s everything i hate living in new york and all taxicab and madison avenue bus with the driver and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door and being introduced to phony guy that call the lunt angel and going up and down in elevator when you just want to go outside and guy fitting your pant all the time at brook and people always don t shout please old sally said which wa very funny because i wasn t even shouting take car i said i said it in this very quiet voice take most people they re crazy about car they worry if they get a little scratch on them and they re always talking about how many mile they get to a gallon and if they get a brand new car already they start thinking about trading it in for one that s even newer i don t even like old car i mean they don t even interest me i d rather have a goddam horse a horse is at least human for god s sake a horse you can at least i don t know what you re even talking about old sally said you jump from one you know something i said you re probably the only reason i m in new york right now or anywhere if you weren t around i d probably be someplace way the hell off in the wood or some goddam place you re the only reason i m around practically you re sweet she said but you could tell she wanted me to change the damn subject you ought to go to a boy school sometime try it sometime i said it s full of phony and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam cadillac some day and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses and all you do is talk about girl and liquor and sex all day and everybody stick together in these dirty little goddam clique the guy that are on the basketball team stick together the catholic stick together the goddam intellectual stick together the guy that play bridge stick together even the guy that belong to the goddam book of the month club stick together if you try to have a little intelligent now listen old sally said lot of boy get more out of school than that i agree i agree they do some of them but that s all i get out of it see that s my point that s exactly my goddam point i said i don t get hardly anything out of anything i m in bad shape i m in lousy shape you certainly are then all of a sudden i got this idea look i said here s my idea how would you like to get the hell out of here here s my idea i know this guy down in greenwich village that we can borrow his car for a couple of week he used to go to the same school i did and he still owes me ten buck what we could do is tomorrow morning we could drive up to massachusetts and vermont and all around there see it s beautiful a hell up there it really is i wa getting excited a hell the more i thought of it and i sort of reached over and took old sally s goddam hand what a goddam fool i wa no kidding i said i have about a hundred and eighty buck in the bank i can take it out when it open in the morning and then i could go down and get this guy s car no kidding we ll stay in these cabin camp and stuff like that till the dough run out then when the dough run out i could get a job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and later on we could get married or something i could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all honest to god we could have a terrific time wuddaya say c mon wuddaya say will you do it with me please you can t just do something like that old sally said she sounded sore a hell why not why the hell not stop screaming at me please she said which wa crap because i wasn t even screaming at her why can tcha why not because you can t that s all in the first place we re both practically child and did you ever stop to think what you d do if you didn t get a job when your money ran out we d starve to death the whole thing s so fantastic it isn t even it isn t fantastic i d get a job don t worry about that you don t have to worry about that what s the matter don t you want to go with me say so if you don t it isn t that it isn t that at all old sally said i wa beginning to hate her in a way we ll have oodles of time to do those thing all those thing i mean after you go to college and all and if we should get married and all there ll be oodles of marvelous place to go to you re just no there wouldn t be there wouldn t be oodles of place to go to at all it d be entirely different i said i wa getting depressed a hell again what she said i can t hear you one minute you scream at me and the next you i said no there wouldn t be marvelous place to go to after i went to college and all open your ear it d be entirely different we d have to go downstairs in elevator with suitcase and stuff we d have to phone up everybody and tell em good by and send em postcard from hotel and all and i d be working in some office making a lot of dough and riding to work in cab and madison avenue bus and reading newspaper and playing bridge all the time and going to the movie and seeing a lot of stupid short and coming attraction and newsreel newsreel christ almighty there s always a dumb horse race and some dame breaking a bottle over a ship and some chimpanzee riding a goddam bicycle with pant on it wouldn t be the same at all you don t see what i mean at all maybe i don t maybe you don t either old sally said we both hated each other s gut by that time you could see there wasn t any sense trying to have an intelligent conversation i wa sorry a hell i d started it c mon let s get outa here i said you give me a royal pain in the as if you want to know the truth boy did she hit the ceiling when i said that i know i shouldn t ve said it and i probably wouldn t ve ordinarily but she wa depressing the hell out of me usually i never say crude thing like that to girl boy did she hit the ceiling i apologized like a madman but she wouldn t accept my apology she wa even cry which scared me a little bit because i wa a little afraid she d go home and tell her father i called her a pain in the as her father wa one of those big silent bastard and he wasn t too crazy about me anyhow he once told old sally i wa too goddam noisy no kidding i m sorry i kept telling her you re sorry you re sorry that s very funny she said she wa still sort of cry and all of a sudden i did feel sort of sorry i d said it c mon i ll take ya home no kidding i can go home by myself thank you if you think i d let you take me home you re mad no boy ever said that to me in my entire life the whole thing wa sort of funny in a way if you thought about it and all of a sudden i did something i shouldn t have i laughed and i have one of these very loud stupid laugh i mean if i ever sat behind myself in a movie or something i d probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up it made old sally madder than ever i stuck around for a while apologizing and trying to get her to excuse me but she wouldn t she kept telling me to go away and leave her alone so finally i did it i went inside and got my shoe and stuff and left without her i shouldn t ve but i wa pretty goddam fed up by that time if you want to know the truth i don t even know why i started all that stuff with her i mean about going away somewhere to massachusetts and vermont and all i probably wouldn t ve taken her even if she d wanted to go with me she wouldn t have been anybody to go with the terrible part though is that i meant it when i asked her that s the terrible part i swear to god i m a madman when i left the skating rink i felt sort of hungry so i went in this drugstore and had a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted and then i went in a phone booth i thought maybe i might give old jane another buzz and see if she wa home yet i mean i had the whole evening free and i thought i d give her a buzz and if she wa home yet take her dancing or something somewhere i never danced with her or anything the whole time i knew her i saw her dancing once though she looked like a very good dancer it wa at this fourth of july dance at the club i didn t know her too well then and i didn t think i ought to cut in on her date she wa dating this terrible guy al pike that went to choate i didn t know him too well but he wa always hanging around the swimming pool he wore those white lastex kind of swimming trunk and he wa always going off the high dive he did the same lousy old half gainer all day long it wa the only dive he could do but he thought he wa very hot stuff all muscle and no brain anyway that s who jane dated that night i couldn t understand it i swear i couldn t after we started going around together i asked her how come she could date a showoff bastard like al pike jane said he wasn t a show off she said he had an inferiority complex she acted like she felt sorry for him or something and she wasn t just putting it on she meant it it s a funny thing about girl every time you mention some guy that s strictly a bastard very mean or very conceited and all and when you mention it to the girl she ll tell you he ha an inferiority complex maybe he ha but that still doesn t keep him from being a bastard in my opinion girl you never know what they re going to think i once got this girl roberta walsh s roommate a date with a friend of mine his name wa bob robinson and he really had an inferiority complex you could tell he wa very ashamed of his parent and all because they said he don t and she don t and stuff like that and they weren t very wealthy but he wasn t a bastard or anything he wa a very nice guy but this roberta walsh s roommate didn t like him at all she told roberta he wa too conceited and the reason she thought he wa conceited wa because he happened to mention to her that he wa captain of the debating team a little thing like that and she thought he wa conceited the trouble with girl is if they like a boy no matter how big a bastard he is they ll say he ha an inferiority complex and if they don t like him no matter how nice a guy he is or how big an inferiority complex he ha they ll say he s conceited even smart girl do it anyway i gave old jane a buzz again but her phone didn t answer so i had to hang up then i had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be available for the evening the trouble wa though my address book only ha about three people in it jane and this man mr antolini that wa my teacher at elkton hill and my father s office number i keep forgetting to put people s name in so what i did finally i gave old carl luce a buzz he graduated from the whooton school after i left he wa about three year older than i wa and i didn t like him too much but he wa one of these very intellectual guy he had the highest i q of any boy at whooton and i thought he might want to have dinner with me somewhere and have a slightly intellectual conversation he wa very enlightening sometimes so i gave him a buzz he went to columbia now but he lived on th street and all and i knew he d be home when i got him on the phone he said he couldn t make it for dinner but that he d meet me for a drink at ten o clock at the wicker bar on th i think he wa pretty surprised to hear from me i once called him a fat assed phony i had quite a bit of time to kill till ten o clock so what i did i went to the movie at radio city it wa probably the worst thing i could ve done but it wa near and i couldn t think of anything else i came in when the goddam stage show wa on the rockettes were kicking their head off the way they do when they re all in line with their arm around each other s waist the audience applauded like mad and some guy behind me kept saying to his wife you know what that is that s precision he killed me then after the rockettes a guy came out in a tuxedo and roller skate on and started skating under a bunch of little table and telling joke while he did it he wa a very good skater and all but i couldn t enjoy it much because i kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that roller skate on the stage it seemed so stupid i guess i just wasn t in the right mood then after him they had this christmas thing they have at radio city every year all these angel start coming out of the box and everywhere guy carrying crucifix and stuff all over the place and the whole bunch of them thousand of them singing come all ye faithful like mad big deal it s supposed to be religious a hell i know and very pretty and all but i can t see anything religious or pretty for god s sake about a bunch of actor carrying crucifix all over the stage when they were all finished and started going out the box again you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something i saw it with old sally hayes the year before and she kept saying how beautiful it wa the costume and all i said old jesus probably would ve puked if he could see it all those fancy costume and all sally said i wa a sacrilegious atheist i probably am the thing jesus really would ve liked would be the guy that play the kettle drum in the orchestra i ve watched that guy since i wa about eight year old my brother allie and i if we were with our parent and all we used to move our seat and go way down so we could watch him he s the best drummer i ever saw he only get a chance to bang them a couple of time during a whole piece but he never look bored when he isn t doing it then when he doe bang them he doe it so nice and sweet with this nervous expression on his face one time when we went to washington with my father allie sent him a postcard but i ll bet he never got it we weren t too sure how to address it after the christmas thing wa over the goddam picture started it wa so putrid i couldn t take my eye off it it wa about this english guy alec something that wa in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all he come out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place all over london not knowing who the hell he is he s really a duke but he doesn t know it then he meet this nice homey sincere girl getting on a bus her goddam hat blow off and he catch it and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about charles dickens he s both their favorite author and all he s carrying this copy of oliver twist and so s she i could ve puked anyway they fell in love right away on account of they re both so nut about charles dickens and all and he help her run her publishing business she s a publisher the girl only she s not doing so hot because her brother s a drunkard and he spends all their dough he s a very bitter guy the brother because he wa a doctor in the war and now he can t operate any more because his nerve are shot so he booze all the time but he s pretty witty and all anyway old alec writes a book and this girl publishes it and they both make a hatful of dough on it they re all set to get married when this other girl old marcia show up marcia wa alec s fianc e before he lost his memory and she recognizes him when he s in this store autographing book she tell old alec he s really a duke and all but he doesn t believe her and doesn t want to go with her to visit his mother and all his mother s blind a a bat but the other girl the homey one make him go she s very noble and all so he go but he still doesn t get his memory back even when his great dane jump all over him and his mother stick her finger all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he wa a kid but then one day some kid are playing cricket on the lawn and he get smacked in the head with a cricket ball then right away he get his goddam memory back and he go in and kiss his mother on the forehead and all then he start being a regular duke again and he forgets all about the homey babe that ha the publishing business i d tell you the rest of the story but i might puke if i did it isn t that i d spoil it for you or anything there isn t anything to spoil for chrissake anyway it end up with alec and the homey babe getting married and the brother that s a drunkard get his nerve back and operates on alec s mother so she can see again and then the drunken brother and old marcia go for each other it end up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their ass off because the great dane come in with a bunch of puppy everybody thought it wa a male i suppose or some goddam thing all i can say is don t see it if you don t want to puke all over yourself the part that got me wa there wa a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddam picture the phonier it got the more she cried you d have thought she did it because she wa kindhearted a hell but i wa sitting right next to her and she wasn t she had this little kid with her that wa bored a hell and had to go to the bathroom but she wouldn t take him she kept telling him to sit still and behave himself she wa about a kindhearted a a goddam wolf you take somebody that cry their goddam eye out over phony stuff in the movie and nine time out of ten they re mean bastard at heart i m not kidding after the movie wa over i started walking down to the wicker bar where i wa supposed to meet old carl luce and while i walked i sort of thought about war and all those war movie always do that to me i don t think i could stand it if i had to go to war i really couldn t it wouldn t be too bad if they d just take you out and shoot you or something but you have to stay in the army so goddam long that s the whole trouble my brother d b wa in the army for four goddam year he wa in the war too he landed on d day and all but i really think he hated the army worse than the war i wa practically a child at the time but i remember when he used to come home on furlough and all all he did wa lie on his bed practically he hardly ever even came in the living room later when he went overseas and wa in the war and all he didn t get wounded or anything and he didn t have to shoot anybody all he had to do wa drive some cowboy general around all day in a command car he once told allie and i that if he d had to shoot anybody he wouldn t ve known which direction to shoot in he said the army wa practically a full of bastard a the nazi were i remember allie once asked him wasn t it sort of good that he wa in the war because he wa a writer and it gave him a lot to write about and all he made allie go get his baseball mitt and then he asked him who wa the best war poet rupert brooke or emily dickinson allie said emily dickinson i don t know too much about it myself because i don t read much poetry but i do know it d drive me crazy if i had to be in the army and be with a bunch of guy like ackley and stradlater and old maurice all the time marching with them and all i wa in the boy scout once for about a week and i couldn t even stand looking at the back of the guy s neck in front of me they kept telling you to look at the back of the guy s neck in front of you i swear if there s ever another war they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad i wouldn t object what get me about d b though he hated the war so much and yet he got me to read this book a farewell to arm last summer he said it wa so terrific that s what i can t understand it had this guy in it named lieutenant henry that wa supposed to be a nice guy and all i don t see how d b could hate the army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that i mean for instance i don t see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one by ring lardner or that other one he s so crazy about the great gatsby d b got sore when i said that and said i wa too young and all to appreciate it but i don t think so i told him i liked ring lardner and the great gatsby and all i did too i wa crazy about the great gatsby old gatsby old sport that killed me anyway i m sort of glad they ve got the atomic bomb invented if there s ever another war i m going to sit right the hell on top of it i ll volunteer for it i swear to god i will in case you don t live in new york the wicker bar is in this sort of swanky hotel the seton hotel i used to go there quite a lot but i don t any more i gradually cut it out it s one of those place that are supposed to be very sophisticated and all and the phony are coming in the window they used to have these two french babe tina and janine come out and play the piano and sing about three time every night one of them played the piano strictly lousy and the other one sang and most of the song were either pretty dirty or in french the one that sang old janine wa always whispering into the goddam microphone before she sang she d say and now we like to geeve you our impression of vooly voo fransay eet ee the story of a leetle fransh girl who come to a beeg ceety just like new york and fall een love wee a leetle boy from brookleen we hope you like eet then when she wa all done whispering and being cute a hell she d sing some dopey song half in english and half in french and drive all the phony in the place mad with joy if you sat around there long enough and heard all the phony applauding and all you got to hate everybody in the world i swear you did the bartender wa a louse too he wa a big snob he didn t talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a celebrity or something if you were a big shot or a celebrity or something then he wa even more nauseating he d go up to you and say with this big charming smile like he wa a helluva swell guy if you knew him well how s connecticut or how s florida it wa a terrible place i m not kidding i cut out going there entirely gradually it wa pretty early when i got there i sat down at the bar it wa pretty crowded and had a couple of scotch and soda before old luce even showed up i stood up when i ordered them so they could see how tall i wa and all and not think i wa a goddam minor then i watched the phony for a while some guy next to me wa snowing hell out of the babe he wa with he kept telling her she had aristocratic hand that killed me the other end of the bar wa full of flit they weren t too flitty looking i mean they didn t have their hair too long or anything but you could tell they were flit anyway finally old luce showed up old luce what a guy he wa supposed to be my student adviser when i wa at whooton the only thing he ever did though wa give these sex talk and all late at night when there wa a bunch of guy in his room he knew quite a bit about sex especially pervert and all he wa always telling u about a lot of creepy guy that go around having affair with sheep and guy that go around with girl pant sewed in the lining of their hat and all and flit and lesbian old luce knew who every flit and lesbian in the united state wa all you had to do wa mention somebody anybody and old luce d tell you if he wa a flit or not sometimes it wa hard to believe the people he said were flit and lesbian and all movie actor and like that some of the one he said were flit were even married for god s sake you d keep saying to him you mean joe blow s a flit joe blow that big tough guy that play gangster and cowboy all the time old luce d say certainly he wa always saying certainly he said it didn t matter if a guy wa married or not he said half the married guy in the world were flit and didn t even know it he said you could turn into one practically overnight if you had all the trait and all he used to scare the hell out of u i kept waiting to turn into a flit or something the funny thing about old luce i used to think he wa sort of flitty himself in a way he wa always saying try this for size and then he d goose the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor and whenever he went to the can he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were brushing your teeth or something that stuff s sort of flitty it really is i ve known quite a few real flit at school and all and they re always doing stuff like that and that s why i always had my doubt about old luce he wa a pretty intelligent guy though he really wa he never said hello or anything when he met you the first thing he said when he sat down wa that he could only stay a couple of minute he said he had a date then he ordered a dry martini he told the bartender to make it very dry and no olive hey i got a flit for you i told him at the end of the bar don t look now i been saving him for ya very funny he said same old caulfield when are you going to grow up i bored him a lot i really did he amused me though he wa one of those guy that sort of amuse me a lot how s your sex life i asked him he hated you to ask him stuff like that relax he said just sit back and relax for chrissake i m relaxed i said how s columbia ya like it certainly i like it if i didn t like it i wouldn t have gone there he said he could be pretty boring himself sometimes what re you majoring in i asked him pervert i wa only horsing around what re you trying to be funny no i m only kidding i said listen hey luce you re one of these intellectual guy i need your advice i m in a terrific he let out this big groan on me listen caulfield if you want to sit here and have a quiet peaceful drink and a quiet peaceful conver all right all right i said relax you could tell he didn t feel like discussing anything serious with me that s the trouble with these intellectual guy they never want to discus anything serious unless they feel like it so all i did wa i started discussing topic in general with him no kidding how s your sex life i asked him you still going around with that same babe you used to at whooton the one with the terrffic good god no he said how come what happened to her i haven t the faintest idea for all i know since you ask she s probably the whore of new hampshire by this time that isn t nice if she wa decent enough to let you get sexy with her all the time you at least shouldn t talk about her that way oh god old luce said is this going to be a typical caulfield conversation i want to know right now no i said but it isn t nice anyway if she wa decent and nice enough to let you must we pursue this horrible trend of thought i didn t say anything i wa sort of afraid he d get up and leave on me if i didn t shut up so all i did wa i ordered another drink i felt like getting stinking drunk who re you going around with now i asked him you feel like telling me nobody you know yeah but who i might know her girl life in the village sculptress if you must know yeah no kidding how old is she i ve never asked her for god s sake well around how old i should imagine she s in her late thirty old luce said in her late thirty yeah you like that i asked him you like em that old the reason i wa asking wa because he really knew quite a bit about sex and all he wa one of the few guy i knew that did he lost his virginity when he wa only fourteen in nantucket he really did i like a mature person if that s what you mean certainly you do why no kidding they better for sex and all listen let s get one thing straight i refuse to answer any typical caulfield question tonight when in hell are you going to grow up i didn t say anything for a while i let it drop for a while then old luce ordered another martini and told the bartender to make it a lot dryer listen how long you been going around with her this sculpture babe i asked him i wa really interested did you know her when you were at whooton hardly she just arrived in this country a few month ago she did where s she from she happens to be from shanghai no kidding she chinese for chrissake obviously no kidding do you like that her being chinese obviously why i d be interested to know i really would i simply happen to find eastern philosophy more satisfactory than western since you ask you do wuddaya mean philosophy ya mean sex and all you mean it s better in china that what you mean not necessarily in china for god s sake the east i said must we go on with this inane conversation listen i m serious i said no kidding why s it better in the east it s too involved to go into for god s sake old luce said they simply happen to regard sex a both a physical and a spiritual experience if you think i m so do i so do i regard it a a wuddayacallit a physical and spiritual experience and all i really do but it depends on who the hell i m doing it with if i m doing it with somebody i don t even not so loud for god s sake caulfield if you can t manage to keep your voice down let s drop the whole all right but listen i said i wa getting excited and i wa talking a little too loud sometimes i talk a little loud when i get excited this is what i mean though i said i know it s supposed to be physical and spiritual and artistic and all but what i mean is you can t do it with everybody every girl you neck with and all and make it come out that way can you let s drop it old luce said do you mind all right but listen take you and this chinese babe what s so good about you two drop it i said i wa getting a little too personal i realize that but that wa one of the annoying thing about luce when we were at whooton he d make you describe the most personal stuff that happened to you but if you started asking him question about himself he got sore these intellectual guy don t like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless they re running the whole thing they always want you to shut up when they shut up and go back to your room when they go back to their room when i wa at whooton old luce used to hate it you really could tell he did when after he wa finished giving his sex talk to a bunch of u in his room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves for a while i mean the other guy and myself in somebody else s room old luce hated that he always wanted everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he wa finished being the big shot the thing he wa afraid of he wa afraid somebody d say something smarter than he had he really amused me maybe i ll go to china my sex life is lousy i said naturally your mind is immature it is it really is i know it i said you know what the trouble with me is i can never get really sexy i mean really sexy with a girl i don t like a lot i mean i have to like her a lot if i don t i sort of lose my goddam desire for her and all boy it really screw up my sex life something awful my sex life stink naturally it doe for god s sake i told you the last time i saw you what you need you mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all i said that s what he d told me i ought to do his father wa a psychoanalyst and all it s up to you for god s sake it s none of my goddam business what you do with your life i didn t say anything for a while i wa thinking supposing i went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all i said what would he do to me i mean what would he do to me he wouldn t do a goddam thing to you he d simply talk to you and you d talk to him for god s sake for one thing he d help you to recognize the pattern of your mind the what the pattern of your mind your mind run in listen i m not giving an elementary course in psychoanalysis if you re interested call him up and make an appointment if you re not don t i couldn t care less frankly i put my hand on his shoulder boy he amused me you re a real friendly bastard i told him you know that he wa looking at his wrist watch i have to tear he said and stood up nice seeing you he got the bartender and told him to bring him his check hey i said just before he beat it did your father ever psychoanalyze you me why do you ask no reason did he though ha he not exactly he s helped me to adjust myself to a certain extent but an extensive analysis hasn t been necessary why do you ask no reason i wa just wondering well take it easy he said he wa leaving his tip and all and he wa starting to go have just one more drink i told him please i m lonesome a hell no kidding he said he couldn t do it though he said he wa late now and then he left old luce he wa strictly a pain in the as but he certainly had a good vocabulary he had the largest vocabulary of any boy at whooton when i wa there they gave u a test i kept sitting there getting drunk and waiting for old tina and janine to come out and do their stuff but they weren t there a flitty looking guy with wavy hair came out and played the piano and then this new babe valencia came out and sang she wasn t any good but she wa better than old tina and janine and at least she sang good song the piano wa right next to the bar where i wa sitting and all and old valencia wa standing practically right next to me i sort of gave her the old eye but she pretended she didn t even see me i probably wouldn t have done it but i wa getting drunk a hell when she wa finished she beat it out of the room so fast i didn t even get a chance to invite her to join me for a drink so i called the headwaiter over i told him to ask old valencia if she d care to join me for a drink he said he would but he probably didn t even give her my message people never give your message to anybody boy i sat at that goddam bar till around one o clock or so getting drunk a a bastard i could hardly see straight the one thing i did though i wa careful a hell not to get boisterous or anything i didn t want anybody to notice me or anything or ask how old i wa but boy i could hardly see straight when i wa really drunk i started that stupid business with the bullet in my gut again i wa the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their gut i kept putting my hand under my jacket on my stomach and all to keep the blood from dripping all over the place i didn t want anybody to know i wa even wounded i wa concealing the fact that i wa a wounded sonuvabitch finally what i felt like i felt like giving old jane a buzz and see if she wa home yet so i paid my check and all then i left the bar and went out where the telephone were i kept keeping my hand under my jacket to keep the blood from dripping boy wa i drunk but when i got inside this phone booth i wasn t much in the mood any more to give old jane a buzz i wa too drunk i guess so what i did i gave old sally hayes a buzz i had to dial about twenty number before i got the right one boy wa i blind hello i said when somebody answered the goddam phone i sort of yelled it i wa so drunk who is this this very cold lady s voice said this is me holden caulfield lem me speaka sally please sally s asleep this is sally s grandmother why are you calling at this hour holden do you know what time it is yeah wan na talka sally

and go to bed she hung up on me g night g night sally baby sally sweetheart darling i said can you imagine how drunk i wa i hung up too then i figured she probably just came home from a date i pictured her out with the lunt and all somewhere and that andover jerk all of them swimming around in a goddam pot of tea and saying sophisticated stuff to each other and being charming and phony i wished to god i hadn t even phoned her when i m drunk i m a madman i stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while i kept holding onto the phone sort of so i wouldn t pas out i wasn t feeling too marvelous to tell you the truth finally though i came out and went in the men s room staggering around like a moron and filled one of the washbowl with cold water then i dunked my head in it right up to the ear i didn t even bother to dry it or anything i just let the sonuvabitch drip then i walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down on it it wa nice and warm it felt good because i wa shivering like a bastard it s a funny thing i always shiver like hell when i m drunk i didn t have anything else to do so i kept sitting on the radiator and counting these little white square on the floor i wa getting soaked about a gallon of water wa dripping down my neck getting all over my collar and tie and all but i didn t give a damn i wa too drunk to give a damn then pretty soon the guy that played the piano for old valencia this very wavyhaired flitty looking guy came in to comb his golden lock we sort of struck up a conversation while he wa combing it except that he wasn t too goddam friendly hey you gon na see that valencia babe when you go back in the bar i asked him it s highly probable he said witty bastard all i ever meet is witty bastard listen give her my compliment ask her if that goddam waiter gave her my message willya why don t you go home mac how old are you anyway eighty six listen give her my compliment okay why don t you go home mac not me boy you can play that goddam piano i told him i wa just flattering him he played the piano stinking if you want to know the truth you oughta go on the radio i said handsome chap like you all those goddam golden lock ya need a manager go home mac like a good guy go home and hit the sack no home to go to no kidding you need a manager he didn t answer me he just went out he wa all through combing his hair and patting it and all so he left like stradlater all these handsome guy are the same when they re done combing their goddam hair they beat it on you when i finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat check room i wa cry and all i don t know why but i wa i guess it wa because i wa feeling so damn depressed and lonesome then when i went out to the checkroom i couldn t find my goddam check the hat check girl wa very nice about it though she gave me my coat anyway and my little shirley bean record i still had it with me and all i gave her a buck for being so nice but she wouldn t take it she kept telling me to go home and go to bed i sort of tried to make a date with her for when she got through working but she wouldn t do it she said she wa old enough to be my mother and all i showed her my goddam gray hair and told her i wa forty two i wa only horsing around naturally she wa nice though i showed her my goddam red hunting hat and she liked it she made me put it on before i went out because my hair wa still pretty wet she wa all right i didn t feel too drunk any more when i went outside but it wa getting very cold out again and my teeth started chattering like hell i couldn t make them stop i walked over to madison avenue and started to wait around for a bus because i didn t have hardly any money left and i had to start economizing on cab and all but i didn t feel like getting on a damn bus and besides i didn t even know where i wa supposed to go so what i did i started walking over to the park i figured i d go by that little lake and see what the hell the duck were doing see if they were around or not i still didn t know if they were around or not it wasn t far over to the park and i didn t have anyplace else special to go to i didn t even know where i wa going to sleep yet so i went i wasn t tired or anything i just felt blue a hell then something terrible happened just a i got in the park i dropped old phoebe s record it broke into about fifty piece it wa in a big envelope and all but it broke anyway i damn near cried it made me feel so terrible but all i did wa i took the piece out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket they weren t any good for anything but i didn t feel like just throwing them away then i went in the park boy wa it dark i ve lived in new york all my life and i know central park like the back of my hand because i used to roller skate there all the time and ride my bike when i wa a kid but i had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night i knew right where it wa it wa right near central park south and all but i still couldn t find it i must ve been drunker than i thought i kept walking and walking and it kept getting darker and darker and spookier and spookier i didn t see one person the whole time i wa in the park i m just a glad i probably would ve jumped about a mile if i had then finally i found it what it wa it wa partly frozen and partly not frozen but i didn t see any duck around i walked all around the whole damn lake i damn near fell in once in fact but i didn t see a single duck i thought maybe if there were any around they might be asleep or something near the edge of the water near the grass and all that s how i nearly fell in but i couldn t find any finally i sat down on this bench where it wasn t so goddam dark boy i wa still shivering like a bastard and the back of my hair even though i had my hunting hat on wa sort of full of little hunk of ice that worried me i thought probably i d get pneumonia and die i started picturing million of jerk coming to my funeral and all my grandfather from detroit that keep calling out the number of the street when you ride on a goddam bus with him and my aunt i have about fifty aunt and all my lousy cousin what a mob d be there they all came when allie died the whole goddam stupid bunch of them i have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he looked lying there d b told me i wasn t there i wa still in the hospital i had to go to the hospital and all after i hurt my hand anyway i kept worrying that i wa getting pneumonia with all those hunk of ice in my hair and that i wa going to die i felt sorry a hell for my mother and father especially my mother because she still isn t over my brother allie yet i kept picturing her not knowing what to do with all my suit and athletic equipment and all the only good thing i knew she wouldn t let old phoebe come to my goddam funeral because she wa only a little kid that wa the only good part then i thought about the whole bunch of them sticking me in a goddam cemetery and all with my name on this tombstone and all surrounded by dead guy boy when you re dead they really fix you up i hope to hell when i do die somebody ha sense enough to just dump me in the river or something anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery people coming and putting a bunch of flower on your stomach on sunday and all that crap who want flower when you re dead nobody when the weather s nice my parent go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flower on old allie s grave i went with them a couple of time but i cut it out in the first place i certainly don t enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery surrounded by dead guy and tombstone and all it wasn t too bad when the sun wa out but twice twice we were there when it started to rain it wa awful it rained on his lousy tombstone and it rained on the grass on his stomach it rained all over the place all the visitor that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their car that s what nearly drove me crazy all the visitor could get in their car and turn on their radio and all and then go someplace nice for dinner everybody except allie i couldn t stand it i know it s only his body and all that s in the cemetery and his soul s in heaven and all that crap but i couldn t stand it anyway i just wish he wasn t there you didn t know him if you d known him you d know what i mean it s not too bad when the sun s out but the sun only come out when it feel like coming out after a while just to get my mind off getting pneumonia and all i took out my dough and tried to count it in the lousy light from the street lamp all i had wa three single and five quarter and a nickel left boy i spent a fortune since i left pencey then what i did i went down near the lagoon and i sort of skipped the quarter and the nickel across it where it wasn t frozen i don t know why i did it but i did it i guess i thought it d take my mind off getting pneumonia and dying it didn t though i started thinking how old phoebe would feel if i got pneumonia and died it wa a childish way to think but i couldn t stop myself she d feel pretty bad if something like that happened she like me a lot i mean she s quite fond of me she really is anyway i couldn t get that off my mind so finally what i figured i d do i figured i d better sneak home and see her in case i died and all i had my door key with me and all and i figured what i d do i d sneak in the apartment very quiet and all and just sort of chew the fat with her for a while the only thing that worried me wa our front door it creak like a bastard it s a pretty old apartment house and the superintendent s a lazy bastard and everything creak and squeak i wa afraid my parent might hear me sneaking in but i decided i d try it anyhow so i got the hell out of the park and went home i walked all the way it wasn t too far and i wasn t tired or even drunk any more it wa just very cold and nobody around anywhere the best break i had in year when i got home the regular night elevator boy pete wasn t on the car some new guy i d never seen wa on the car so i figured that if i didn t bump smack into my parent and all i d be able to say hello to old phoebe and then beat it and nobody d even know i d been around it wa really a terrific break what made it even better the new elevator boy wa sort of on the stupid side i told him in this very casual voice to take me up to the dicksteins the dicksteins were these people that had the other apartment on our floor i d already taken off my hunting hat so a not to look suspicious or anything i went in the elevator like i wa in a terrific hurry he had the elevator door all shut and all and wa all set to take me up and then he turned around and said they ain t in they re at a party on the fourteenth floor that s all right i said i m supposed to wait for them i m their nephew he gave me this sort of stupid suspicious look you better wait in the lobby fella he said i d like to i really would i said but i have a bad leg i have to hold it in a certain position i think i d better sit down in the chair outside their door he didn t know what the hell i wa talking about so all he said wa oh and took me up not bad boy it s funny all you have to do is say something nobody understands and they ll do practically anything you want them to i got off at our floor limping like a bastard and started walking over toward the dicksteins side then when i heard the elevator door shut i turned around and went over to our side i wa doing all right i didn t even feel drunk anymore then i took out my door key and opened our door quiet a hell then very very carefully and all i went inside and closed the door i really should ve been a crook it wa dark a hell in the foyer naturally and naturally i couldn t turn on any light i had to be careful not to bump into anything and make a racket i certainly knew i wa home though our foyer ha a funny smell that doesn t smell like anyplace else i don t know what the hell it is it isn t cauliflower and it isn t perfume i don t know what the hell it is but you always know you re home i started to take off my coat and hang it up in the foyer closet but that closet s full of hanger that rattle like madman when you open the door so i left it on then i started walking very very slowly back toward old phoebe s room i knew the maid wouldn t hear me because she had only one eardrum she had this brother that stuck a straw down her ear when she wa a kid she once told me she wa pretty deaf and all but my parent especially my mother she ha ear like a goddam bloodhound so i took it very very easy when i went past their door i even held my breath for god s sake you can hit my father over the head with a chair and he won t wake up but my mother all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere in siberia and she ll hear you she s nervous a hell half the time she s up all night smoking cigarette finally after about an hour i got to old phoebe s room she wasn t there though i forgot about that i forgot she always sleep in d b s room when he s away in hollywood or some place she like it because it s the biggest room in the house also because it ha this big old madman desk in it that d b bought off some lady alcoholic in philadelphia and this big gigantic bed that s about ten mile wide and ten mile long i don t know where he bought that bed anyway old phoebe like to sleep in d b s room when he s away and he let her you ought to see her doing her homework or something at that crazy desk it s almost a big a the bed you can hardly see her when she s doing her homework that s the kind of stuff she like though she doesn t like her own room because it s too little she say she say she like to spread out that kill me what s old phoebe got to spread out nothing anyway i went into d b s room quiet a hell and turned on the lamp on the desk old phoebe didn t even wake up when the light wa on and all i sort of looked at her for a while she wa laying there asleep with her face sort of on the side of the pillow she had her mouth way open it s funny you take adult they look lousy when they re asleep and they have their mouth way open but kid don t kid look all right they can even have spit all over the pillow and they still look all right i went around the room very quiet and all looking at stuff for a while i felt swell for a change i didn t even feel like i wa getting pneumonia or anything any more i just felt good for a change old phoebe s clothes were on this chair right next to the bed she s very neat for a child i mean she doesn t just throw her stuff around like some kid she s no slob she had the jacket to this tan suit my mother bought her in canada hung up on the back of the chair then her blouse and stuff were on the seat her shoe and sock were on the floor right underneath the chair right next to each other i never saw the shoe before they were new they were these dark brown loafer sort of like this pair i have and they went swell with that suit my mother bought her in canada my mother dress her nice she really doe my mother ha terrific taste in some thing she s no good at buying ice skate or anything like that but clothes she s perfect i mean phoebe always ha some dress on that can kill you you take most little kid even if their parent are wealthy and all they usually have some terrible dress on i wish you could see old phoebe in that suit my mother bought her in canada i m not kidding i sat down on old d b s desk and looked at the stuff on it it wa mostly phoebe s stuff from school and all mostly book the one on top wa called arithmetic is fun i sort of opened the first page and took a look at it this is what old phoebe had on it phoebe weatherfield caulfield b that killed me her middle name is josephine for god s sake not weatherfield she doesn t like it though every time i see her she s got a new middle name for herself the book underneath the arithmetic wa a geography and the book under the geography wa a speller she s very good in spelling she s very good in all her subject but she s best in spelling then under the speller there were a bunch of notebook she ha about five thousand notebook you never saw a kid with so many notebook i opened the one on top and looked at the first page it had on it bernice meet me at recess i have something very very important to tell you that wa all there wa on that page the next one had on it why ha south eastern alaska so many caning factory because there so much salmon why ha it valuable forest because it ha the right climate what ha our government done to make life easier for the alaskan eskimo look it up for tomorrow phoebe weatherfield caulfield phoebe weatherfield caulfield phoebe weatherfield caulfield phoebe w caulfield phoebe weatherfield caulfield esq please pas to shirley shirley you said you were sagitarius but your only taurus bring your skate when you come over to my house i sat there on d b s desk and read the whole notebook it didn t take me long and i can read that kind of stuff some kid s notebook phoebe s or anybody s all day and all night long kid s notebook kill me then i lit another cigarette it wa my last one i must ve smoked about three carton that day then finally i woke her up i mean i couldn t sit there on that desk for the rest of my life and besides i wa afraid my parent might barge in on me all of a sudden and i wanted to at least say hello to her before they did so i woke her up she wake up very easily i mean you don t have to yell at her or

now i said nobody s gon na kill me nobody s gon na even c mon phoeb take that goddam thing off your head nobody s gon na kill me she wouldn t take it off though you can t make her do something if she doesn t want to all she kept saying wa daddy s gon na kill you you could hardly understand her with that goddam pillow over her head nobody s gon na kill me use your head in the first place i m going

boy if she want to keep a pillow over her head she keep it phoebe please c mon outa there i kept saying c mon hey hey weatherfield c mon out she wouldn t come out though you can t even reason with her sometimes finally i got up and went out in the living room and got some cigarette out of the box on the table and stuck some in my pocket i wa all out when i came back she had the pillow off her head all right i knew she would but she still wouldn t look at me even though she wa laying on her back and all when i came around the side of the bed and sat down again she turned her crazy face the other way she wa ostracizing the hell out of me just like the fencing team at pencey when i left all the goddam foil on the subway how s old hazel weatherfield i said you write any new story about her i got that one you sent me right in my suitcase it s down at the station it s very good daddy ll kill you boy she really get something on her mind when she get something on her mind no he won t the worst he

colorado on this ranch don t make me laugh you can t even ride a horse who can t sure i can certainly i can they can teach you in about two minute i said stop picking at that she wa picking at that adhesive tape on her arm who gave you that haircut i asked her i just noticed what a stupid haircut somebody gave her it wa way too short none of your business she said she can be very snotty sometimes she can be quite snotty i suppose you failed in every single subject again she said very snotty it wa sort of funny too in a way she sound like a goddam schoolteacher sometimes and she s only a little child no i didn t i said i passed english then just for the hell of it i gave her a pinch on the behind it wa sticking way out in the breeze the way she wa laying on her side she ha hardly any behind i didn t do it hard but she tried to hit my hand anyway but she missed then all of a sudden she said oh why did you do it she meant why did i get the ax again it made me sort of sad the way she said it oh god phoebe don t ask me i m sick of everybody asking me that i said a million reason why it wa one of the worst school i ever went to it wa full of phony and mean guy you never saw so many mean guy in your life for instance if you were having a bull session in somebody s room and somebody wanted to come in nobody d let them in if they were some dopey pimply guy everybody wa always locking their door when somebody wanted to come in and they had this goddam secret fraternity that i wa too yellow not to join there wa this one pimply boring guy robert ackley that wanted to get in he kept trying to join and they wouldn t let him just because he wa boring and pimply i don t even feel like talking about it it wa a stinking school take my word old phoebe didn t say anything but she wa listen ing i could tell by the back of her neck that she wa listening she always listens when you tell her something and the funny part is she know half the time what the hell you re talking about she really doe i kept talking about old pencey i sort of felt like it even the couple of nice teacher on the faculty they were phony too i said there wa this one old guy mr spencer his wife wa always giving you hot chocolate and all that stuff and they were really pretty nice but you should ve seen him when the headmaster old thurmer came in the history class and sat down in the back of the room he wa always coming in and sitting down in the back of the room for about a half an hour he wa supposed to be incognito or something after a while he d be sitting back there and then he d start interrupting what old spencer wa saying to crack a lot of corny joke old spencer d practically kill himself chuckling and smiling and all like a if thurmer wa a goddam prince or something don t swear so much it would ve made you puke i swear it would i said then on veteran day they have this day veteran day that all the jerk that graduated from pencey around come back and walk all over the place with their wife and child and everybody you should ve seen this one old guy that wa about fifty what he did wa he came in our room and knocked on the door and asked u if we d mind if he used the bathroom the bathroom wa at the end of the corridor i don t know why the hell he asked u you know what he said he said he wanted to see if his initial were still in one of the can door what he did he carved his goddam stupid sad old initial in one of the can door about ninety year ago and he wanted to see if they were still there so my roommate and i walked him down to the bathroom and all and we had to stand there while he looked for his initial in all the can door he kept talking to u the whole time telling u how when he wa at pencey they were the happiest day of his life and giving u a lot of advice for the future and all boy did he depress me i don t mean he wa a bad guy he wasn t but you don t have to be a bad guy to depress somebody you can be a good guy and do it all you have to do to depress somebody is give them a lot of phony advice while you re looking for your initial in some can door that s all you have to do i don t know maybe it wouldn t have been so bad if he hadn t been all out of breath he wa all out of breath from just climbing up the stair and the whole time he wa looking for his initial he kept breathing hard with his nostril all funny and sad while he kept telling stradlater and i to get all we could out of pencey god phoebe i can t explain i just didn t like anything that wa happening at pencey i can t explain old phoebe said something then but i couldn t hear her she had the side of her mouth right smack on the pillow and i couldn t hear her what i said take your mouth away i can t hear you with your mouth that way you don t like anything that s happening it made me even more depressed when she said that yes i do yes i do sure i do don t say that why the hell do you say that because you don t you don t like any school you don t like a million thing you don t i do that s where you re wrong that s exactly where you re wrong why the hell do you have to say that i said boy wa she depressing me because you don t she said name one thing one thing one thing i like i said okay the trouble wa i couldn t concentrate too hot sometimes it s hard to concentrate one thing i like a lot you mean i asked her she didn t answer me though she wa in a cockeyed position way the hell over the other side of the bed she wa about a thousand mile away c mon answer me i said one thing i like a lot or one thing i just like you like a lot all right i said but the trouble wa i couldn t concentrate about all i could think of were those two nun that went around collecting dough in those beatup old straw basket especially the one with the glass with those iron rim and this boy i knew at elkton hill there wa this one boy at elkton hill named james castle that wouldn t take back something he said about this very conceited boy phil stabile james castle called him a very conceited guy and one of stabile s lousy friend went and squealed on him to stabile so stabile with about six other dirty bastard went down to james castle s room and went in and locked the goddam door and tried to make him take back what he said but he wouldn t do it so they started in on him i won t even tell you what they did to him it s too repulsive but he still wouldn t take it back old james castle and you should ve seen him he wa a skinny little weak looking guy with wrist about a big a pencil finally what he did instead of taking back what he said he jumped out the window i wa in the shower and all and even i could hear him land outside but i just thought something fell out the window a radio or a desk or something not a boy or anything then i heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stair so i put on my bathrobe and i ran downstairs too and there wa old james castle laying right on the stone step and all he wa dead and his teeth and blood were all over the place and nobody would even go near him he had on this turtleneck sweater i d lent him all they did with the guy that were in the room with him wa expel them they didn t even go to jail that wa about all i could think of though those two nun i saw at breakfast and this boy james castle i knew at elkton hill the funny part is i hardly even know james castle if you want to know the truth he wa one of these very quiet guy he wa in my math class but he wa way over on the other side of the room and he hardly ever got up to recite or go to the blackboard or anything some guy in school hardly ever get up to recite or go to the blackboard i think the only time i ever even had a conversation with him wa that time he asked me if he could borrow this turtleneck sweater i had i damn near dropped dead when he asked me i wa so surprised and all i remember i wa brushing my teeth in the can when he asked me he said his cousin wa coming in to take him for a drive and all i didn t even know he knew i had a turtleneck sweater all i knew about him wa that his name wa always right ahead of me at roll call cabel r cabel w castle caulfield i can still remember it if you want to know the truth i almost didn t lend him my sweater just because i didn t know him too well what i said to old phoebe she said something to me but i didn t hear her you can t even think of one thing yes i can yes i can well do it then i like allie i said and i like doing what i m doing right now sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff and allie s dead you always say that if somebody s dead and everything and in heaven then it isn t really i know he s dead don t you think i know that i can still like him though can t i just because somebody s dead you don t just stop liking them for god s sake especially if they were about a thousand time nicer than the people you know that re alive and all old phoebe didn t say anything when she can t think of anything to say she doesn t say a goddam word anyway i like it now i said i mean right now sitting here with you and just chewing the fat and horsing that isn t anything really it is so something really certainly it is why the hell isn t it people never think anything is anything really i m getting goddam sick of it stop swearing all right name something else name something you d like to be like a scientist or a lawyer or something i couldn t be a scientist i m no good in science well a lawyer like daddy and all lawyer are all right i guess but it doesn t appeal to me i said i mean they re all right if they go around saving innocent guy life all the time and like that but you don t do that kind of stuff if you re a lawyer all you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy car and drink martini and look like a hot shot and besides even if you did go around saving guy life and all how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guy life or because you did it because what you really wanted to do wa be a terrific lawyer with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial wa over the reporter and everybody the way it is in the dirty movie how would you know you weren t being a phony the trouble is you wouldn t i m not too sure old phoebe knew what the hell i wa talking about i mean she s only a little child and all but she wa listening at least if somebody at least listens it s not too bad daddy s going to kill you he s going to kill you she said i wasn t listening though i wa thinking about something else something crazy you know what i d like to be i said you know what i d like to be i mean if i had my goddam choice what stop swearing you know that song if a body catch a body comin through the rye i d like it s if a body meet a body coming through the rye old phoebe said it s a poem by robert burn i know it s a poem by robert burn she wa right though it is if a body meet a body coming through the rye i didn t know it then though i thought it wa if a body catch a body i said anyway i keep picturing all these little kid playing some game in this big field of rye and all thousand of little kid and nobody s around nobody big i mean except me and i m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff what i have to do i have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff i mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going i have to come out from somewhere and catch them that s all i d do all day i d just be the catcher in the rye and all i know it s crazy but that s the only thing i d really like to be i know it s crazy old phoebe didn t say anything for a long time then when she said something all she said wa daddy s going to kill you i don t give a damn if he doe i said i got up from the bed then because what i wanted to do i wanted to phone up this guy that wa my english teacher at elkton hill mr antolini he lived in new york now he quit elkton hill he took this job teaching english at n y u i have to make a phone call i told phoebe i ll be right back don t go to sleep i didn t want her to go to sleep while i wa in the living room i knew she wouldn t but i said it anyway just to make sure while i wa walking toward the door old phoebe said holden and i turned around she wa sitting way up in bed she looked so pretty i m taking belching lesson from this girl phyllis margulies she said listen i listened and i heard something but it wasn t much good i said then i went out in the living room and called up this teacher i had mr antolini i made it very snappy on the phone because i wa afraid my parent would barge in on me right in the middle of it they didn t though mr antolini wa very nice he said i could come right over if i wanted to i think i probably woke he and his wife up because it took them a helluva long time to answer the phone the first thing he asked me wa if anything wa wrong and i said no i said i d flunked out of pencey though i thought i might a well tell him he said good god when i said that he had a good sense of humor and all he told me to come right over if i felt like it he wa about the best teacher i ever had mr antolini he wa a pretty young guy not much older than my brother d b and you could kid around with him without losing your respect for him he wa the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped out the window i told you about james castle old mr antolini felt his pulse and all and then he took off his coat and put it over james castle and carried him all the way over to the infirmary he didn t even give a damn if his coat got all bloody when i got back to d b s room old phoebe d turned the radio on this dance music wa coming out she d turned it on low though so the maid wouldn t hear it you should ve seen her she wa sitting smack in the middle of the bed outside the cover with her leg folded like one of those yogi guy she wa listening to the music she kill me c mon i said you feel like dancing i taught her how to dance and all when she wa a tiny little kid she s a very good dancer i mean i just taught her a few thing she learned it mostly by herself you can t teach somebody how to really dance you have shoe on she said i ll take em off c mon she practically jumped off the bed and then she waited while i took my shoe off and then i danced with her for a while she s really damn good i don t like people that dance with little kid because most of the time it look terrible i mean if you re out at a restaurant somewhere and you see some old guy take his little kid out on the dance floor usually they keep yanking the kid s dress up in the back by mistake and the kid can t dance worth a damn anyway and it look terrible but i don t do it out in public with phoebe or anything we just horse around in the house it s different with her anyway because she can dance she can follow anything you do i mean if you hold her in close a hell so that it doesn t matter that your leg are so much longer she stay right with you you can cross over or do some corny dip or even jitterbug a little and she stay right with you you can even tango for god s sake we danced about four number in between number she s funny a hell she stay right in position she won t even talk or anything you both have to stay right in position and wait for the orchestra to start playing again that kill me you re not supposed to laugh or anything either anyway we danced about four number and then i turned off the radio old phoebe jumped back in bed and got under the cover i m improving aren t i she asked me and how i said i sat down next to her on the bed again i wa sort of out of breath i wa smoking so damn much i had hardly any wind she wasn t even out of breath feel my forehead she said all of a sudden why feel it just feel it once i felt it i didn t feel anything though doe it feel very feverish she said no is it supposed to yes i m making it feel it again i felt it again and i still didn t feel anything but i said i think it s starting to now i didn t want her to get a goddam inferiority complex she nodded i can make it go up to over the thermoneter thermometer who said so alice holmborg showed me how you cross your leg and hold your breath and think of something very very hot a radiator or something then your whole forehead get so hot you can burn somebody s hand that killed me i pulled my hand away from her forehead like i wa in terrific danger thanks for telling me i said oh i wouldn t ve burned your hand i d ve stopped before it got too shhh then quick a hell she sat way the hell up in bed she scared hell out of me when she did that what s the matter i said the front door she said in this loud whisper it s them i quick jumped up and ran over and turned off the light over the desk then i jammed out my cigarette on my shoe and put it in my pocket then i fanned hell out of the air to get the smoke out i shouldn t even have been smoking for god s sake then i grabbed my shoe and got in the closet and shut the door boy my heart wa beating like a bastard i heard my mother come in the room phoebe she said now stop that i saw the light young lady hello i heard old phoebe say i couldn t sleep did you have a good time marvelous my mother said but you could tell she didn t mean it she doesn t enjoy herself much when she go out why are you awake may i ask were you warm enough i wa warm enough i just couldn t sleep phoebe have you been smoking a cigarette in here tell me the truth please young lady what old phoebe said you heard me i just lit one for one second i just took one puff then i threw it out the window why may i ask i couldn t sleep i don t like that phoebe i don t like that at all my mother said do you want another blanket no thanks g night old phoebe said she wa trying to get rid of her you could tell how wa the movie my mother said excellent except alice s mother she kept leaning over and asking her if she felt grippy during the whole entire movie we took a taxi home let me feel your forehead i didn t catch anything she didn t have anything it wa just her mother well go to sleep now how wa your dinner lousy phoebe said you heard what your father said about using that word what wa lousy about it you had a lovely lamb chop i walked all over lexington avenue just to the lamb chop wa all right but charlene always breathes on me whenever she put something down she breathes all over the food and everything she breathes on everything well go to sleep give mother a kiss did you say your prayer i said them in the bathroom g night good night go right to sleep now i have a splitting headache my mother said she get headache quite frequently she really doe take a few aspirin old phoebe said holden ll be home on wednesday won t he so far a i know get under there now way down i heard my mother go out and close the door i waited a couple of minute then i came out of the closet i bumped smack into old phoebe when i did it because it wa so dark and she wa out of bed and coming to tell me i hurt you i said you had to whisper now because they were both home i got ta get a move on i said i found the edge of the bed in the dark and sat down on it and started putting on my shoe i wa pretty nervous i admit it don t go now phoebe whispered wait ll they re asleep no now now s the best time i said she ll be in the bathroom and daddy ll turn on the news or something now s the best time i could hardly tie my shoelace i wa so damn nervous not that they would ve killed me or anything if they d caught me home but it would ve been very unpleasant and all where the hell are ya i said to old phoebe it wa so dark i couldn t see her here she wa standing right next to me i didn t even see her i got my damn bag at the station i said listen you got any dough phoeb i m practically broke just my christmas dough for present and all i haven t done any shopping at all yet oh i didn t want to take her christmas dough you want some she said i don t want to take your christmas dough i can lend you some she said then i heard her over at d b s desk opening a million drawer and feeling around with her hand it wa pitch black it wa so dark in the room if you go away you won t see me in the play she said her voice sounded funny when she said it yes i will i won t go way before that you think i wan na miss the play i said what i ll do i ll probably stay at mr antolini s house till maybe tuesday night then i ll come home if i get a chance i ll phone ya here old phoebe said she wa trying to give me the dough but she couldn t find my hand where she put the dough in my hand hey i don t need all this i said just give me two buck is all no kidding here i tried to give it back to her but she wouldn t take it you can take it all you can pay me back bring it to the play how much is it for god s sake eight dollar and eighty five cent sixty five cent i spent some then all of a sudden i started to cry i couldn t help it i did it so nobody could hear me but i did it it scared hell out of old phoebe when i started doing it and she came over and tried to make me stop but once you get started you can t just stop on a goddam dime i wa still sitting on the edge of the bed when i did it and she put her old arm around my neck and i put my arm around her too but i still couldn t stop for a long time i thought i wa going to choke to death or something boy i scared hell out of poor old phoebe the damn window wa open and everything and i could feel her shivering and all because all she had on wa her pajama i tried to make her get back in bed but she wouldn t go finally i stopped but it certainly took me a long long time then i finished buttoning my coat and all i told her i d keep in touch with her she told me i could sleep with her if i wanted to but i said no that i d better beat it that mr antolini wa waiting for me and all then i took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her she like those kind of crazy hat she didn t want to take it but i made her i ll bet she slept with it on she really like those kind of hat then i told her again i d give her a buzz if i got a chance and then i left it wa a helluva lot easier getting out of the house than it wa getting in for some reason for one thing i didn t give much of a damn any more if they caught me i really didn t i figured if they caught me they caught me i almost wished they did in a way i walked all the way downstairs instead of taking the elevator i went down the back stair i nearly broke my neck on about ten million garbage pail but i got out all right the elevator boy didn t even see me he probably still think i m up at the dicksteins mr and mr antolini had this very swanky apartment over on sutton place with two step that you go down to get in the living room and a bar and all i d been there quite a few time because after i left elkton hill mr antoilni came up to our house for dinner quite frequently to find out how i wa getting along he wasn t married then then when he got married i used to play tennis with he and mr antolini quite frequently out at the west side tennis club in forest hill long island mr antolini belonged there she wa lousy with dough she wa about sixty year older than mr antolini but they seemed to get along quite well for one thing they were both very intellectual especially mr antolini except that he wa more witty than intellectual when you were with him sort of like d b mr antolini wa mostly serious she had asthma pretty bad they both read all d b s story mr antolini too and when d b went to hollywood mr antolini phoned him up and told him not to go he went anyway though mr antolini said that anybody that could write like d b had no business going out to hollywood that s exactly what i said practically i would have walked down to their house because i didn t want to spend any of phoebe s christmas dough that i didn t have to but i felt funny when i got outside sort of dizzy so i took a cab i didn t want to but i did i had a helluva time even finding a cab old mr antolini answered the door when i rang the bell after the elevator boy finally let me up the bastard he had on his bathrobe and slipper and he had a highball in one hand he wa a pretty sophisticated guy and he wa a pretty heavy drinker holden m boy he said my god he s grown another twenty inch fine to see you how are you mr antolini how s mr antolini we re both just dandy let s have that coat he took my coat off me and hung it up i expected to see a day old infant in your arm nowhere to turn snowflake in your eyelash he s a very witty guy sometimes he turned around and yelled out to the kitchen lillian how s the coffee coming lillian wa mr antolini s first name it s all ready she yelled back is that holden hello holden hello mr antolini you were always yelling when you were there that s because the both of them were never in the same room at the same time it wa sort of funny sit down holden mr antolini said you could tell he wa a little oiled up the room looked like they d just had a party glass were all over the place and dish with peanut in them excuse the appearance of the place he said we ve been entertaining some buffalo friend of mr antolini s some buffalo a a matter of fact i laughed and mr antolini yelled something in to me from the kitchen but i couldn t hear her what d she say i asked mr antolini she said not to look at her when she come in she just arose from the sack have a cigarette are you smoking now thanks i said i took a cigarette from the box he offered me just once in a while i m a moderate smoker i ll bet you are he said he gave me a light from this big lighter off the table so you and pencey are no longer one he said he always said thing that way sometimes it amused me a lot and sometimes it didn t he sort of did it a little bit too much i don t mean he wasn t witty or anything he wa but sometimes it get on your nerve when somebody s always saying thing like so you and pencey are no longer one d b doe it too much sometimes too what wa the trouble mr antolini asked me how d you do in english i ll show you the door in short order if you flunked english you little ace composition writer oh i passed english all right it wa mostly literature though i only wrote about two composition the whole term i said i flunked oral expression though they had this course you had to take oral expression that i flunked why oh i don t know i didn t feel much like going into it i wa still feeling sort of dizzy or something and i had a helluva headache all of a sudden i really did but you could tell he wa interested so i told him a little bit about it it s this course where each boy in class ha to get up in class and make a speech you know spontaneous and all and if the boy digresses at all you re supposed to yell digression at him a fast a you can it just about drove me crazy i got an f in it why oh i don t know that digression business got on my nerve i don t know the trouble with me is i like it when somebody digresses it s more interesting and all you don t care to have somebody stick to the point when he tell you something oh sure i like somebody to stick to the point and all but i don t like them to stick too much to the point i don t know i guess i don t like it when somebody stick to the point all the time the boy that got the best mark in oral expression were the one that stuck to the point all the time i admit it but there wa this one boy richard kinsella he didn t stick to the point too much and they were always yelling digression at him it wa terrible because in the first place he wa a very nervous guy i mean he wa a very nervous guy and his lip were always shaking whenever it wa his time to make a speech and you could hardly hear him if you were sitting way in the back of the room when his lip sort of quit shaking a little bit though i liked his speech better than anybody else s he practically flunked the course though too he got a d plus because they kept yelling digression at him all the time for instance he made this speech about this farm his father bought in vermont they kept yelling digression at him the whole time he wa making it and this teacher mr vinson gave him an f on it because he hadn t told what kind of animal and vegetable and stuff grew on the farm and all what he did wa richard kinsella he d start telling you all about that stuff then all of a sudden he d start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle and how his uncle got polio and all when he wa forty two year old and how he wouldn t let anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didn t want anybody to see him with a brace on it didn t have much to do with the farm i admit it but it wa nice it s nice when somebody tell you about their uncle especially when they start out telling you about their father s farm and then all of a sudden get more interested in their uncle i mean it s dirty to keep yelling digression at him when he s all nice and excited i don t know it s hard to explain i didn t feel too much like trying either for one thing i had this terrific headache all of a sudden i wished to god old mr antolini would come in with the coffee that s something that annoys hell out of me i mean if somebody say the coffee s all ready and it isn t holden one short faintly stuffy pedagogical question don t you think there s a time and place for everything don t you think if someone start out to tell you about his father s farm he should stick to his gun then get around to telling you about his uncle s brace or if his uncle s brace is such a provocative subject shouldn t he have selected it in the first place a his subject not the farm i didn t feel much like thinking and answering and all i had a headache and i felt lousy i even had sort of a stomach ache if you want to know the truth yes i don t know i guess he should i mean i guess he should ve picked his uncle a a subject instead of the farm if that interested him most but what i mean is lot of time you don t know what interest you most till you start talking about something that doesn t interest you most i mean you can t help it sometimes what i think is you re supposed to leave somebody alone if he s at least being interesting and he s getting all excited about something i like it when somebody get excited about something it s nice you just didn t know this teacher mr vinson he could drive you crazy sometimes him and the goddam class i mean he d keep telling you to unify and simplify all the time some thing you just can t do that to i mean you can t hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody want you to you didn t know this guy mr vinson i mean he wa very intelligent and all but you could tell he didn t have too much brain coffee gentleman finally mr antolini said she came in carrying this tray with coffee and cake and stuff on it holden don t you even peek at me i m a mess hello mr antolini i said i started to get up and all but mr antolini got hold of my jacket and pulled me back down old mr antolini s hair wa full of those iron curler job and she didn t have any lipstick or anything on she didn t look too gorgeous she looked pretty old and all i ll leave this right here just dive in you two she said she put the tray down on the cigarette table pushing all these glass out of the way how s your mother holden she s fine thanks i haven t seen her too recently but the last i darling if holden need anything everything s in the linen closet the top shelf i m going to bed i m exhausted mr antolini said she looked it too can you boy make up the couch by yourselves we ll take care of everything you run along to bed mr antolini said he gave mr antolini a kiss and she said good by to me and went in the bedroom they were always kissing each other a lot in public i had part of a cup of coffee and about half of some cake that wa a hard a a rock all old mr antolini had wa another highball though he make them strong too you could tell he may get to be an alcoholic if he doesn t watch his step i had lunch with your dad a couple of week ago he said all of a sudden did you know that no i didn t you re aware of course that he s terribly concerned about you i know it i know he is i said apparently before he phoned me he d just had a long rather harrowing letter from your latest headmaster to the effect that you were making absolutely no effort at all cutting class coming unprepared to all your class in general being an all around i didn t cut any class you weren t allowed to cut any there were a couple of them i didn t attend once in a while like that oral expression i told you about but i didn t cut any i didn t feel at all like discussing it the coffee made my stomach feel a little better but i still had this awful headache mr antolini lit another cigarette he smoked like a fiend then he said frankly i don t know what the hell to say to you holden i know i m very hard to talk to i realize that i have a feeling that you re riding for some kind of a terrible terrible fall but i don t honestly know what kind are you listening to me yes you could tell he wa trying to concentrate and all it may be the kind where at the age of thirty you sit in some bar hating everybody who come in looking a if he might have played football in college then again you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say it s a secret between he and i or you may end up in some business office throwing paper clip at the nearest stenographer i just don t know but do you know what i m driving at at all yes sure i said i did too but you re wrong about that hating business i mean about hating football player and all you really are i don t hate too many guy what i may do i may hate them for a little while like this guy stradlater i knew at pencey and this other boy robert ackley i hated them once in a while i admit it but it doesn t last too long is what i mean after a while if i didn t see them if they didn t come in the room or if i didn t see them in the dining room for a couple of meal i sort of missed them i mean i sort of missed them mr antolini didn t say anything for a while he got up and got another hunk of ice and put it in his drink then he sat down again you could tell he wa thinking i kept wishing though that he d continue the conversation in the morning instead of now but he wa hot people are mostly hot to have a discussion when you re not all right listen to me a minute now i may not word this a memorably a i d like to but i ll write you a letter about it in a day or two then you can get it all straight but listen now anyway he started concentrating again then he said this fall i think you re riding for it s a special kind of fall a horrible kind the man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom he just keep falling and falling the whole arrangement s designed for men who at some time or other in their life were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with so they gave up looking they gave it up before they ever really even got started you follow me yes sir sure yes he got up and poured some more booze in his glass then he sat down again he didn t say anything for a long time i don t want to scare you he said but i can very clearly see you dying nobly one way or another for some highly unworthy cause he gave me a funny look if i write something down for you will you read it carefully and keep it yes sure i said i did too i still have the paper he gave me he went over to this desk on the other side of the room and without sitting down wrote something on a piece of paper then he came back and sat down with the paper in his hand oddly enough this wasn t written by a practicing poet it wa written by a psychoanalyst named wilhelm stekel here s what he are you still with me yes sure i am here s what he said the mark of the immature man is that he want to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he want to live humbly for one he leaned over and handed it to me i read it right when he gave it to me and then i thanked him and all and put it in my pocket it wa nice of him to go to all that trouble it really wa the thing wa though i didn t feel much like concentrating boy i felt so damn tired all of a sudden you could tell he wasn t tired at all though he wa pretty oiled up for one thing i think that one of these day he said you re going to have to find out where you want to go and then you ve got to start going there but immediately you can t afford to lose a minute not you i nodded because he wa looking right at me and all but i wasn t too sure what he wa talking about i wa pretty sure i knew but i wasn t too positive at the time i wa too damn tired and i hate to tell you he said but i think that once you have a fair idea where you want to go your first move will be to apply yourself in school you ll have to you re a student whether the idea appeal to you or not you re in love with knowledge and i think you ll find once you get past all the mr vineses and their oral comp mr vinson i said he meant all the mr vinson not all the mr vineses i shouldn t have interrupted him though all right the mr vinson once you get past all the mr vinson you re going to start getting closer and closer that is if you want to and if you look for it and wait for it to the kind of information that will be very very dear to your heart among other thing you ll find that you re not the first person who wa ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior you re by no mean alone on that score you ll be excited and stimulated to know many many men have been just a troubled morally and spiritually a you are right now happily some of them kept record of their trouble you ll learn from them if you want to just a someday if you have something to offer someone will learn something from you it s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement and it isn t education it s history it s poetry he stopped and took a big drink out of his highball then he started again boy he wa really hot i wa glad i didn t try to stop him or anything i m not trying to tell you he said that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world it s not so but i do say that educated and scholarly men if they re brilliant and creative to begin with which unfortunately is rarely the case tend to leave infinitely more valuable record behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative they tend to express themselves more clearly and they usually have a passion for following their thought through to the end and most important nine time out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker do you follow me at all yes sir he didn t say anything again for quite a while i don t know if you ve ever done it but it s sort of hard to sit around waiting for somebody to say something when they re thinking and all it really is i kept trying not to yawn it wasn t that i wa bored or anything i wasn t but i wa so damn sleepy all of a sudden something else an academic education will do for you if you go along with it any considerable distance it ll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have what it ll fit and maybe what it won t after a while you ll have an idea what kind of thought your particular size mind should be wearing for one thing it may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on idea that don t suit you aren t becoming to you you ll begin to know your true measurement and dress your mind accordingly then all of a sudden i yawned what a rude bastard but i couldn t help it mr antolini just laughed though c mon he said and got up we ll fix up the couch for you i followed him and he went over to this closet and tried to take down some sheet and blanket and stuff that wa on the top shelf but he couldn t do it with this highball glass in his hand so he drank it and then put the glass down on the floor and then he took the stuff down i helped him bring it over to the couch we both made the bed together he wasn t too hot at it he didn t tuck anything in very tight i didn t care though i could ve slept standing up i wa so tired how re all your woman they re okay i wa being a lousy conversationalist but i didn t feel like it how s sally he knew old sally hayes i introduced him once she s all right i had a date with her this afternoon boy it seemed like twenty year ago we don t have too much in common any more helluva pretty girl what about that other girl the one you told me about in maine oh jane gallagher she s all right i m probably gon na give her a buzz tomorrow we were all done making up the couch then it s all yours mr antolini said i don t know what the hell you re going to do with those leg of yours that s all right i m used to short bed i said thanks a lot sir you and mr antolini really saved my life tonight you know where the bathroom is if there s anything you want just holler i ll be in the kitchen for a while will the light bother you no heck no thanks a lot all right good night handsome g night sir thanks a lot he went out in the kitchen and i went in the bathroom and got undressed and all i couldn t brush my teeth because i didn t have any toothbrush with me i didn t have any pajama either and mr antolini forgot to lend me some so i just went back in the living room and turned off this little lamp next to the couch and then i got in bed with just my short on it wa way too short for me the couch but i really could ve slept standing up without batting an eyelash i laid awake for just a couple of second thinking about all that stuff mr antolini d told me about finding out the size of your mind and all he wa really a pretty smart guy but i couldn t keep my goddam eye open and i fell asleep then something happened i don t even like to talk about it i woke up all of a sudden i don t know what time it wa or anything but i woke up i felt something on my head some guy s hand boy it really scared hell out of me what it wa it wa mr antolini s hand what he wa doing wa he wa sitting on the floor right next to the couch in the dark and all and he wa sort of petting me or patting me on the goddam head boy i ll bet i jumped about a thousand foot what the hellya doing i said nothing i m simply sitting here admiring what re ya doing anyway i said over again i didn t know what the hell to say i mean i wa embarrassed a hell how bout keeping your voice down i m simply sitting here i have to go anyway i said boy wa i nervous i started putting on my damn pant in the dark i could hardly get them on i wa so damn nervous i know more damn pervert at school and all than anybody you ever met and they re always being perverty when i m around you have to go where mr antolini said he wa trying to act very goddam casual and cool and all but he wasn t any too goddam cool take my word i left my bag and all at the station i think maybe i d better go down and get them i have all my stuff in them they ll be there in the morning now go back to bed i m going to bed myself what s the matter with you nothing s the matter it s just that all my money and stuff s in one of my bag i ll be right back i ll get a cab and be right back i said boy i wa falling all over myself in the dark the thing is it isn t mine the money it s my mother s and i don t be ridiculous holden get back in that bed i m going to bed myself the money will be there safe and sound in the morn no no kidding i got ta get going i really do i wa damn near all dressed already except that i couldn t find my tie i couldn t remember where i d put my tie i put on my jacket and all without it old mr antolini wa sitting now in the big chair a little way away from me watching me it wa dark and all and i couldn t see him so hot but i knew he wa watching me all right he wa still boozing too i could see his trusty highball glass in his hand you re a very very strange boy i know it i said i didn t even look around much for my tie so i went without it good by sir i said thanks a lot no kidding he kept walking right behind me when i went to the front door and when i rang the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway all he said wa that business about my being a very very strange boy again strange my as then he waited in the doorway and all till the goddam elevator came i never waited so long for an elevator in my whole goddam life i swear i didn t know what the hell to talk about while i wa waiting for the elevator and he kept standing there so i said i m gon na start reading some good book i really am i mean you had to say something it wa very embarrassing you grab your bag and scoot right on back here again i ll leave the door unlatched thanks a lot i said g by the elevator wa finally there i got in and went down boy i wa shaking like a madman i wa sweating too when something perverty like that happens i start sweating like a bastard that kind of stuff s happened to me about twenty time since i wa a kid i can t stand it when i got outside it wa just getting light out it wa pretty cold too but it felt good because i wa sweating so much i didn t know where the hell to go i didn t want to go to another hotel and spend all phoebe s dough so finally all i did wa i walked over to lexington and took the subway down to grand central my bag were there and all and i figured i d sleep in that crazy waiting room where all the bench are so that s what i did it wasn t too bad for a while because there weren t many people around and i could stick my foot up but i don t feel much like discussing it it wasn t too nice don t ever try it i mean it it ll depress you i only slept till around nine o clock because a million people started coming in the waiting room and i had to take my foot down i can t sleep so hot if i have to keep my foot on the floor so i sat up i still had that headache it wa even worse and i think i wa more depressed than i ever wa in my whole life i didn t want to but i started thinking about old mr antolini and i wondered what he d tell mr antolini when she saw i hadn t slept there or anything that part didn t worry me too much though because i knew mr antolini wa very smart and that he could make up something to tell her he could tell her i d gone home or something that part didn t worry me much but what did worry me wa the part about how i d woke up and found him patting me on the head and all i mean i wondered if just maybe i wa wrong about thinking be wa making a flitty pas at ne i wondered if maybe he just liked to pat guy on the head when they re asleep i mean how can you tell about that stuff for sure you can t i even started wondering if maybe i should ve got my bag and gone back to his house the way i d said i would i mean i started thinking that even if he wa a flit he certainly d been very nice to me i thought how he hadn t minded it when i d called him up so late and how he d told me to come right over if i felt like it and how he went to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind and all and how he wa the only guy that d even gone near that boy james castle i told you about when he wa dead i thought about all that stuff and the more i thought about it the more depressed i got i mean i started thinking maybe i should ve gone back to his house maybe he wa only patting my head just for the hell of it the more i thought about it though the more depressed and screwed up about it i got what made it even worse my eye were sore a hell they felt sore and burny from not getting too much sleep besides that i wa getting sort of a cold and i didn t even have a goddam handkerchief with me i had some in my suitcase but i didn t feel like taking it out of that strong box and opening it up right in public and all there wa this magazine that somebody d left on the bench next to me so i started reading it thinking it d make me stop thinking about mr antolini and a million other thing for at least a little while but this damn article i started reading made me feel almost worse it wa all about hormone it described how you should look your face and eye and all if your hormone were in good shape and i didn t look that way at all i looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormone so i started getting worried about my hormone then i read this other article about how you can tell if you have cancer or not it said if you had any sore in your mouth that didn t heal pretty quickly it wa a sign that you probably had cancer i d had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two week so figured i wa getting cancer that magazine wa some little cheerer upper i finally quit reading it and went outside for a walk i figured i d be dead in a couple of month because i had cancer i really did i wa even positive i would be it certainly didn t make me feel too gorgeous it sort of looked like it wa going to rain but i went for this walk anyway for one thing i figured i ought to get some breakfast i wasn t at all hungry but i figured i ought to at least eat something i mean at least get something with some vitamin in it so i started walking way over east where the pretty cheap restaurant are because i didn t want to spend a lot of dough while i wa walking i passed these two guy that were unloading this big christmas tree off a truck one guy kept saying to the other guy hold the sonuvabitch up hold it up for chrissake it certainly wa a gorgeous way to talk about a christmas tree it wa sort of funny though in an awful way and i started to sort of laugh it wa about the worst thing i could ve done because the minute i started to laugh i thought i wa going to vomit i really did i even started to but it went away i don t know why i mean i hadn t eaten anything unsanitary or like that and usually i have quite a strong stomach anyway i got over it and i figured i d feel better if i had something to eat so i went in this very cheap looking restaurant and had doughnut and coffee only i didn t eat the doughnut i couldn t swallow them too well the thing is if you get very depressed about something it s hard a hell to swallow the waiter wa very nice though he took them back without charging me i just drank the coffee then i left and started walking over toward fifth avenue it wa monday and all and pretty near christmas and all the store were open so it wasn t too bad walking on fifth avenue it wa fairly christmasy all those scraggy looking santa clause were standing on corner ringing those bell and the salvation army girl the one that don t wear any lipstick or anything were tinging bell too i sort of kept looking around for those two nun i d met at breakfast the day before but i didn t see them i knew i wouldn t because they d told me they d come to new york to be schoolteacher but i kept looking for them anyway anyway it wa pretty christmasy all of a sudden a million little kid were downtown with their mother getting on and off bus and coming in and out of store i wished old phoebe wa around she s not little enough any more to go stark staring mad in the toy department but she enjoys horsing around and looking at the people the christmas before last i took her downtown shopping with me we had a helluva time i think it wa in bloomingdale s we went in the shoe department and we pretended she old phoebe wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoe the kind that have about a million hole to lace up we had the poor salesman guy going crazy old phoebe tried on about twenty pair and each time the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up it wa a dirty trick but it killed old phoebe we finally bought a pair of moccasin and charged them the salesman wa very nice about it i think he knew we were horsing around because old phoebe always start giggling anyway i kept walking and walking up fifth avenue without any tie on or anything then all of a sudden something very spooky started happening every time i came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb i had this feeling that i d never get to the other side of the street i thought i d just go down down down and nobody d ever see me again boy did it scare me you can t imagine i started sweating like a bastard my whole shirt and underwear and everything then i started doing something else every time i d get to the end of a block i d make believe i wa talking to my brother allie i d say to him allie don t let me disappear allie don t let me disappear allie don t let me disappear please allie and then when i d reach the other side of the street without disappearing i d thank him then it would start all over again a soon a i got to the next corner but i kept going and all i wa sort of afraid to stop i think i don t remember to tell you the truth i know i didn t stop till i wa way up in the sixty past the zoo and all then i sat down on this bench i could hardly get my breath and i wa still sweating like a bastard i sat there i guess for about an hour finally what i decided i d do i decided i d go away i decided i d never go home again and i d never go away to another school again i decided i d just see old phoebe and sort of say good by to her and all and give her back her christmas dough and then i d start hitchhiking my way out west what i d do i figured i d go down to the holland tunnel and bum a ride and then i d bum another one and another one and another one and in a few day i d be somewhere out west where it wa very pretty and sunny and where nobody d know me and i d get a job i figured i could get a job at a filling station somewhere putting gas and oil in people s car i didn t care what kind of job it wa though just so people didn t know me and i didn t know anybody i thought what i d do wa i d pretend i wa one of those deaf mute that way i wouldn t have to have any goddam stupid useless conversation with anybody if anybody wanted to tell me something they d have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me they d get bored a hell doing that after a while and then i d be through with having conversation for the rest of my life everybody d think i wa just a poor deaf mute bastard and they d leave me alone they d let me put gas and oil in their stupid car and they d pay me a salary and all for it and i d build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough i made and live there for the rest of my life i d build it right near the wood but not right in them because i d want it to be sunny a hell all the time i d cook all my own food and later on if i wanted to get married or something i d meet this beautiful girl that wa also a deaf mute and we d get married she d come and live in my cabin with me and if she wanted to say anything to me she d have to write it on a goddam piece of paper like everybody else if we had any child we d hide them somewhere we could buy them a lot of book and teach them how to read and write by ourselves i got excited a hell thinking about it i really did i knew the part about pretending i wa a deaf mute wa crazy but i liked thinking about it anyway but i really decided to go out west and all all i wanted to do first wa say good by to old phoebe so all of a sudden i ran like a madman across the street i damn near got killed doing it if you want to know the truth and went in this stationery store and bought a pad and pencil i figured i d write her a note telling her where to meet me so i could say good by to her and give her back her christmas dough and then i d take the note up to her school and get somebody in the principal s office to give it to her but i just put the pad and pencil in my pocket and started walking fast a hell up to her school i wa too excited to write the note right in the stationery store i walked fast because i wanted her to get the note before she went home for lunch and i didn t have any too much time i knew where her school wa naturally because i went there myself when i wa a kid when i got there it felt funny i wasn t sure i d remember what it wa like inside but i did it wa exactly the same a it wa when i went there they had that same big yard inside that wa always sort of dark with those cage around the light bulb so they wouldn t break if they got hit with a ball they had those same white circle painted all over the floor for game and stuff and those same old basketball ring without any net just the backboard and the ring nobody wa around at all probably because it wasn t recess period and it wasn t lunchtime yet all i saw wa one little kid a colored kid on his way to the bathroom he had one of those wooden pass sticking out of his hip pocket the same way we used to have to show he had permission and all to go to the bathroom i wa still sweating but not so bad any more i went over to the stair and sat down on the first step and took out the pad and pencil i d bought the stair had the same smell they used to have when i went there like somebody d just taken a leak on them school stair always smell like that anyway i sat there and wrote this note dear phoebe i can t wait around till wednesday any more so i will probably hitch hike out west this afternoon meet me at the museum of art near the door at quarter past if you can and i will give you your christmas dough back i didn t spend much love holden her school wa practically right near the museum and she had to pas it on her way home for lunch anyway so i knew she could meet me all right then i started walking up the stair to the principal s office so i could give the note to somebody that would bring it to her in her classroom i folded it about ten time so nobody d open it you can t trust anybody in a goddam school but i knew they d give it to her if i wa her brother and all while i wa walking up the stair though all of a sudden i thought i wa going to puke again only i didn t i sat down for a second and then i felt better but while i wa sitting down i saw something that drove me crazy somebody d written fuck you on the wall it drove me damn near crazy i thought how phoebe and all the other little kid would see it and how they d wonder what the hell it meant and then finally some dirty kid would tell them all cockeyed naturally what it meant and how they d all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of day i kept wanting to kill whoever d written it i figured it wa some perverty bum that d sneaked in the school late at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall i kept picturing myself catching him at it and how i d smash his head on the stone step till he wa good and goddam dead and bloody but i knew too i wouldn t have the gut to do it i knew that that made me even more depressed i hardly even had the gut to rub it off the wall with my hand if you want to know the truth i wa afraid some teacher would catch me rubbing it off and would think i d written it but i rubbed it out anyway finally then i went on up to the principal s office the principal didn t seem to be around but some old lady around a hundred year old wa sitting at a typewriter i told her i wa phoebe caulfield s brother in b and i asked her to please give phoebe the note i said it wa very important because my mother wa sick and wouldn t have lunch ready for phoebe and that she d have to meet me and have lunch in a drugstore she wa very nice about it the old lady she took the note off me and called some other lady from the next office and the other lady went to give it to phoebe then the old lady that wa around a hundred year old and i shot the breeze for a while she wa pretty nice and i told her how i d gone there to school too and my brother she asked me where i went to school now and i told her pencey and she said pencey wa a very good school even if i d wanted to i wouldn t have had the strength to straighten her out besides if she thought pencey wa a very good school let her think it you hate to tell new stuff to somebody around a hundred year old they don t like to hear it then after a while i left it wa funny she yelled good luck at me the same way old spencer did when i left pencey god how i hate it when somebody yell good luck at me when i m leaving somewhere it s depressing i went down by a different staircase and i saw another fuck you on the wall i tried to rub it off with my hand again but this one wa scratched on with a knife or something it wouldn t come off it s hopeless anyway if you had a million year to do it in you couldn t rub out even half the fuck you sign in the world it s impossible i looked at the clock in the recess yard and it wa only twenty to twelve so i had quite a lot of time to kill before i met old phoebe but i just walked over to the museum anyway there wasn t anyplace else to go i thought maybe i might stop in a phone booth and give old jane gallagher a buzz before i started bumming my way west but i wasn t in the mood for one thing i wasn t even sure she wa home for vacation yet so i just went over to the museum and hung around while i wa waiting around for phoebe in the museum right inside the door and all these two little kid came up to me and asked me if i knew where the mummy were the one little kid the one that asked me had his pant open i told him about it so he buttoned them up right where he wa standing talking to me he didn t even bother to go behind a post or anything he killed me i would ve laughed but i wa afraid i d feel like vomiting again so i didn t where re the mummy fella the kid said again ya know i horsed around with the two of them a little bit the mummy what re they i asked the one kid you know the mummy them dead guy that get buried in them toon and all toon that killed me he meant tomb how come you two guy aren t in school i said no school t day the kid that did all the talking said he wa lying sure a i m alive the little bastard i didn t have anything to do though till old phoebe showed up so i helped them find the place where the mummy were boy i used to know exactly where they were but i hadn t been in that museum in year you two guy so interested in mummy i said yeah can t your friend talk i said he ain t my friend he s my brudda can t he talk i looked at the one that wasn t doing any talking can t you talk at all i asked him yeah he said i don t feel like it finally we found the place where the mummy were and we went in you know how the egyptian buried their dead i asked the one kid naa well you should it s very interesting they wrapped their face up in these cloth that were treated with some secret chemical that way they could be buried in their tomb for thousand of year and their face wouldn t rot or anything nobody know how to do it except the egyptian even modern science to get to where the mummy were you had to go down this very narrow sort of hall with stone on the side that they d taken right out of this pharaoh s tomb and all it wa pretty spooky and you could tell the two hot shot i wa with weren t enjoying it too much they stuck close a hell to me and the one that didn t talk at all practically wa holding onto my sleeve let s go he said to his brother i seen em awreddy c mon hey he turned around and beat it he s got a yella streak a mile wide the other one said so long he beat it too i wa the only one left in the tomb then i sort of liked it in a way it wa so nice and peaceful then all of a sudden you d never guess what i saw on the wall another fuck you it wa written with a red crayon or something right under the glass part of the wall under the stone that s the whole trouble you can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful because there isn t any you may think there is but once you get there when you re not looking somebody ll sneak up and write fuck you right under your nose try it sometime i think even if i ever die and they stick me in a cemetery and i have a tombstone and all it ll say holden caulfield on it and then what year i wa born and what year i died and then right under that it ll say fuck you i m positive in fact after i came out of the place where the mummy were i had to go to the bathroom i sort of had diarrhea if you want to know the truth i didn t mind the diarrhea part too much but something else happened when i wa coming out of the can right before i got to the door i sort of passed out i wa lucky though i mean i could ve killed myself when i hit the floor but all i did wa sort of land on my side it wa a funny thing though i felt better after i passed out i really did my arm sort of hurt from where i fell but i didn t feel so damn dizzy any more it wa about ten after twelve or so then and so i went back and stood by the door and waited for old phoebe i thought how it might be the last time i d ever see her again any of my relative i mean i figured i d probably see them again but not for year i might come home when i wa about thirty five i figured in case somebody got sick and wanted to see me before they died but that would be the only reason i d leave my cabin and come back i even started picturing how it would be when i came back i knew my mother d get nervous a hell and start to cry and beg me to stay home and not go back to my cabin but i d go anyway i d be casual a hell i d make her calm down and then i d go over to the other side of the living room and take out this cigarette case and light a cigarette cool a all hell i d ask them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to but i wouldn t insist or anything what i d do i d let old phoebe come out and visit me in the summertime and on christmas vacation and easter vacation and i d let d b come out and visit me for a while if he wanted a nice quiet place for his writing but he couldn t write any movie in my cabin only story and book i d have this rule that nobody could do anything phony when they visited me if anybody tried to do anything phony they couldn t stay all of a sudden i looked at the clock in the checkroom and it wa twenty five of one i began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other lady not to give old phoebe my message i began to get scared that maybe she d told her to burn it or something it really scared hell out of me i really wanted to see old phoebe before i hit the road i mean i had her christmas dough and all finally i saw her i saw her through the glass part of the door the reason i saw her she had my crazy hunting hat on you could see that hat about ten mile away i went out the door and started down these stone stair to meet her the thing i couldn t understand she had this big suitcase with her she wa just coming across fifth avenue and she wa dragging this goddam big suitcase with her she could hardly drag it when i got up closer i saw it wa my old suitcase the one i used to use when i wa at whooton i couldn t figure out what the hell she wa doing with it hi she said when she got up close she wa all out of breath from that crazy suitcase i thought maybe you weren t coming i said what the hell s in that bag i don t need anything i m just going the way i am i m not even taking the bag i got at the station what the hellya got in there she put the suitcase down my clothes she said i m going with you can i okay what i said i almost fell over when she said that i swear to god i did i got sort of dizzy and i thought i wa going to pas out or something again i took them down the back elevator so charlene wouldn t see me it isn t heavy all i have in it is two dress and my moccasin and my underwear and sock and some other thing feel it it isn t heavy feel it once can t i go with you holden can t i please no shut up i thought i wa going to pas out cold i mean i didn t mean to tell her to shut up and all but i thought i wa going to pas out again why can t i please holden i won t do anything i ll just go with you that s all i won t even take my clothes with me if you don t want me to i ll just take my you can t take anything because you re not going i m going alone so shut up please holden please let me go i ll be very very very you won t even you re not going now shut up gim me that bag i said i took the bag off her i wa almost all set to hit her i thought i wa going to smack her for a second i really did she started to cry i thought you were supposed to be in a play at school and all i thought you were supposed to be benedict arnold in that play and all i said i said it very nasty whuddaya want to do not be in the play for god s sake that made her cry even harder i wa glad all of a sudden i wanted her to cry till her eye practically dropped out i almost hated her i think i hated her most because she wouldn t be in that play any more if she went away with me come on i said i started up the step to the museum again i figured what i d do wa i d check the crazy suitcase she d brought in the checkroom andy then she could get it again at three o clock after school i knew she couldn t take it back to school with her come on now i said she didn t go up the step with me though she wouldn t come with me i went up anyway though and brought the bag in the checkroom and checked it and then i came down again she wa still standing there on the sidewalk but she turned her back on me when i came up to her she can do that she can turn her back on you when she feel like it i m not going away anywhere i changed my mind so stop cry and shut up i said the funny part wa she wasn t even cry when i said that i said it anyway though c mon now i ll walk you back to school c mon now you ll be late she wouldn t answer me or anything i sort of tried to get hold of her old hand but she wouldn t let me she kept turning around on me didja have your lunch ya had your lunch yet i asked her she wouldn t answer me all she did wa she took off my red hunting hat the one i gave her and practically chucked it right in my face then she turned her back on me again it nearly killed me but i didn t say anything i just picked it up and stuck it in my coat pocket come on hey i ll walk you back to school i said i m not going back to school i didn t know what to say when she said that i just stood there for a couple of minute you have to go back to school you want to be in that play don t you you want to be benedict arnold don t you no sure you do certainly you do c mon now let s go i said in the first place i m not going away anywhere i told you i m going home i m going home a soon a you go back to school first i m gon na go down to the station and get my bag and then i m gon na go straight i said i m not going back to school you can do what you want to do but i m not going back to chool she said so shut up it wa the first time she ever told me to shut up it sounded terrible god it sounded terrible it sounded worse than swearing she still wouldn t look at me either and every time i sort of put my hand on her shoulder or something she wouldn t let me listen do you want to go for a walk i asked her do you want to take a walk down to the zoo if i let you not go back to school this afternoon and go for walk will you cut out this crazy stuff she wouldn t answer me so i said it over again if i let you skip school this afternoon and go for a little walk will you cut out the crazy stuff will you go back to school tomorrow like a good girl i may and i may not she said then she ran right the hell across the street without even looking to see if any car were coming she s a madman sometimes i didn t follow her though i knew she d follow me so i started walking downtown toward the zoo on the park side of the street and she started walking downtown on the other goddam side of the street she wouldn t look over at me at all but i could tell she wa probably watching me out of the corner of her crazy eye to see where i wa going and all anyway we kept walking that way all the way to the zoo the only thing that bothered me wa when a double decker bus came along because then i couldn t see across the street and i couldn t see where the hell she wa but when we got to the zoo i yelled over to her phoebe i m going in the zoo c mon now she wouldn t look at me but i could tell she heard me and when i started down the step to the zoo i turned around and saw she wa crossing the street and following me and all there weren t too many people in the zoo because it wa sort of a lousy day but there were a few around the sea lion swimming pool and all i started to go by but old phoebe stopped and made out she wa watching the sea lion getting fed a guy wa throwing fish at them so i went back i figured it wa a good chance to catch up with her and all i went up and sort of stood behind her and sort of put my hand on her shoulder but she bent her knee and slid out from me she can certainly be very snotty when she want to she kept standing there while the sea lion were getting fed and i stood right behind her i didn t put my hand on her shoulder again or anything because if i had she really would ve beat it on me kid are funny you have to watch what you re doing she wouldn t walk right next to me when we left the sea lion but she didn t walk too far away she sort of walked on one side of the sidewalk and i walked on the other side it wasn t too gorgeous but it wa better than having her walk about a mile away from me like before we went up and watched the bear on that little hill for a while but there wasn t much to watch only one of the bear wa out the polar bear the other one the brown one wa in his goddam cave and wouldn t come out all you could see wa his rear end there wa a little kid standing next to me with a cowboy hat on practically over his ear and he kept telling his father make him come out daddy make him come out i looked at old phoebe but she wouldn t laugh you know kid when they re sore at you they won t laugh or anything after we left the bear we left the zoo and crossed over this little street in the park and then we went through one of those little tunnel that always smell from somebody s taking a leak it wa on the way to the carrousel old phoebe still wouldn t talk to me or anything but she wa sort of walking next to me now i took a hold of the belt at the back of her coat just for the hell of it but she wouldn t let me she said keep your hand to yourself if you don t mind she wa still sore at me but not a sore a she wa before anyway we kept getting closer and closer to the carrousel and you could start to hear that nutty music it always play it wa playing oh marie it played that same song about fifty year ago when i wa a little kid that s one nice thing about carrousel they always play the same song i thought the carrousel wa closed in the wintertime old phoebe said it wa the first time she practically said anything she probably forgot she wa supposed to be sore at me maybe because it s around christmas i said she didn t say anything when i said that she probably remembered she wa supposed to be sore at me do you want to go for a ride on it i said i knew she probably did when she wa a tiny little kid and allie and d b and i used to go to the park with her she wa mad about the carrousel you couldn t get her off the goddam thing i m too big she said i thought she wasn t going to answer me but she did no you re not go on i ll wait for ya go on i said we were right there then there were a few kid riding on it mostly very little kid and a few parent were waiting around outside sitting on the bench and all what i did wa i went up to the window where they sell the ticket and bought old phoebe a ticket then i gave it to her she wa standing right next to me here i said wait a second take the rest of your dough too i started giving her the rest of the dough she d lent me you keep it keep it for me she said then she said right afterward please that s depressing when somebody say please to you i mean if it s phoebe or somebody that depressed the hell out of me but i put the dough back in my pocket aren t you gon na ride too she asked me she wa looking at me sort of funny you could tell she wasn t too sore at me any more maybe i will the next time i ll watch ya i said got your ticket yes go ahead then i ll be on this bench right over here i ll watch ya i went over and sat down on this bench and she went and got on the carrousel she walked all around it i mean she walked once all the way around it then she sat down on this big brown beat up looking old horse then the carrousel started and i watched her go around and around there were only about five or six other kid on the ride and the song the carrousel wa playing wa smoke get in your eye it wa playing it very jazzy and funny all the kid kept trying to grab for the gold ring and so wa old phoebe and i wa sort of afraid she d fall off the goddam horse but i didn t say anything or do anything the thing with kid is if they want to grab the gold ring you have to let them do it and not say anything if they fall off they fall off but it s bad if you say anything to them when the ride wa over she got off her horse and came over to me you ride once too this time she said no i ll just watch ya i think i ll just watch i said i gave her some more of her dough here get some more ticket she took the dough off me i m not mad at you any more she said i know hurry up the thing s gon na start again then all of a sudden she gave me a kiss then she held her hand out and said it s raining it s starting to rain i know then what she did it damn near killed me she reached in my coat pocket and took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head don t you want it i said you can wear it a while okay hurry up though now you re gon na miss your ride you won t get your own horse or anything she kept hanging around though did you mean it what you said you really aren t going away anywhere are you really going home afterwards she asked me yeah i said i meant it too i wasn t lying to her i really did go home afterwards hurry up now i said the thing s starting she ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back then she got on it she waved to me and i waved back boy it began to rain like a bastard in bucket i swear to god all the parent and mother and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel so they wouldn t get soaked to the skin or anything but i stuck around on the bench for quite a while i got pretty soaking wet especially my neck and my pant my hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection in a way but i got soaked anyway i didn t care though i felt so damn happy all of sudden the way old phoebe kept going around and around i wa damn near bawling i felt so damn happy if you want to know the truth i don t know why it wa just that she looked so damn nice the way she kept going around and around in her blue coat and all god i wish you could ve been there that s all i m going to tell about i could probably tell you what i did after i went home and how i got sick and all and what school i m supposed to go to next fall after i get out of here but i don t feel like it i really don t that stuff doesn t interest me too much right now a lot of people especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here keep asking me if i m going apply myself when i go back to school next september it s such a stupid question in my opinion i mean how do you know what you re going to do till you do it the answer is you don t i think i am but

live cartoon from the far side or classic comic joke about parenting retirement or grandkids the grape of wrath chapter one t o the red country and part of the gray country of oklahoma the last rain came gently and they did not cut the scarred earth the plow crossed and recrossed the rivulet mark the last rain lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colony and grass along the side of the road so that the gray country and the dark red coun try began to disappear under a green cover in the last part of may the sky grew pale and the cloud that had hung in high puff for so long in the spring were dissipated the sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet the cloud appeared and went away and in a while they did not try any more the weed grew darker green to protect them self and they did not spread any more the surface of the earth crusted a thin hard crust and a the sky became pale so the earth became pale pink in the red country and white in the gray country in the water cut gully the earth dusted down in dry lit tle stream gopher and ant lion started small avalanche and a the sharp sun struck day after day the leaf of the young corn became less stiff and erect they bent in a curve at first and then a the central rib of strength grew weak each leaf tilted downward then it wa june and the sun shone more fiercely the brown line on the com leaf widened and moved in on the central rib the weed frayed the grape of wrath and edged back toward their root the air wa thin and the sky more pale and every day the earth paled in the road where the team moved where the wheel milled the ground and the hoof of the horse beat the ground the dirt crust broke and the dust formed every moving thing lifted the dust into the air a walking man lifted a thin layer a high a his waist and a wagon lifted the dust a high a the fence top and an automobile boiled a cloud behind it the dust wa long in settling back again when june wa half gone the big cloud moved up out of texas and the gulf high heavy cloud rain head the men in the field looked up at the cloud and sniffed at them and held wet finger up to sense the wind and the horse were nervous while the cloud were up the rain head dropped a little spattering and hurried on to some other country behind them the sky wa pale again and the sun flared in the dust there were drop crater where the rain had fallen and there were clean splash on the com and that wa all a gentle wind followed the rain cloud driving them on northward a wind that softly clashed the drying corn a day went by and the wind increased steady unbroken by gust the dust from the road fluffed up and spread out and fell on the weed beside the field and fell into the field a little way now the wind grew strong and hard and it worked at the rain crust in the corn field little by little the sky wa darkened by the mixing dust and the wind felt over the earth loosened the dust and carried it away the wind grew stronger the rain crust broke and the dust lifted up out of the field and drove gray plume into the air like slug gish smoke the corn threshed the wind and made a dry the grape of wrath rushing sound the finest dust did not settle back to earth now but disappeared into the darkening sky the wind grew stronger whisked under stone carried up straw and old leaf and even little clod marking it course a it sailed across the field the air and the sky dark ened and through them the sun shone redly and there wa a raw sting in the air during a night the wind raced faster over the land dug cunningly among the rootlet of the com and the corn fought the wind with it weakened leaf until the root were freed by the prying wind and then each stalk settled wearily sideways toward the earth and pointed the direction of the wind the dawn came but no day in the gray sky a red sun appeared a dim red circle that gave a little light like dusk and a that day advanced the dusk slipped back toward darkness and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen com men and woman huddled in their house and they tied handkerchief over their nose when they went out and wore goggles to protect their eye when the night came again it wa black night for the star could not pierce the dust to get down and the window light could not even spread beyond their own yard now the dust wa evenly mixed with the air an emulsion of dust and air house were shut tight and cloth wedged around door and window but the dust came in so thinly that it could not be seen in the air and it settled like pollen on the chair and table on the dish the people brushed it from their shoulder little line of dust lay at the door sill in the middle of that night the wind passed on and left the land quiet the dust filled air muffled sound more com the grape of wrath pleteiy than fog doe the people lying in their bed heard the wind stop they awakened when the rushing wind wa gone they lay quietly and listened deep into the stillness then the rooster crowed and their voice were muffled and the people stirred restlessly in their bed and wanted the morning they knew it would take a long time for the dust to settle out of the air in the morning the dust hung like fog and the sun wa a red a ripe new blood all day the dust sifted down from the sky and the next day it sifted down an even blanket covered the earth it settled on the com piled up on the top of the fence post piled up on the wire it settled on roof blanketed the weed and tree the people came out of their house and smelled the hot stinging air and covered their nose from it and the chil dren came out of the house but they did not run or shout a they would have done after a rain men stood by their fence and looked at the ruined corn drying fast now only a little green showing through the film of dust the men were silent and they did not move often and the woman came out of the house to stand beside their men to feel whether this time the men would break the woman studied the men s face secretly for the com could go a long a something else remained the child stood near by drawing figure in the dust with bare toe and the child sent exploring sens out to see whether men and woman would break the child peeked at the face of the men and woman and then drew careful line in the dust with their toe horse came to the watering trough and nuzzled the water to clear the surface dust after a while the face of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became hard and angry and resistant then the woman knew that they were safe and that there wa no break then they asked what ll we do the grape of wrath ind the men replied i don t know but it wa all right the woman knew it wa all right and the watching child knew it wa all right woman and child knew deep in themselves that no misfortune wa too great to bear if their men were whole the woman went into the house to their work and the child began to play but cautiously at first a the day went forward the sun became less red it flared down on the dust blanketed land the men sat in the door way of their house their hand were busy with stick and little rock the men sat still thinking figuring gjjs chapter two a huge red transport truck stood in front of the lit tle roadside restaurant the vertical exhaust pipe l muttered softly and an almost invisible haze of steel blue smoke hovered over it end it wa a new truck shining red and in twelve inch letter on it side oklahoma city transport company it double tire were new and a brass padlock stood straight out from the hasp on the big back door inside the screened restaurant a radio played quiet dance music turned low the way it is when no one is listening a small outlet fan turned silently in it circular hole over the entrance and fly buzzed excitedly about the door and window butting the screen inside one man the truck driver sat on a stool and rested his el bow on the counter and looked over his coffee at the lean and lonely waitress he talked the smart listless language of the roadside to her i seen him about three month ago he had a operation cut somepin out i forget what and she doesn t seem no longer than a week i seen him myself looked fine then he s a nice sort of a guy when he ain t stinko now and then the fly roared softly at the screen door the coffee machine spurted steam and the waitress without looking reached behind her and shut it off outside a man walking along the edge of the highway crossed over and approached the truck he walked slowly to the front of it put his hand on the shiny fender and the grape of wrath looked at the no rider sticker on the windshield for a moment he wa about to walk on down the road but instead he sat on the running board on the side away from the re taurant he wa not over thirty his eye were very dark brown and there wa a hint of brown pigment in his eyeball his cheek bone were high and wide and strong deep line cut down his cheek in curve beside his mouth his upper lip wa long and since his teeth protruded the lip stretched to cover them for this man kept his lip closed his hand were hard with broad finger and nail a thick and ridged a little clam shell the space between thumb and forefinger and the ham of his hand were shiny with callus the man s clothes were new all of them cheap and new his gray cap wa so new that the visor wa still stiff and the button still on not shapeless and bulged a it would be when it had served for a while all the various purpose of a cap carrying sack towel handkerchief his suit wa of cheap gray hardcloth and so new that there were crease in the trouser his blue chambray shirt wa stiff and smooth with filler the coat wa too big the trouser too short for he wa a tall man the coat shoulder peak hung down on his arm and even then the sleeve were too short and the front of the coat flapped loosely over his stomach he wore a pair of new tan shoe of the kind called army last hob nailed and with half circle like horseshoe to protect the edge of the heel from wear this man sat on the running board and took off his cap and mopped his face with it then he put on the cap and by pulling started the future ruin of the visor his foot caught his attention he leaned down and loosened the shoelace and did not tie the end again over his head the exhaust of the diesel engine whispered in quick puff of blue smoke io the grape of wrath the music stopped in the restaurant and a man s voice spoke from the loudspeaker but the waitress did not turn him off for she didn t know the music had stopped her ex ploring finger had found a lump under her ear she wa trying to see it in a mirror behind the counter without let ting the truck driver know and so she pretended to push a bit of hair to neatness the truck driver said they wa a big dance in shawnee i heard somebody got killed or some pin you hear anything no said the waitress and she lovingly fingered the lump under her ear outside the seated man stood up and looked over the cowl of the truck and watched the restaurant for a moment then he settled back on the running board pulled a sack of tobacco and a book of paper from his side pocket he rolled his cigarette slowly and perfectly studied it smoothed it at last he lighted it and pushed the burning match into the dust at his foot the sun cut into the shade of the truck a noon approached in the restaurant the truck driver paid his bill and put his two nickel change in a slot machine the whirling cylin ders gave him no score they fix em so you can t win nothing he said to the waitress and she replied guy took the jackpot not two hour ago three eighty he got how soon you gon na be back by he held the screen door a little open week ten day he said got to make a run to tulsa an i never get back soon a i think she said crossly don t let the fly in either go out or come in so long he said and pushed his way out the screen door banged behind him he stood in the sun peeling the mril f the grape of wrath wrapper from a piece of gum he wa a heavy man broad in the shoulder thick in the stomach his face wa red and his blue eye long and slitted from having squinted always at sharp light he wore army trouser and high laced boot holding the stick of gum in front of his lip he called through the screen well don t do nothing you don t want me to hear about the waitress wa turned toward a mirror on the back wall she grunted a reply the truck driver gnawed down the stick of gum slowly opening his jaw and lip wide with each bite he shaped the gum in his mouth rolled it under his tongue while he walked to the big red truck the hitch hiker stood up and looked across through the window could ya give me a lift mister the driver looked quickly back at the restaurant for a sec ond didn you see the no rider sticker on the win shield sure i seen it but sometimes a guy ll be a good guy even if some rich bastard make him carry a sticker the driver getting slowly into the truck considered the part of this answer if he refused now not only wa he not a good guy but he wa forced to carry a sticker wa not allowed to have company if he took in the hitch hiker he wa automatically a good guy and also he wa not one whom any rich bastard could kick around he knew he wa being trapped but he couldn t see a way out and he wanted to be a good guy he glanced again at the restaurant scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend he said the hitch hiker flopped down out of sight and clung to the door handle the motor roared up for a moment the gear clicked in and the great truck moved away first gear e cond gear third gear and then a high whining pick up an the grape of wrath fourth gear under the clinging man the highway blurred dizzily by it wa a mile to the first turn in the road then the truck slowed down the hitch hiker stood up eased the door open and slipped into the seat the driver looked over at him slitting his eye and he chewed a though thought and impression were being sorted and arranged by his jaw before they were finally filed away in his brain his eye began at the new cap moved down the new clothes to the new shoe the hitch hiker squirmed his back against the seat in comfort took off his cap and swabbed his sweating forehead and chin with it thanks buddy he said my dog wa pooped out new shoe said the driver his voice had the same qual ity of secrecy and insinuation his eye had you oughtn to take no walk in new shoe hot weather the hiker looked down at the dusty yellow shoe didn t have no other

question of the driver had the tone of a subtle exam ination he seemed to spread net to set trap with his ques tions lookin for a job he asked no my old man got a place forty acre he s a cropper but we been there a long time the driver looked significantly at the field along the road where the com wa fallen sideways and the dust wa piled on it little flint shoved through the dusty soil the driver said a though to himself a forty acre cropper and he ain t been dusted out and he ain t been tractored out course i ain t heard lately said the hitch hiker the grape of wrath long time said the driver

the heated distance from his side pocket he brought out his tobacco and paper he rolled his cigarette down between his knee where the wind could not get at it the driver chewed a rhythmically a thoughtfully a a cow he waited to let the whole emphasis of the preceding passage disappear and be forgotten at last when the air seemed neutral again he said a guy that never been a truck skinner don

the long speech his secret eye turned on his passenger joad remained silent nervously the driver tried to force him into participation ever know a guy that said big word like that preacher said joad w ell it make you mad to hear a guy use big word course with a preacher it s all right because nobody would fool around with a preacher anyway but this guy wa funny you didn t give a damn when he said a

wrath ty joad took a quick drink from the flask he dragged the last smoke from his raveling cigarette and then with cal jused thumb and forefinger crushed out the glowing end he rubbed the butt to a pulp and put it out the window letting the breeze suck it from his finger the big tire sang a high note on the pavement joad s dark quiet eye became amused a he stared along the road the driver waited and glanced uneasily over at last joad s long upper lip grinned up from his teeth and he chuckled silently his chest jerked with the chuckle i you sure took a hell of a long time to o et to it buddy the driver did not look over get to what how do you mean joad s lip stretched tight over his long teeth for a mo ment and he licked his lip like a dog two lick one in each direction from the middle his voice became harsh you know what i mean you give me a goin over when i first got in i seen you the driver looked straight ahead gripped the wheel so tightly that the pad of his palm bulged and the back of his hand paled joad continued you know where i come from the driver wa silent don t you joad insisted well sure that is maybe but it ain t none of my busi ness i mind my own yard it ain t nothing to me the word tumbled out now i don t stick my nose in nobody s business and suddenly he wa silent and waiting and his hand were still white on the wheel a grasshopper flipped through the window and lighted on top of the instrument panel where it sat and began to scrape it wing with it angled jumping leg joad reached forward and crushed it hard skull like head with his finger and he let it into the wind stream out the window joad chuckled again while he the grape of wrath brushed the bit of broken insect from his fingertip you got me wrong mister he said i ain t keepin quiet about it sure i been in mcalester been there four year sure these is the clothes they give me when i come out i don t give a damn who know it an i m goin to my old man s place so i don t have to lie

at now look see that road up ahead yeah well i get off there sure i know you re wettin your pant to know what i done i ain t a guy to let you down the high hum of the motor dulled and the song of the tire dropped in pitch joad got out his pint and took another short drink the truck drifted to a stop where a dirt road opened at right angle to the highway joad got out and stood beside the cab window the vertical exhaust pipe puttered up it barely visible blue smoke joad leaned toward the driver homicide he said quickly that s a big word the grape of wrath mean i killed a guy seven year i m sprung in four for keepin my nose clean the driver s eye slipped over joad s face to memorize it i never asked you nothin about it he said i mind my own yard you can tell about it in every joint from here to texola he smiled so long fella you been a good guy but look when you been in stir a little while you can smell a question cornin from hell to breakfast you telegraphed yours the first time you opened your trap he spatted the metal door with the palm of his hand thanks for the lift he said so long he turned away and walked into the dirt road for a moment the driver stared after him and then he called luck joad waved his hand without looking around then the motor roared up and the gear clicked and the great red truck rolled heavily away chapter three rt he concrete highway wa edged with a mat of i tangled broken dry grass and the grass head were heavy with oat beard to catch on a dog s coat and foxtail to tangle in a horse s fetlock and clover burr to fasten in sheep s wool sleeping life waiting to be spread and dispersed every seed armed with an appliance of dispersal twisting dart and parachute for the wind little spear and ball of tiny thorn and all waiting for animal and for the wind for a man s trouser cuff or the hem of a woman s skirt all passive but armed with appliance of activity still but each possessed of the anlage of movement the sun lay on the grass and warmed it and in the shade under the grass the insect moved ant and ant lion to set trap for them grasshopper to jump into the air and flick their yellow wing for a second sow bug like little arma dillos plodding restlessly on many tender foot and over the grass at the roadside a land turtle crawled turning aside for nothing dragging his high domed shell over the grass his hard leg and yellow nailed foot threshed slowly through the grass not really walking but boosting and dragging his shell along the barley beard slid off his shell and the clover burr fell on him and rolled to the ground his horny beak wa partly open and his fierce humorous eye under brow like fingernail stared straight ahead he came over the grass leaving a beaten trail behind him and the hill which wa the the grape of wrath highway embankment reared up ahead of him for a mo ment he stopped his head held high he blinked and looked up and down at last he started to climb the embankment front clawed foot reached forward but did not touch the hind foot kicked his shell along and it scraped on the grass and on the gravel a the embankment grew steeper and steeper the more frantic were the effort of die land turtle pushing hind leg strained and slipped boosting the shell along and the horny head protruded a far a the neck could stretch little by little the shell slid up the embankment until at last a parapet cut straight across it line of march the shoulder of the road a concrete wall four inch high a though they worked independently the hind leg pushed the shell against the wall the head upraised and peered over the wall to the broad smooth plain of cement now the hand braced on top of the wall strained and lifted and the shell came slowly up and rested it front end on the wall for a moment the turtle rested a red ant ran into the shell into the soft skin inside the shell and suddenly head and leg snapped in and the armored tail clamped in sideways the red ant wa crushed between body and leg and one head of wild oat wa clamped into the shell by a front leg for a long moment the turtle lay still and then the neck crept out and the old humorous frowning eye looked about and the leg and tail came out the back leg went to work strain ing like elephant leg and the shell tipped to an angle so that the front leg could not reach the level cement plain but higher and higher the hind leg boosted it until at last the center of balance wa reached the front tipped down the front leg scratched at the pavement and it wa up but the head of wild oat wa held by it stem around the front leg now the going wa easy and all the leg worked and the the grape of wrath shell boosted along waggling from side to side a sedan driven by a forty year old woman approached she saw the turtle and swung to the right off the highway the wheel screamed and a cloud of dust boiled up two wheel lifted for a moment and then settled the car skidded back onto the road and went on but more slowly the turtle had jerked into it shell but now it hurried on for the highway wa burning hot and now a light truck approached and a it came near the driver saw the turtle and swerved to hit it his front wheel struck the edge of the shell flipped the turtle like a tiddly wink spun it like a coin and rolled it off the high way the truck went back to it course along the right side lying on it back the turtle wa tight in it shell for a long time but at last it leg waved in the air reaching for some thing to pull it over it front foot caught a piece of quartz and little by little the shell pulled over and flopped upright the wild oat head fell out and three of the spearhead seed stuck in the ground and a the turtle crawled on down the embankment it shell dragged dirt over the seed the turtle entered a dust road and jerked itself along drawing a wavy shallow trench in the dust with it shell the old humorous eye looked ahead and the horny beak opened a little his yellow toe nail slipped a fraction in the dust chapter four w hen joad heard the truck get under way gear climbing up to gear and the ground throb bing under the rubber beating of the tire he stopped and turned about and watched it until it disappeared when it wa out of sight he still watched the distance and the blue air shimmer thoughtfully he took the pint from his pocket unscrewed the metal cap and sipped the whisky deli cately running his tongue inside the bottle neck and then around his lip to gather in any flavor that might have e caped him he said experimentally there we spied a nig ger and that wa all he could remember at last he turned about and faced the dusty side road that cut off at right angle through the field the sun wa hot and no wind stirred the sifted dust the road wa cut with furrow where dust had slid and settled back into the wheel track joad took a few step and the flourlike dust spurted up in front of his new yellow shoe and the yellowness wa disappearing under gray dust he leaned down and untied the lace slipped off first one shoe and then the other and he worked his damp foot corn fortably in the hot dry dust until little spurt of it came up between his toe and until the skin on his foot tightened with dryness he took off his coat and wrapped his shoe in it and slipped the bundle under his arm and at last he moved up the road shooting the dust ahead of him making a cloud that hung low to the ground behind him the grape of wrath the right of way wa fenced two strand of barbed wire on willow pole the pole were crooked and badly trimmed whenever a crotch came to the proper height the wire lay in it and where there wa no crotch the barbed wire wa lashed to the post with rusty baling wire beyond the fence the com lay beaten down by wind and heat and drought and the cup where leaf joined stalk were filled with dust joad plodded along dragging his cloud of dust behind him a little bit ahead he saw the high domed shell of a land turtle crawling slowly along through the dust it leg working stiffly and jerkily joad stopped to watch it and his shadow t fell on the turtle instantly head and leg were withdrawn nd the short thick tail clamped sideways into the shell joad picked it up and turned it over the back wa brown gray like the dust but the underside of the shell wa creamy yellow clean and smooth joad shifted his bundle high tinder his arm and stroked the smooth undershell with his finger and he pressed it it wa softer than the back the hard old head came out and tried to look at the pressing finger and the leg waved wildly the turtle wetted on joad s hand and struggled uselessly in the air joad turned it back upright and rolled it up in his coat with his shoe he could feel it pressing and struggling and fussing under his arm he moved ahead more quickly now dragging his heel a little in the fine dust ahead of him beside the road a scrawny dusty willow tree cast a speckled shade joad could see it ahead of him it poor branch curving over the way it load of leaf tat tered and scraggly a a molting chicken joad wa sweating now his blue shirt darkened down his back and under his arm he pulled at the visor of his cap and creased it in the middle breaking it cardboard lining so completely that it the grape of wrath could never look new again and his step took on new speed and intent toward the shade of the distant willow tree at the willow he knew there would be shade at least one hard bar of absolute shade thrown by the trunk since the sun had passed it zenith the sun whipped the back of his neck now and made a little humming in his head he could not see the base of the tree for it grew out of a little swale that held water longer than the level place joad speeded his pace against the sun and he started down the declivity he slowed cautiously for the bar of absolute shade wa taken a man sat on the ground leaning against the trunk of the tree his leg were crossed and one bare foot extended nearly a high a his head he did not hear joad approaching for he wa whistling solemnly the tune of yes sir that s my baby his extended foot swung slowly up and down in the tempo it wa not dance tempo he stopped whistling and sang in an easy thin tenor t yes sir that s my saviour je sus is my saviour je sus is my saviour now on the level s not the devil jesus is my saviour now joad had moved into the imperfect shade of the molting leaf before the man heard him coming stopped his song and turned his head it wa a long head r b ony tight of skin and set on a neck a stringy and muscular a a celery stalk f his eyeball were heavy and protruding the lid stretched to cover them and the lid were raw and red his cheek were brown and shiny and hairless and his mouth full humorous or sensual the nose beaked and hard v stretched the grape of wrath the skin so tightly that the bridge showed white there wa no perspiration on the face not even on the tall pale forehead it wa an abnormally high forehead lined with delicate blue vein at the temple fully half of the face wa above the eye his stiff gray hair wa mussed back from his brow a though he had combed it back with his lingers for clothes he wore overall and a blue shirt a denim coat with brass button and a spotted brown hat creased like a pork pie lay on the ground beside him canvas sneaker gray with dust lay near by where they had fallen when they were kicked off the man looked long at joad the light seemed to go far into his brown eye and it picked out little golden speck deep in the iris the strained bundle of neck muscle stood out joad stood still in the speckled shade he took off his cap and mopped his wet face with it and dropped it and his rolled coat on the ground the man in the absolute shade uncrossed his leg and dug vvith his toe at the earth joad said hi it s hotter n hell on the road the seated man stared questioningly at him now ain t you young tom joad ol tom s boy yeah said joad all the way coin home now you wouldn remember me i guess the man said he smiled and his full lip revealed great horse teeth oh no you wouldn t remember you wa always too busy pullin little girl pigtail when i give you the holy sperit you wa all wropped up in yankin that pigtail out by the root you maybe don t recollect but i do the two of you come to jesus at once cause of that pigtail yankin baptized both of the grape of wrath you in the irrigation ditch at once fightin an yellin like a couple a cat joad looked at him with drooped eye and then he laughed why you re the preacher you re the preacher i jus passed a recollection about you to a guy not an hour ago i wa a preacher said the man seriously reverend jim casy wa a burning busher used to howl out the name of jesus to glory and used to get an irrigation ditch so squirm in full of repented sinner half of em like to drownded but not no more he sighed just jim casy now ain t got the call no more got a lot of sinful idears but they seem kinda sensible joad said you re bound to get idears if you go thinkin about stuff sure i remember you you use ta give a good meetin i recollect one time you give a whole sermon walkin around on your hand yellin your head off ma favored you more than anybody an granma say you wa just lousy with the spirit joad dug at his rolled coat and found the pocket and brought out his pint the turtle moved a leg but he wrapped it up tightly he unscrewed the cap and held out the bottle have a little snort casy took the bottle and regarded it broodingly i ain t preachin no more much the sperit ain t in the people much no more and worse n that the sperit ain t in me no more course now an again the sperit get movin an i rip out a meetin or when folk set out food i give em a grace but my heart ain t in it i on y do it cause they expect it joad mopped his face with his cap again you ain t too damn holy to take a drink are you he asked casy seemed to see the bottle for the first time he tilted the grape of wrath it and took three big swallow nice drinkin liquor he said ought to be said joad that s fact ry liquor cost a buck casy took another swallow before he passed the bottle back yes sir he said yes sir joad took the bottle from him and in politeness did not wipe the neck with his sleeve before he drank he squatted on his ham and set the bottle upright against his coat roll his finger found a twig with which to draw his thought on the ground he swept the leaf from a square and smoothed the dust and he drew angle and made little cir cles i ain t seen you in a long time he said nobody seen me said the preacher i went off alone an i sat and figured the sperit s strong in me on y it ain t the same i ain t so sure of a lot of thing he sat up straighter against the tree his bony hand dug it way like a squirrel into his overall pocket brought out a black bitten plug of tobacco carefully he brushed off bit of straw and gray pocket fuzz before he bit off a comer and settled the quid into his cheek joad waved his stick in negation when the plug wa held out to him the turtle dug at the rolled coat casy looked over at the stirring garment what you got there a chicken you ll smother it joad rolled the coat up more tightly an old turtle he said picked him up on the road an old bulldozer thought i d take im to my little brother kid like turtle the preacher nodded his head slowly every kid got a turtle some time or other nobody can t keep a turtle though they work at it and work at it and at last one day they get out and away they go off somewhere it s like me i wouldn take the good ol gospel that wa just layin there the grape of wrath to my hand i got to be pickin at it an workin at it until i got it all tore down here i got the sperit sometimes an nothin to preach about i got the call to lead people an no place to lead em lead em around and around said joad sling em in the irrigation ditch tell em they ll bum in hell if they don t think like you what the hell you want to lead em some place for jus lead em the straight trunk shade had stretched out along the ground joad moved gratefully into it and squatted on his ham and made a new smooth place on which to draw his thought with a stick a thick furred yel low shepherd dog came trotting down the road head low tongue lolling and dripping it tail hung limply curled and it panted loudly joad whistled at it but it only dropped it head an inch and trotted fast toward some definite destina tion coin someplace joad explained a little piqued coin for home maybe the preacher could not be thrown from his subject u goin someplace he repeated that s right he s goin someplace me i don t know where i m goin tell you what i used ta get the people jumpin an talkin in tongue an glory shoutin till they just fell down an passed out an some i d baptize to bring em to an then you know what i d do i d take one of them girl out in the grass an i d lay with her done it ever time then i d feel bad an i d pray an pray but it didn t do no good come the nex time them an me wa full of the sperit i d do it again i figgered there just wasn t no hope for me an i wa a damned o y hypocrite but i didn t mean to be joad smiled and his long teeth parted and he licked his lip there ain t nothing like a good hot meetin for pushin f em over he said i done that myself the grape of wrath casy leaned forward excitedly you see he cried i seen it wa that way an i started thinkin he waved his bony big knuckled hand up and down in a patting gesture i got to thinkin like this here s me preachin grace an here s them people gettin grace so hard they re jumpin an shoutin now they say layin up with a girl come from the devil but the more grace a girl got in her the quicker she want to go out in the grass an i got to thinkin how in hell s cuse me how can the devil get in when a girl is so full of the holy sperit that it s spoutin out of her nose an ear you d think that d be one time when the devil didn t stand a snowball s chance in hell but there it wa his eye were shining with excitement he worked his cheek for a mo ment and then spat into the dust and the gob of spit rolled over and over picking up dust until it looked like a round dry little pellet the preacher spread out his hand and looked at his palm a though he were reading a book an there s me he went on softly there s me with all them people s soul in my han responsible an feelin my responsibility an ever time i lay with one of them girl he looked over at joad and his face looked helpless his expression asked for help joad carefully drew the torso of a woman in the dirt breast hip pelvis i wasn t never a preacher he said i never let nothin get by when i could catch it an i never had no idears about it except i wa goddamn glad when i got one but you wasn t a preacher casy insisted a girl wa just a girl to you they wasn t nothin to you but to me they wa holy vessel i wa savin their soul an here with all that responsibility on me i d just get em frothin with the holy sperit an then i d take em out in the grass the grape of wrath maybe i should of been a preacher said joad he brought out his tobacco and paper and rolled a cigarette he lighted it and squinted through the smoke at the preacher been a long time without a girl he said it s gon na take ome catchin up casy continued it worried me till i couldn t get no sleep here fd go to preachin and fd say by

an went off by myself an give her a damn good thinkin about he doubled up his leg and scratched between his dry dusty toe i say to myself what s gnawin you is it the screwin an i say no it s the sin an i say why is it that when a fella ought to be just about mule as proof against sin an all full up of jesus why is it that s the time a fella get fingerin his pant button he laid two finger down in his palm in rhythm a though he gently placed each word there side by side i say maybe it ain t a sin maybe it s just the way folk is maybe we been whippin the hell out of ourselves for nothin an i thought how some sister took to bearin theirselves with a three foot shag of bobwire an i thought how maybe they liked to hurt themselves an maybe i liked to hurt myself well i wa lay in under a tree when i figured that out and i went to sleep and it come night an it wa dark when i come to they wa a coyote squawkin near by before i knowed it i wa sayin out loud the hell with it vt i f a m h ramhrag ihe grape of wrath there ain t no sin and there ain t no virtue there s just stuff people do it s all part of the same thing and some of the thing folk do is nice and some ain t nice but that s a far a any man got a right to say he paused and looked up from the palm of his hand where he had laid down the word joad wa grinning at him but joad s eye were sharp and interested too you give her a goin over he said you figured her out casy spoke again and his voice rang with pain and con fusion i say what s this call this spent an i say it s love i love people so much i m fit to bust

maybe that s the holy sperit the human sperit the whole shebang maybe all men got one big soul ever body s a part of now i sat there thinkin it an all of a suddent i knew it i knew it so deep down that it wa true and i still know it joad s eye dropped to the ground a though he could not meet the naked honesty in the preacher s eye you can t hold no church with idears like that he said people would drive you out of the country with idears like that jumpin an yellin that s what folk like make em feel swell when granma got to talkin in tongue you couldn t tie her down she could knock over a

think hard joad picked up the bottle and took a swig they wasn t nothing in it good or bad i just had fun he handed the flask to the preacher he sighed and drank and looked at the low level of the whisky and took another tiny drink that s good he said the grape of wrath k i got to worryin about whether in messin around maybe i done somebody a hurt joad looked over toward his coat and saw the turtle free of the cloth and hurrying away in the direction he had been following when joad found him joad watched him for a moment and then got slowly to his foot and retrieved him and wrapped him in the coat again i ain t got no present for the kid he said nothin but this ok turtle it s a funny thing the preacher said i wa thimkln about of tom joad when you come along thinkin i d call in on him i

dusty afternoon light put a golden color on the land the cornstalk looked golden a flight of swal low swooped overhead toward some waterhole the turtle in joad s coat began a new campaign of escape joad creased the visor of his cap it wa getting the long protruding curve of a crow s beak now guess i ll mosey along he said i hate to hit the sun but it ain t so bad now casy pulled himself together

joad pa ll be glad to see you he always said you got too long a pecker for a preacher he the grape of wrath picked up his coat roll and tightened it snugly about his shoe and turtle casy gathered in his canvas sneaker and shoved his bare foot into them i ain t got your confidence he said fir always scared there s wire or glass under the dust i don t know nothin hate so much a a cut toe they hesitated on the edge of the shade and then they plunged into the yellow sunlight like two swimmer hasten ing to get to shore after a few fast step they slowed to a gentle thoughtful pace the cornstalk threw gray shadow sideways now and the raw smell of hot dust wa in the air the com field ended and dark green cotton took it place dark green leaf through a film of dust and the boll form ing it wa spotty cotton thick in the low place where water had stood and bare on the high place the plant strove against the sun and distance toward the horizon wa tan to invisibility the dust road stretched out ahead of them waving up and down the willow of a stream lined across the west and to the northwest a fallow section wa going back to sparse brush but the smell of burned dust wa in the air and the air wa dry so that mucus in the nose dried to a crust and the eye watered to keep the eyeball from drying out casy said see how good the corn come along until the dust got up been a dinger of a crop ever year said joad ever year i can remember we had a good crop cornin an it never come grampa say she wa good the first five plowin s while the wild grass wa still in her the road dropped down a little hill and climbed up another rolling hill casy said of tom s house can t be more n a mile from here ain t she over that third rise the grape of wrath sure said joad less somebody stole it like pa stole it your pa stole it sure got it a mile an a half east of here an drug it wa a family livin there an they moved away grampa an pa an my brother noah like to took the whole house but she wouldn come they only got part of her that s why she look so funny on one end they cut her in two an drug her over with twelve head of horse and two mule they wa goin back for the other half an stick her together again but before they got there wink manley come with his boy and stole the other half pa an grampa wa pretty sore but a little later them an wink got drunk together an laughed their head

wa friend got drunk together ever chance they got tom s a great one casy agreed they plodded dustily on down to the bottom of the draw and then slowed their step for the rise casy wiped his forehead with his sleeve and put on his flat topped hat again yes he repeated tom wa a great one for a godless man he wa a great one i seen him in meetin sometimes when the sperit got into him just a little an i seen him take ten twelve foot jump i tell you when o y tom got a dose of the holy sperit you got to move fast to keep from gettin run down an tromped jumpy a a stud horse in a box stall they topped the next rise and the road dropped into an old water cut ugly and raw a ragged course and freshet scar cutting into it from both side a few stone were in the grape of wrath the crossing joad minced across in his bare foot yon talk about pa he said maybe you never seen uncle john the time they baptized him over to polk s place why he got to plungin an jumpin jumped over a feeny bush a big a a piana over he d jump an back he d jump howlin like a dog wolf in moon time well pa seen him an pa he flggers he s the be jesus jumper in these part so pa pick out a feeny bush bout twicet a big a uncle john s feeny bush and pa let out a squawk like a sow litterin broken bottle an he take a run at that feeny bush an clear her an bust his right leg that took the sperit out of pa preacher want to pray it set but pa say no by god he d got his heart full of havin a doctor well they wasn t a doctor but they wa a travelin dentist an he set her preacher give her a prayin over anyways they plodded up the little rise on the other side of the water cut now that the sun wa on the wane some of it im pact wa gone and while the air wa hot the hammering ray were weaker the strung wire on crooked pole still edged the road on the right hand side a line of wire fence strung out across the cotton field and the dusty green cotton wa the same on both side dusty and dry and dark green joad pointed to the boundary fence that there s our line we didn t really need no fence there but we had the wire an pa kinda liked her there said it give him a feelin that forty wa forty wouldn t of had the fence if uncle john didn come drivin in one night with six spool of wire in his wagon he give em to pa for a shoat we never did know where he got that wire they slowed for the rise moving their foot in the deep soft dust feeling the earth with their foot joad s eye were inward on his memory he i he grape of wrath seemed to be laughing inside himself uncle john wa a crazy bastard he said like what he done with that shoat he chuckled and walked on jim casy waited impatiently the story did not continue casy gave it a good long time to come out well what d he do with that shoat he demanded at last with some irri tation huh oh well he killed that shoat right there an he got ma to light up the stove he cut out pork chop an put em in the pan an he put rib an a leg in the oven he et chop till the rib wa done an he et rib till the leg wa done an then he tore into that leg cut off big hunk of her an shoved em in his mouth u kid hung around slaverin an he give u some but he wouldn give pa none by

spoke it to you but i don t do that no more what you s pose he done a thing like that for i dunno said joad he jus got hungry for pork the grape of wrath make me hungry jus to think of it i had jus four slice of roastin pork in four year one slice ever christmus casy suggested elaborately maybe tom ll kill the fatted calf like for the prodigal in scripture joad laughed scornfully you don t know pa if he kill a chicken most of the squawkin will come from pa not the chicken he don t never learn he s always savin a pig for christmus and then it dy in september of bloat or somepin so you can t eat it when uncle john wanted pork he et pork he had her they moved over the curving top of the hill and saw the joad place below them and joad stopped it ain t the same he said looka that house somepin s happened they ain t nobody there the two stood and stared at tb little cluster of building s chapter five t he owner of the land came onto the land or more often a spokesman for the owner came they came in closed car and they felt the dry earth with their finger and sometimes they drove big earth auger into the ground for soil test the tenant from their sun beaten dooryard watched uneasily when the closed car drove along the field and at last the owner men drove into the dooryard and sat in their car to talk out of the window the tenant men stood beside the car for a while and then squatted on their ham and found stick with which to mark the dust in the open door the woman stood looking out and be hind them the child corn headed child with wide eye one bare foot on top of the other bare foot and the toe working the woman and the child watched their men talking to the owner men they were silent some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold and all of them were caught in some thing larger than themselves some of them hated the mathe matics that drove them and some were afraid and some worshiped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from thought and from feeling if a bank or a finance com the grape of wrath pany owned the land the owner man said the bank the company need want insists must have a though the bank or the company were a monster with thought and feeling which had ensnared them these last would take no responsibility for the bank or the company because they were men and slave while the bank were machine and master all at the same time some of the owner men were a little proud to be slave to such cold and powerful master the owner men sat in the car and explained you know the land is poor you ve scrabbled at it long enough god know the squatting tenant men nodded and wondered and drew figure in the dust and yes they knew god know if the dust only wouldn t fly if the top would only stay on the soil it might not be so bad the owner men went on leading to their point you know the land s getting poorer you know what cotton doe to the land robs it suck all the blood out of it the squatter nodded they knew god knew if they could only rotate the crop they might pump blood back into the land well it s too late and the owner men explained the work ings and the thinking of the monster that wa stronger than they were a man can hold land if he can just eat and pay tax he can do that yes he can do that until his crop fail one day and he ha to borrow money from the bank but you see a bank or a company can t do that because those creature don t breathe air don t eat side meat they breathe profit they eat the interest on money if they don t get it they die the way you die without air without side meat it is a sad thing but it is so it is just so the squatting men raised their eye to understand can the grape of wrath we just hang on maybe the next year will be a good year god know how much cotton next year and with all the war god know what price cotton will bring don t they make explosive out of cotton and uniform get enough war and cotton ll hit the ceiling next year maybe they looked up questioningly we can t depend on it the bank the monster ha to have profit all the time it can t wait it ll die no tax go on when the monster stop growing it dy it can t stay one size soft finger began to tap the sill of the car window and hard finger tightened on the restless drawing stick in the doorway of the sun beaten tenant house woman sighed and then shifted foot so that the one that had been down wa now on top and the toe working dog came sniffing near the owner car and wetted on all four tire one after another and chicken lay in the sunny dust and fluffed their feath er to get the cleansing dust down to the skin in the little sty the pig grunted inquiringly over the muddy remnant of the slop the squatting men looked down again what do you want u to do we can t take less share of the crop we re half starved now the kid are hungry all the time we got no clothes torn an ragged if all the neighbor weren t the same we d be ashamed to go to meeting and at last the owner men came to the point the tenant system won t work any more one man on a tractor can take the place of twelve or fourteen family pay him a wage and take all the crop we have to do it we don t like to do it but the monster s sick something s happened to the monster but you ll kill the land with cotton the grape of wrath we know we ve got to take cotton quick before the land dy then well sell the land lot of family in the east would like to own a piece of land the tenant men looked up alarmed but what ll happen to u how ll we eat you ll have to get off the land the plow ll go through the dooryard and now the squatting men stood up angrily gramp took up the land and he had to kill the indian and drive them away and pa wa born here and he killed weed and snake then a bad year came and he had to borrow a little money an we wa bom here there in the door our chil dren bom here and pa had to borrow money the bank owned the land then but we stayed and we got a little bit f what we raised we know that all that it s not u it s the bank a bank isn t like a man or an owner with fifty thousand acre he isn t like a man either that s the monster sure cried the tenant men but it s our land we measured it and broke it up we were born on it and we got killed on it died on it even if it s no good it s still ours that s what make it ours being bom on it working it dying on it that make ownership not a paper with number on it we re sorry it s not u it s the monster the bank isn t like a man yes but the bank is only made of men no you re wrong there quite wrong there the bank is something else than men it happens that every man in a bank hate what the bank doe and yet the bank doe it the bank is something more than men i tell you it s the monster men made it but they can t control it the tenant cried grampa killed indian pa killed snake the grape of wrath for the land maybe we can kill bank they re worse than indian and snake maybe we got to fight to keep our land like pa and grampa did and now the owner men grew angry you ll have to go but it s ours the tenant men cried we no the bank the monster owns it you ll have to go we ll get our gun like grampa when the indian came what then well first the sheriff and then the troop you ll be steal ing if you try to stay you ll be murderer if you kill to stay the monster isn t men but it can make men do what it want but if we go where ll we go how ll we go we got no money we re sorry said the owner men the bank the fifty thousand acre owner can t be responsible you re on land that isn t yours once over the line maybe you can pick cot ton in the fall maybe you can go on relief why don t you go on west to california there s work there and it never get cold why you can reach out anywhere and pick an orange why there s always some kind of crop to work in why don t you go there and the owner men started their car and rolled away the tenant men squatted down on their ham again to mark the dust with a stick to figure to wonder their sun burned face were dark and their sun whipped eye were light the woman moved cautiously out of the doorway toward their men and the child crept behind the woman cautiously ready to run the bigger boy squatted beside heir father because that made them men after a time the vomen asked what did he want and the men looked up for a second and the smolder of the grape of wrath pain wa in their eye we got to get off a tractor and a superintendent like factory where ll we go the woman asked we don t know we don t know and the woman went quickly quietly back into the house and herded the child ahead of them they knew that a man so hurt and so perplexed may turn in anger even on people he love they left the men alone to figure and to wonder in the dust after a time perhaps the tenant man looked about at the pump put in ten year ago with a goose neck handle and iron flower on the spout at the chopping block where a thousand chicken had been killed at the hand plow lying in the shed and the patent crib hanging in the rafter over it the child crowded about the woman in the house what we going to do ma where we going to go the woman said we don t know yet go out and play but don t go near your father he might whale you if you go near him and the woman went on with the work but all the time they watched the men squatting in the dust per plexed and figuring the tractor came over the road and into the field great crawler moving like insect having the incredible strength of insect they crawled over the ground laying the track and rolling on it and picking it up diesel tractor puttering while they stood idle they thundered when they moved and then settled down to a droning roar snub nosed monster raising the dust and sticking their snout into it straight down the country across the country through fence through dooryard in and out of gully in straight line they did not run on the ground but on their own roadbed the grape of wrath they ignored hill and gulch water course fence house the man sitting in the iron seat did not look like a man gloved goggled rubber dust mask over nose and mouth he wa a part of the monster a robot in the seat the thunder of the cylinder sounded through the country became one with the air and the earth so that earth and air muttered in sympathetic vibration the driver could not control it straight across country it went cutting through a dozen farm and straight back a twitch at the control could swerve the cad but the driver s hand could not twitch be cause the monster that built the tractor the monster that sent the tractor out had somehow got into the driver s hand into his brain and muscle had goggled him and muzzled him goggled his mind muzzled his speech goggled his percep tion muzzled his protest he could not see the land a it wa he could not smell the land a it smelled his foot did not stamp the clod or feel the warmth and power of the earth he sat in an iron seat and stepped on iron pedal he could not cheer or beat or curse or encourage the extension of his power and because of this he could not cheer or whip or curse or encourage himself he did not know or own or trust or beseech the land if a seed dropped did not germinate it wa nothing if the young thrusting plant withered in drought or drowned in a flood of rain it wa no more to the driver than to the tractor he loved the land no more than the bank loved the land he could admire the tractor it machined surface it surge of power the roar of it detonating cylinder but it wa not his tractor behind the tractor rolled the shining disk cut ting the earth with blade not plowing but surgery pushing the cut earth to the right where the second row of disk cut tthe grape of wrath it and pushed it to the left slicing blade shining polished by the cut earth and pulled behind die disk the harrow combing with iron teeth so that the little clod broke up and the earth lay smooth behind the harrow the long seeder twelve curved iron penis erected in the foundry or gasms set by gear raping methodically raping without pa sion the driver sat in his iron seat and he wa proud of the straight line he did not will proud of the tractor he did not own or love proud of the power he could not control and when that crop grew and wa harvested no man had crum bled a hot clod in his finger and let the earth sift past his fingertip no man had touched the seed or lusted for the growth men ate what they had not raised had no connection with the bread the land bore under iron and under iron gradually died for it wa not loved or hated it had no prayer or curse at noon the tractor driver stopped sometimes near a ten ant house and opened his lunch sandwich wrapped in waxed paper white bread pickle cheese spam a piece of pie branded like an engine part he ate without relish and tenant not yet moved away came out to see him looked curiously while the goggles were taken off and the rubber dust mask leaving white circle around the eye and a large white circle around nose and mouth the exhaust of the tractor puttered on for fuel is so cheap it is more efficient to leave the engine running than to heat the diesel nose for a new start curious child crowded close ragged child who ate their fried dough a they watched they watched hungrily the unwrapping of the sandwich and their hun ger sharpened nose smelled the pickle cheese and spam they didn t speak to the driver they watched his hand an the grape of wrath it carried food to his mouth they did not watch him chew ing their eye followed the hand that held the sandwich after a while the tenant who could not leave the place came out and squatted in the shade besid the tractor why you re joe davis s boy sure the driver said well what you doing this kind of work for against your own people three dollar a day i got damn sick of creeping for my dinner and not getting it i got a wife and kid we got to eat three dollar a day and it come every day that s right the tenant said but for your three dollar a day fifteen or twenty family can t eat at all nearly a hun dred people have to go out and wander on the road for your three dollar a day is that right and the driver said can t think of that got to think of my own kid three dollar a day and it come every day time are changing mister don t you know can t make a living on the land unless you ve got two five ten thousand acre and a tractor crop land isn t for little guy like u any more you don t kick up a howl because you can t make ford or because you re not the telephone company well crop are like that now nothing to do about it you try to get three dollar a day someplace that s the only way the tenant pondered funny thing how it is if a man owns a little property that property is him it s part of him and it s like him if he owns property only so he can walk on it and handle it and be sad when it isn t doing well and feel fine when the rain fall on it that property is him and some way he s bigger because he owns it even if he isn t success ful he s big with his property that is so and the tenant pondered more but let a man get prop the grape of wrath erty he doesn t see or can t take time to get his finger in or can t be there to walk on it why then the property is the man he can t do what he want he can t think what he want the property is the man stronger than he is and he is small not big only his possession are big and he s the servant of his property that is so too the driver munched the branded pie and threw the crust away time are changed don t you know thinking about stuff like that don t feed the kid get your three dollar a day feed your kid you got no call to worry about any body s kid but your own you get a reputation for talking like that and you ll never get three dollar a day big shot won t give you three dollar a day if you worry about any thing but your three dollar a day nearly a hundred people on the road for your three dollar where will we go and that reminds me the driver said you better ge i out soon i m going through the dooryard after dinner you filled in the well this morning i know had to keep the line straight but i m going through the dooryard after dinner got to keep the line straight and well you know joe davis my old man so i ll tell you this i got order wherever there s a family not moved out if i have an accident you know get too close and cave the house in a little well might get a couple of dollar and my youngest kid never had no shoe yet i built it with my hand straightened old nail to put y the sheathing on rafter are wired to the stringer with bal ing wire it s mine i built it you bump it down i ll be in the window with a rifle you even come too close and fi pot you like a rabbit it s not me there s nothing i can do i ll lose my job if i the grape of wrath don t do it and look suppose you kill me they ll just hang you but long before you re hung there ll be another guy on the tractor and he ll bump the house down you re not killing the right guy that s so the tenant said who gave you order i ll go after him he s the one to kill you re wrong he got his order from the bank the bank told him clear those people out or it s your job well there s a president of the bank there s a board of director i ll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank the driver said fellow wa telling me the bank get order from the east the order were make the land show profit or we ll close you up but where doe it stop who can we shoot i don t aim to starve to death before i kill the man that s starving me i don t know maybe there s nobody to shoot maybe the thing isn t men at all maybe like you said the property s doing it anyway i told you my order i got to figure the tenant said we all got to figure there s some way to stop this it s not like lightning or earth quake we ve got a bad thing made by men and by god that s something we can change the tenant sat in his door way and the driver thundered his engine and started off track falling and curving harrow combing and the phallus of the seeder slipping into the ground across the dooryard the tractor cut and the hard foot beaten ground wa seeded field and the tractor cut through again the uncut spacs wa ten foot wide and back he came the iron guard bit into the house corner crumbled the wall and wrenched the little house from it foundation so that it fell sideways crushed like a bug and the driver wa goggled and a rub the grape of wrath ber mask covered his nose and mouth the tractor cut a straight line on and the air and the ground vibrated with it thunder the tenant man stared after it his rifle in his hand his wife wa beside him and the quiet child behind and all of them stared after the tractor chapter six t he reverend casy and young tom stood on the hill and looked down on the joad place the small unpainted house wa mashed at one comer and it had been pushed off it foundation so that it slumped at an angle it blind front window pointing at a spot of sky well above the horizon the fence were gone and the cotton grew in the dooryard and up against the house and the cot ton wa about the shed bam the outhouse lay on it side and the cotton grew close against it where the dooryard had been pounded hard by the bare foot of child and by stamping horse hoof and by the broad wagon wheel it wa cultivated now and the dark green dusty cotton grew young tom stared for a long time at the ragged wil low beside the dry horse trough at the concrete base where the pump had been jesus he said at last hell musta popped here there ain t nobody livin there at last he moved quickly down the hill and casy followed him he looked into the bam shed deserted a little ground straw on the floor and at the mule stall in the corner and a he looked in there wa a skittering on the floor and a family of mouse faded in under the straw joad paused at the entrance to the tool shed leanto and no tool were there a broken plow point a mess of hay wire in the comer an iron wheel from a hayrake and a rat gnawed mule collar a flat gallon oil can the grape of wrath trusted with dirt and oil and a pair of torn overall hang ing on a nail there ain t nothin left said joad we had pretty nice tool there ain t nothin left casy said if i wa still a preacher i d say the arm of the lord had struck but now i don t know what happened i been away i didn t hear nothin they walked toward the concrete well cap walked through cotton plant to get to it and the boll were forming on the cotton and the land wa cultivated we never planted here joad said we always kept this clear why you can t get a horse in now without he tromps the cotton they paused at the dry watering trough and the proper weed that should grow under a trough were gone and the old thick wood of the trough wa dry nd cracked on the well cap the bolt that had held the pump stuck up their thread rusty and the nut gone joad looked into the tube of the well and spat and listened he dropped a clod down the well and listened she wa a good well he said i can t hear water he seemed reluctant to go to the house he dropped clod after clod down the well maybe they re all dead he said but somebody d a told me fd a got word some way maybe they left a letter or something to tell in the house would they of knowed you wa cornin out i don know said joad no i guess not i didn know myself till a week ago le s look in the house she s all pushed out a shape some thing knocked the hell out of her they walked slowly toward the sagging house two of the support of the porch roof were pushed out so that the roof flopped down on one end and the house corner wa crushed in through a maze of splintered wood the room at the corner wa visible the the grape of wrath front door king open inward and a low strong gate across the front door hung outward on leather hinge joad stopped at the step a twelve by twelve timber doorstep s here he said but they re gone or ma s dead he pointed to the low gate across the front door if ma wa anywheres about that gate d be shut an hooked that s one thing she always done seen that gate wa shut his eye were warm ever since the pig got in over to jacob an et the baby milly jacob

lef that pig gate open less she wa in the house herself never did forget no they re gone or dead he climbed to the split porch and looked into the kitchen the window were broken out and throwing rock lay on the floor and the floor and wall sagged steeply away from the door and the sifted dust wa on the board joad pointed to the broken glass and the rock kid he said they ll go twenty mile to bust a window i done it myself they know when a house is empty they know that s the fust thing kid do when folk move out the kitchen wa empty of furniture stove gone and the round stovepipe hole in the wall showing light on the sink shelf lay an old beer opener and a broken fork with it wooden handle gone joad slipped cautiously into the room and the floor groaned under his weight an old copy of the philadelphia ledger wa on the floor against the wall it page yellow and curling joad looked into the bedroom no bed no chair nothing on the wall a picture of an indian girl in color labeled red wing a bed slat lean ing against the wall and in one comer a woman s high but ton shoe curled up at the toe and broken over the instep the grape of wrath joad picked it up and looked at it i remember this he said this wa ma s it s all wore out now ma liked them shoe had em for year no they ve went an took ever thing the sun had lowered until it came through the angled end window now and it flashed on the edge of the broken glass joad turned at last and went out and crossed the porch he sat down on the edge of it and rested his bare foot on the twelve by twelve step the evening light wa on the field and the cotton plant threw long shadow on the ground and the molting willow tree threw a long shadow casy sat down beside joad they never wrote you nothin he asked no like i said they wasn t people to write pa could write but he wouldn didn t like to it give him the shiver lo write he could work out a catalogue order a good a the hex fella but he wouldn write no letter just for duck they sat side by side staring off into the distance joad laid m rolled coat on the porch beside him his independent hand rolled a cigarette smoothed it and lighted it and he inhaled deeply and blew the smoke out through his nose somepin s wrong he said i can t put my finger on her i got an itch that somepin s wronger n hell just this house pushed aroun an my folk gone casy said right over there the ditch wa

toward the horizon and the dusty air wa red o the grape of wrath and golden the cat reached out a gray questioning paw and touched joad s coat he looked around hell i forgot the turtle ain t gon na pack it all over hell he unwrapped the land turtle and pushed it under the house but in a moment it wa out headed southwest a it had teen from the first the cat leaped at it and struck at it straining head and slashed at it moving foot the old hard mimorous head wa pulled in and the thick tail slapped in under the shell and when the cat grew tired of waiting for it and walked off the turtle headed on southwest again young tom joad and the preacher watched the turtle go waving it leg and boosting it heavy high domed shell along toward the southwest the cat crept along behind for a while but in a dozen yard it arched it back to a strong taut bow and yawned and came stealthily back toward the seated men where the hell you s pose he s goin said joad i seen turtle all my life they re always goin someplace they always seem to want to get there the gray cat seated itself between and behind them again it blinked slowly the skin over it shoulder jerked forward under a flea and then slipped slowly back the cat lifted a paw and inspected it flicked it claw out and in again experimentally and licked it pad with a shell pink tongue the red sun touched the horizon and spread out like a jellyfish and the sky above it seemed much brighter and more alive than it had been joad unrolled his new yellow shoe from his coat and he brushed his dusty foot with his hand before he slipped them on the preacher staring off across the field said some body s cornin look down there right through the cot ton joad looked where casy s finger pointed cornin afoot the grape of wrath he said can t see im for

sharply the gray cat came out of the bam shed and trotted miaowing toward the fire but nearly there it turned and went directly to one of the little pile of rabbit entrails on the ground it chewed and swal lowed and the entrails hung from it mouth casy sat on the ground beside the fire feeding it broken piece of board pushing the long board in a the flame ate off their end the evening bat flashed into the firelight and out again the cat crouched back and licked it lip and washed it face and whisker joad held up his rabbit laden wire between his two hand and walked to the fire here take one end muley wrap your end around that stake that s good now let s tighten her up we ought to wait till the fire s burned down but i can t wait he made the wire taut then found a stick and slipped the piece of meat along the wire until they were over the fire and the flame licked up around the meat and hardened and glazed the surface joad sat down by the fire but with his stick he moved and turned the rabbit so that it would not become sealed to the wire this here is a party he said salt muley s got an water an rabbit i wish he got a pot of hominy in his pocket that s all i wish muley said over the

quarter moon wa insubstantial and thin tom joad jl and the preacher walked quickly along a road that wa only wheel track and beaten caterpillar track through a cotton field only the unbalanced sky

said i d hate to have the dawn come and u be way to hell an gone somewhere the cotton field scurried with waking life the quick flutter of morning bird feeding on the ground the scamper over the clod

night sometimes an we imowed he come cause jus a sure a he come there d be a pack a gum in the bed right beside ever one of u we thought he wa j esus christ awmighty the preacher walked along head down he didn t answer and the light of the coming morning made his forehead seem to shine and his hand swinging beside him flicked into the light and out again tom wa silent too a though he had said too intimate a thing and wa ashamed he quickened his pace and the preacher kept step they could see a little into gray distance ahead now a snake wriggled slowly from the cotton row into the road tom stopped short of it and peered gopher snake he said let him go they walked around the snake and went on their way a little color came into the eastern sky and almost immediately the lonely dawn light crept over the land green appeared on the cotton plant and the earth wa grav brown the face of the men lost their gray ish shine joad s face seemed to darken with the growing light this is the good time joad said softly when i wa a kid i used to get up an walk around by myself when it wa like this what s that ahead a committee of dog had met in the road in honor of a bitch five male shepherd mongrel collie mongrel dog whose breed had been blurred by a freedom of social life were engaged in complimenting the bitch for each dog sniffed daintily and then stalked to a cotton plant on stiff leg raised a hind foot ceremoniously and wetted then went the grape of wrath back to smell joad and the preacher stopped to watch and suddenly joad laughed joyously by god he said by god now all dog met and hackle rose and they all growled and stood stiffly each waiting for the others to start a fight one dog mounted and now that it wa accom plished the others gave way and watched with interest and their tongue were out and their tongue dripped the two men walked on by god joad said i think that up dog is our flash i thought he d be dead come flash he laughed again what the hell if somebody called me wouldn t hear him neither mind me of a story they tell about willy feeley when he wa a young fella willy wa bashful awful bashful well one day he take a heifer over to graf bull ever body wa

tell story when i wa there or if they did i couldn laugh an i couldn cuss now i cuss all i want any time i want an it doe a fella good to cuss if he want to a redness grew up out of the eastern horizon and on the ground bird began to chirp sharply look said joad right ahead that s uncle john s tank can t see the win mill but there s his tank see it against the sky he speeded his walk i wonder if all the folk are there the the grape of wrath hulk of the tank stood above a rise joad hurrying raised a cloud of dust about his knee i wonder if ma they saw the tank leg now and the house a square little box un painted and bare and the bam low roofed and huddled smoke wa rising from the tin chimney of the house in the yard wa a litter piled furniture the blade and motor of the windmill bedstead chair table holy christ they re fixin to go joad said a truck stood in the yard a truck with high side but a strange truck for while the front of it wa a sedan the top had been cut off in the middle and the truck bed fitted on and a they drew near the men could hear pounding from the yard and a the rim of the blinding sun came up over the horizon it fell on the truck and they saw a man and the flash of his hammer a it rose and fell and the sun flashed on the window of the house the weathered board were bright two red chicken on the ground flamed with reflected light don t yell said tom let s creep up on em like and he walked so fast that the dust rose a high a his waist and then he came to the edge of the cotton field now they were in the yard proper earth beaten hard shiny hard and a few dusty crawling weed on the ground and joad slowed a though he feared to go on the preacher watching him slowed to match his step tom sauntered forward sidled embarrassedly toward the truck it wa a hudson super six sedan and the top had been ripped in two with a cold chisel old tom joad stood in the truck bed and he wa nailing on the top rail of the truck side his grizzled bearded face wa low over his work and a bunch of six penny nail stuck out of his mouth he set a nail and his hammer thundered it in from the house came the clash of a lid on the stove and the wail of a child joad sidled up to the grape of wrath the track bed and leaned against it and his father looked at him and did not see him his father set another nail and drove it in a flock of pigeon started from the deck of the tank house and flew around and settled again and strutted to the edge to look over white pigeon and blue pigeon and gray with iridescent wing joad hooked his finger over the lowest bar of the truck side he looked up at the aging graying man on the truck he wet his thick lip with his tongue and he said softly pa what do you want old tom mumbled around his mouthful of nail he wore a black dirty slouch hat and a blue work shirt over which wa a buttonless vest his jean were held up by a wide harness leather belt with a big square brass buckle leather and metal polished from year of wear ing and his shoe were cracked and the sol swollen and boat shaped from year of sun and wet and dust the sleeve of his shirt were tight on his forearm held down by the bulging powerful muscle stomach and hip were lean and leg short heavy and strong his face squared by a bristling pepper and salt beard wa all drawn down to the forceful chin a chin thrust out and built out by the stubble beard which wa not so grayed on the chin and gave weight and force to it thrust over old tom s umvhiskered cheek bone the skin wa a brown a meerschaum and wrinkled in ray around his eye corner from squinting his eye were brown black coffee brown and he thrust his head forward when he looked at a thing for his bright dark eye were failing his lip from which the big nail protruded were thin and red he held his hammer suspended in the air about to drive a set nail and he looked over the track side at tom looked resentful at being interrupted and then his chin drove for the grape of wrath ward and his eye lookfed at tom s face and then gradually his brain became aware of what he saw the hammer dropped slowly to his side and with his left hand he took the nail from his mouth and he said wonderingly a though he told himself the fact it s tommy and then still inform ing himself it s tommy come home his mouth opened again and a look of fear came into his eye tommy he said softly you ain t busted out you ain t got to hide he listened tensely ft naw said tom i m paroled i m free i got my paper he gripped the lower bar of the truck side and looked up old tom laid his hammer gently on the floor and put his nail in his pocket he swung his leg over the side and dropped lithely to the ground but once beside his son he seemed embarrassed and strange tommy he said we are goin to california but we wa gon na write you a letter an tell you and he said incredulously but you re back you can go with u you can go the lid of a coffee pot slammed in the house old tom looked over his shoulder u le s sup prise em he said and his eye shone with excitement your ma got a bad feelin she ain t never gon na see you no more she got that quiet look like when somebody died almost she don t want to go to california fear she ll never see you no more a stove lid clashed in the house again le s supprise em old tom repeated le s go in like you never been away le s jus see what your ma say at last he touched tom but touched him on the shoulder timidly and instantly took his hand away he looked at jim casy tom said you remember the preacher pa he come along with me he been in prison too the grape of wrath no i met im on the road he been away pa shook hand gravely you re welcome here sir casy said glad to be here it s a thing to see when a boy come home it s a thing to see home pa said to his folk the preacher amended quickly we stayed at the other place last night pa s chin thrust out and he looked back down the road for moment then he turned to tom plow ll we do her he began excitedly s pose i go in an say here s some fella want some breakfast or how d it be if you jus come in an stood there till she seen you how d that be his face wa alive with excitement don t le s give her no shock said tom don t le s scare her none two rangy shepherd dog trotted up pleasantly until they caught the scent of stranger and then they backed cau tiously away watchful their tail moving slowly and tenta tively in the air but their eye and nose quick for animosity or danger one of them stretching his neck edged forward ready to run and little by little he approached tom s leg and sniffed loudly at them then he backed away and watched pa for some kind of signal the other pup wa not so brave he looked about for something that could honor ably divert his attention saw a red chicken go mincing by find ran at it there wa the squawk of an outraged hen a burst of red feather and the hen ran off flapping stubby wing for speed the pup looked proudly back at the men and then flopped down in the dust and beat it tail content edly on the ground come on said pa come on in now she got to see you i got to see her face when she see you come on she ll yell the grape of wrath breakfast in a minute i heard her slap the salt pork in the pan a good time ago he led the way across the fine dusted ground there wa no porch on this house just a step and then the door a chopping block beside the door it surface matted and soft from year of chopping the graining in the sheathing wood wa high for the dust had cut down the softer wood the smell of burning willow wa in the air and a the three men neared the door the smell of frying side meat and the smell of high brown biscuit and the sharp smell of coffee rolling in the pot pa stepped up into the open doorway and stood there blocking it with his wide short body he said ma there s a coupla fella jus come along the road an they wonder if we could spare a bite tom heard his mother s voice the remembered cool calm drawl friendly and humble let em come she said we got a plenty tell em they got to wash their ban s the bread is done i m jus takin up the side meat now and the sizzle of the angry grease came from the stove pa stepped inside clearing the door and tom looked in at u mother she wa lifting the curling slice of pork from the frying pan the oven door wa open and a great pan of high brown biscuit stood waiting there she looked out the door but the sun wa behind tom and she saw only a dark figure outlined by the bright yellow sunlight she nodded pleasantly come in she said jus lucky i made plenty bread this morning tom stood looking in ma wa heavy but not fat thick with child bearing and work she wore a loose mother hub bard of gray cloth in which there had once been colored flower but the color wa washed out now so that the small flowered pattern wa only a little lighter gray than the back ground the dress came down to her ankle and her strong t s essm m mmmm iqo the grape of wrath broad bare foot moved quickly and deftly over the floor her thin steel gray hair wa gathered in a sparse wispy knot at the back of her head strong freckled arm were bare to the elbow and her hand were chubby and delicate like those of a plump little girl she looked out into the sunshine her full face wa not soft it wa controlled kindly her hazel eye seemed to have experienced all possible tragedy and to have mounted pain and suffering like step into a high calm and a superhuman understanding she seemed to know to accept to welcome her position the citadel of the family the strong place that could not be taken and since old tom and the child could not know hurt or fear unless she acknowledged hurt and fear she had prac ticed denying them in herself and since when a joyful thing happened they looked to see whether joy wa on her r it wa her habit to build up laughter out of inadequate mate rial but better than joy wa calm imperturbability could be depended upon and from her great and humble position in the family she had taken dignity and a clean calm beauty from her position a healer her hand had grown sure and cool and quiet from her position a arbiter she had become a remote and faultless in judgment a a goddess she seemed to know that if she swayed the family shook and if she ever really deeply wavered or despaired the family would fall the family will to function would be gone she looked out into the sunny yard at the dark figure of a man pa stood near by shaking with excitement come in he cried come right in mister and tom a little shame facedly stepped over the doorsill she looked up pleasantly from the frying pan and then her hand sank slowly to her side and the fork clattered to the wooden floor her eye opened wide and the pupil the grape of wrath ioi dilated she breathed

now she moved back to the stove and dumped the big pan of bulbous biscuit on two tin plate she shook flour into the deep grease to make gravy and her hand wa white with flour for a moment tom watched her and then he went to the door across the yard came four people grampa wa ahead a lean ragged quick old man jumping with quick step and favoring his right leg the side that came out of joint he iva buttoning his fly a he came and his old hand were hav the grape of wrath iug trouble finding the button for he had buttoned the top button into the second buttonhole and that threw the whole sequence off he wore dark ragged pant and a tom blue shirt open all the way down and showing long gray under wear also unbuttoned his lean white chest fuzzed with white hair wa visible through the opening in his underwear he gave up the fly and left it open and fumbled with the underwear button then gave the whole thing up and hitched his brown suspender his wa a lean excitable face with little bright eye a evil a a frantic child s eye a can tankerous complaining mischievous laughing face he fought and argued told dirty story he wa a lecherous a always vicious and cruel and impatient like a frantic child and the whole structure overlaid with amusement he drank too much when he could get it ate too much when it wa there talked too much all the time behind him hobbled granma who had survived only be cause she wa a mean a her husband she had held her own with a shrill ferocious religiosity that wa a lecherous and a savage a anything grampa could offer once after a meeting while she wa still speaking in tongue she fired both barrel of a shotgun at her husband ripping one of his buttock nearly off and after that he admired her and did not try to torture her a child torture bug a she walked she hiked her mother hubbard up to her knee and she bleated her shrill terrible war cry pu raise gawd fur vittory granma and grampa raced each other to get across the broad yard they fought over everything and loved and needed the fighting behind them moving slowly and evenly but keeping up f came pa and noah noah the first bom tall and strange the grape of wrath walking always with a wondering look on his face calm and puzzled he had never been angry in his life he looked in wonder at angry people wonder and uneasiness a normal people look at the insane noah moved slowly spoke seldom and then so slowly that people who did not know him often thought him stupid he wa not stupid but he wa strange fie had little pride no sexual urge he worked and slept in a curious rhythm that nevertheless sufficed him he wa fond of his folk but never showed it in any way although an observer could not have told why noah left the impression of being misshapen his head or his body or his leg or his mind but no misshapen member could be recalled pa thought he knew why noah wa strange but pa wa ashamed and never told for on the night when noah wa bom pa fright ened at the spreading thigh alone in the house and horrified at the screaming wretch his wife had become went mad with apprehension using his hand his strong finger for forceps he had pulled and twisted the baby the midwife arriving late had found the baby s head pulled out of shape it neck stretched it body warped and she had pushed the head back and molded the body with her hand but pa always remem bered and wa ashamed and he wa kinder to noah than to the others in noah s broad face eye too far apart and long fragile jaw pa thought he saw the twisted warped skull of the baby noah could do all that wa required of him could read and write could work and figure but he didn t seem to care there wa a listlessness in him toward thing people wanted and needed he lived in a strange silent house and looked out of it through calm eye he wa a stranger to all the world but he wa not lonely the four came across the yard and grampa demanded where is he goddamn it where is he and his finger the grape of wrath fumbled for his pant button and forgot and strayed into his pocket and then he saw tom standing in the door grampa stopped and he stopped the others his little eye glittered with malice lookut him he said a

preacher no more say her said granma an get in a word about u goin to california the preacher bowed his head and the others bowed their head ma folded her hand over her stomach and bowed her head granma bowed so low that her nose wa nearly in her plate of biscuit and gravy tom lean ing against the wall a plate in his hand bowed stiffly and grampa bowed his head sidewise so that he could keep one mean and merry eye on the preacher and on the preacher s face there wa a look not of prayer but of thought and in his tone not supplication but conjecture i been thinkin he said i been in the hill thinking almost you might say like jesus went into the wilderness to think his way out of a mess of trouble pu raise gawd granma said and the preacher glanced over at her in surprise seems like jesus got all messed up with trouble couldn t figure nothin out an he got to feelin what the hell good is it all an what s the use fightin an no the grape of wrath come to the conclusion the hell with it an so he went off into the wilderness a men granma bleated so many year she had timed her response to the pause and it wa so many year since she had listened to or wondered at the word used i ain t sayin i m like jesus the preacher went on but i got tired like him an i got mixed up like him an i went into the wilderness like him without no campin stuff nighttime i d lay on my back an look up at the star morn ing i d set an watch the sun come up midday i d look out from a hill at the rollin dry country evenin i d foller the sun down sometimes i d pray like i always done on y i couldn figure what i wa prayin to or for there wa the hill an there wa me an we wasn t separate no more we wa one thing an that one thing wa holy hallelujah said granma and she rocked a little back and forth trying to

unholy when one mi able little fella got the bit in his teeth an run off his own way kickin an draggin an fightin fella like that bust the holiness but when they re all workin together not one fella for another fella but one fella kind of harnessed to the whole shebang that s right that s holy an then i got thinkin i don t even know what i mean by holy he paused but the bowed head stayed down for they had been trained like dog to rise at the amen signal i can t say no grace like i use ta say i m glad of the holiness of breakfast i m glad there s love here that s all the head stayed down the preacher ill the grape of wrath looked around i ve got your breakfast cold he said and then he remembered amen he said and all the head rose up a men said granma and she fell to her breakfast and broke down the soggy biscuit with her hard old toothless gum tom ate quickly and pa crammed his mouth there wa no talk until the food wa gone the coffee drunk only the crunch of chewed food and the slup of coffee cooled in transit to the tongue ma watched the preacher a he ate and her eye were questioning probing and understanding she watched him a though he were suddenly a spirit not human any more a voice out of the ground the men finished and put down their plate and drained the last of their coffee and then the men went out pa and the preacher and noah and grampa and tom and they walked over to the truck avoiding the litter of furniture the wooden bedstead the windmill machinery the old plow they walked to the truck and stood beside it they touched the new pine side board tom opened

where a thin shadow fell and they complained shrilly now and then the two dog were stretched in the red dust under the truck panting dieir dripping tongue covered with dust pa pulled his hat low over his eye and squatted down on hir h l l ft t if is i i i m ml the grape of wrath ham and a though this were his natural position of thought and observation he surveyed tom critically the new but aging

smart aleck draggin his tail home right now he said look purty wore out too tom and the preacher looked up the road and randy al seeing he wa being noticed threw back his shoulder and he came into the yard with a swaying strut like that of a rooster about to crow cockily he walked close before he recognized tom and when he did his boasting face changed and admiration and veneration shone in his eye and his swagger fell away his stiff jean with the bottom turned up eight inch to show his heeled boot his three the grape of wrath inch belt with copper figure on it even the red arm band on his blue shirt and the rakish angle of his stetson hat could not build him up to his brother s stature for his brother had killed a man and no one would ever forget it a knew that even he had inspired some admiration among boy of his own age because his brother had killed a man fie had heard in sajlisaw how he wa pointed out that s a joad his brother killed a fella with a shovel and now al moving humbly near saw that his brother wa not a swaggerer a he had supposed al saw the dark brooding eye of his brother and the prison calm the smooth hard face trained to indicate nothing to a prison guard neither resistance nor slavishness and instantly a changed unconsciously he became like his brother and his handsome face brooded and his shoulder relaxed he hadn t remembered how tom wa tom said hello jesus you re growin like a bean wouldn t of knowed you al his hand ready if tom should want to shake it grinned self consciously tom stuck out his hand and al s hand jerked out to meet it and

here ma threw some stick into the stove get you a bite now but it ain t much grampa brought his box outside and sat on it and leaned against the wall and tom and casy leaned back against the in the late afternoon the truck came back bumping and rattling through the dust and there wa a layer of dust in the bed and the hood wa covered with dust and the head light were obscured with a red flour the sun wa setting when the truck came back and the earth wa bloody in it setting light a sat bent over the wheel proud and serious and efficient and pa and uncle john a befitted the head of the clan had the honor seat beside the driver standing in the truck bed holding onto the bar of the side rode the others twelve year old ruthie and ten year old winfield grime faced and wild their eye tired but excited their finger and the edge of their mouth black and sticky from licorice whip whined out of their father in town ruthie f dressed in a real dress of pink muslin that came below her knee wa a little serious in her young ladiness but winfield wa still a trifle of a snot nose a little of a brooder back of the barn and an inveterate collector and smoker of snipe and whereas ruthie felt the might the responsibility and the dignity of her developing breast winfield wa kid wild and calfish beside them clinging lightly to the bar stood rose of sharon and she balanced swaying on the ball of her foot and took up the road shock in her knee and ham for rose of sharon wa pregnant and careful pier hair braided and wrapped around her head made an ash blond crown her round soft face which had been voluptuous and inviting a few month ago had already put on the barrier of pregnancy the self sufficient smile the knowing perfection look and her plump body full soft breast and stomach the grape of wrath house wall and the shadow of the afternoon moved out from the house the grape of wrath hard hip and buttock that had swung so freely and provoc atively a to invite slapping and stroking her whole body had become demure and serious her whole thought and action were directed inward on the baby she balanced on her toe now for the baby s sake and the world wa preg nant to her she thought only in term of reproduction and of motherhood connie her nineteen year old husband who had married a plump passionate hoyden wa still frightened and bewildered at the change in her for there were no more cat fight in bed biting and scratching with muffled giggle and final tear there wa a balanced careful wise creature who smiled shyly but very firmly at him connie wa proud and fearful of rose of sharon whenever he could he put a hand on her or stood close so that his body touched her at hip and shoulder and he felt that this kept a relation that might be departing he wa a sharp faced lean young man of a texas strain and his pale blue eye were sometimes dan gerous and sometimes kindly and sometimes frightened he wa a good hard worker and would make a good husband he drank enough but not too much fought when it wa re quired of him and never boasted he sat quietly in a gather ing and yet managed to be there and to be recognized had he not been fifty year old and so one of the natural ruler of the family uncle john would have preferred not to sit in the honor place beside the driver he would have liked rose of sharon to sit there this wa impossible be cause she wa young and a woman but uncle john sat un easily his lonely haunted eye were not at ease and his thin strong body wa not relaxed nearly all the time the barrier of loneliness cut uncle john off from people and from appe tites he ate little drank nothing and wa celibate but underneath his appetite swelled into pressure until they the grape of wrath broke through then he would eat of some craved food until he wa sick or he would drink jake or whisky until he wa a shaken paralytic with red wet eye or he would raven with lust for some whore in sallisaw it wa told of him that once he went clear to shawnee and hired three whore in one bed and snorted and rutted on their unresponsive body for an hour but when one of his appetite wa sated he wa sad and ashamed and lonely again he hid from people and by gift tried to make up to all people for himself then he crept into house and left gum under pillow for child then he cut wood and took no pay then he gave away any possession he might have a saddle a horse a new pair of shoe one could not talk to him then for he ran away or if confronted hid within himself and peeked out of frightened eye the death of his wife followed by month of being alone had marked him with guilt and shame and had left an unbreaking loneliness on him but there were thing he could not escape being one ol the head of the family he had to govern and now he had to sit on the honor seat beside the driver the three men on the seat were glum a they drove toward home over the dusty road al bending over the wheel kept shifting eye from the road to the instrument panel watching the ammeter needle which jerked sus piciously watching the oil gauge and the heat indicator and his mind wa cataloguing weak point and suspicious thing about the car he listened to the whine which might be the rear end dry and he listened to tappet lifting and falling he kept his hand on the gear lever feeling the turn ing gear through it and he had let the clutch out against the brake to test for slipping clutch plate he might be a m illing goat sometimes but this wa his responsibility this the grape of wrath truck it running and it maintenance if something went wrong it would be his fault and while no one would say it everyone and a most of all would know it wa his fault and so he felt it watched it and listened to it and his face wa serious and responsible and everyone respected him and his responsibility even pa who wa the leader would hold a wrench and take order from al they were all tired on the truck ruthie and winfield were tired from seeing too much movement too many face from fighting to get licorice whip tired from the excite ment of having uncle john secretly slip gum into their and the men in the seat were tired and angry and sad for they had got eighteen dollar for every movable thing from the farm the horse the wagon the implement and all the furniture from the house eighteen dollar they had a sailed the buyer argued but they were routed when his interest seemed to flag and he had told them he didn t want the stuff at any price then they were beaten believed him and took two dollar less than he had first offered and now they were weary and frightened because they had gone against a system they did not understand and it had beaten them they knew the team and the wagon were worth much more they knew the buyer man would get much more but they didn t know how to do it merchandising wa a secret to them al his eye darting from road to panel board said that fella he ain t a local fella didn talk like a local fella clothes wa different too and pa

gine wa noisy full of little clashings and the brake rod banged there wa a wooden creaking from the wheel and a thin jet of steam escaped through a hole in the top of the radiator cap the truck pulled a high whirling column of red dust behind it they rumbled up the last little rise while the grape of wrath the sun wa still half face above the horizon and they bore down on the house a it disappeared the brake squealed when they stopped and the sound printed in afs head no lining left ruthie and winfield climbed yelling over the side wall and dropped to the ground they shouted where is he where s tom and then they saw him standing beside the door and they stopped embarrassed and walked slowly toward him and looked shyly at him and when he said hello how you kid doin they re plied softly hello all right and they stood apart and watched him secretly the great brother who had killed a man and been in prison they remembered how they had played prison in the chicken coop and fought for the right to be prisoner connie river lifted the high tail gate out of the truck and got down and helped rose of sharon to the ground and she accepted it nobly smiling her wise self satisfied smile mouth tipped at the comer a little fatuously tom said why it s rosasharn i didn know you wa cornin with them we wa walkin she said the track come by an picked u up and then she said this is connie my hus band and she wa grand saying it the two shook hand sizing each other up looking deeply into each other and in a moment each wa satisfied and tom said well i see you been busy she looked down you do

tree all aroun rose of sharon felt her stomach with both her hand a you do not see she said and she smiled her complacent smile and went into the house the evening wa hot and the thrust of light still flowed up from the western horizon and without any signal the family gathered by the track and the congress the family government went into session the film of evening light made the red earth lucent so that it dimension were deepened so that a stone a post a building had greater depth and more solidity than in the day time light and these object were curiously more individual a post wa more essentially a post set off from the earth it stood in and the field of corn it stood out against and plant were individual not the mass of crop and the ragged wil low tree wa itself standing free of all other willow tree the earth contributed a light to the evening the front of the gray paintless house facing the west wa luminous a the moon is the gray dusty truck in the yard before the door stood out magically in this light in the overdrawn per spective of a stereopticon the people too were changed in the evening quieted they seemed to be a part of an organization of the uncon scious they obeyed impulse which registered only faintly in their thinking mind their eye were inward and quiet and their eye too were lucent in the evening lucent in dusty face the family met at the most important place near the truck the house wa dead and the field were dead but this truck wa the active thing the living principle the ancient hudson with bent and scarred radiator screen with i the grape of wrath grease in dusty globule at the worn edge of every moving part with hub cap gone and cap of red dust in their place this wa the new hearth the living center of the family half passenger car and half track high sided and clumsy pa walked around the truck looking at it and then he squatted down in the dust and found a stick to draw with one foot wa flat to the ground the other rested on the ball and slightly back so that one knee wa higher than the other left forearm rested on the lower left knee the right elbow on the right knee and the right fist cupped for the chin pa squatted there looking at the truck his chin in his cupped fist and uncle john moved toward him and squatted down beside him their eye were brooding grampa came out of the house and saw the two squatting together and he jerked over and sat on the running board of the track facing them that wa the nucleus tom and connie and noah strolled in and squatted and the line wa a half circle with grampa in the opening and then ma came out of the house and granma with her and rose of sharon behind walking daintily they took their place behind the squatting men they stood up and put their hand on their hip and the child ruthie and winfield hopped from foot to foot be side the woman the child squidged their toe in the red dust but they made no sound only the preacher wa not tk e he out of delicacy wa sitting on the ground behind the house he wa a good preacher and knew his people the evening light grew softer and for a while the family sat and stood silently then pa speaking to no one but te the group made his report got skinned on the stuff we sold the fella knowed we couldn t wait got eighteen dol lars only m the grape of wrath ma stirred restively but she held her peace noah the oldest son

over tommy if he s goin he ought ta be here tom got up from his ham and went toward the house calling casy oh casy a muffled voice replied from behind the house tom walked to the corner and saw the

thing out casy got to his foot he knew the government of family and he knew he had been taken into the family indeed his position wa eminent for uncle john moved sideways leav ing space between pa and himself for the preacher casy squatted down like the others facing grampa enthroned on the running board ma went to the house again there wa a screech of a lantern hood and the yellow light flashed up in the dark kitchen when she lifted the lid of the big pot the smell of boiling side meat and beet green came out the door they waited for her to come back across the darkening yard for ma wa powerful in the group pa said we got to figger when to start sooner the better what we got to do fore we go is get them pig slaughtered an in salt an pack our stuff an go quicker the better now tt vt the grape

said again and she knew this wa the great time in her life so far the adult moved toward the lighted kitchen through the deep dusk and ma served them green and side meat in tin plate but before ma ate she put the big round wash tub on the stove and started the fire to roaring she carried bucket of water until the tub wa full and then around the tub she the grape of wrath clustered the bucket full of water the kitchen became a swamp of heat and the family ate hurriedly and went out to sit on the doorstep until the water should get hot they sat looking out at the dark at the square of light the kitchen lantern threw on the ground outside the door with a hunched shadow of grampa in the middle of it noah picked his teeth thoroughly with a broom straw ma and rose of sharon washed up the dish and piled them on the table and then ail of a sudden the family began to function pa got up and lighted another lantern noah from a box in the kitchen brought out the bow bladed butchering knife and whetted it on a worn little carborundum stone and he laid the scraper on the chopping block and the knife beside it pa brought two sturdy stick each three foot long and pointed the end with the ax and he tied strong rope double half hitched to the middle of the stick he grumbled shouldn t of sold those singletrees all of em the water in the pot steamed and rolled noah asked gon na take the water

the preacher walked down to help all right said pa stick em an we ll run em up and bleed an scald at the house noah and tom stepped o vet the fence they slaughtered quickly and efficiently tom struck twice with the blunt head of the ax and noah leaning over the felled pig found the great artery with his curving knife and released the pulsing stream of blood then over the fence with the squealing pig the preacher and uncle john dragged one by the hind leg and tom and noah the other pa walked along with the lantern and the black blood made two trail in the dust at the house noah slipped his knife between tendon and bone of the hind leg the pointed stick held the leg apart and the carcass were hung from the two by four rafter that stuck out from the house then the men carried the boiling water and poured it over the black body noah slit the body from end to end and dropped the entrails out on the ground pa sharpened two more stick to hold the body open to the air while tom with the scrubber and ma with a dull knife scraped the skin to take out the bristle a brought a bucket and shoveled the entrails into it and dumped them on the ground away from the house and two cat followed him mewing loudly and the dog followed him growling lightly at the cat pa sat on the doorstep and looked at the pig hanging in the lantern light the scraping wa done now and only a few drop of blood continued to fall from the carcass into the black pool on the ground pa got up and went to the pig and felt them with his hand and then he sat down again granma and grampa went toward the bam to sleep and grampa carried a candle lantern in his hand the rest of the the grape of wrath family sat quietly about the doorstep connie and a and tom on the ground leaning their back against the house wall uncle john on a box pa in the doorway only ma and rose of sharon continued to move about ruthie and win field were sleepy now but fighting it off they quarreled sleepily out in the darkness noah and

cleaned the rib and the spine and leg bone of all the meat he could she put them in the oven to roast for gnawing purpose in the yard and in the barn the circle of lantern light moved about and the men brought together all the thing to be taken and piled them by the truck rose of sharon brought out all the clothes the family possessed the over alls the thick soled shoe the rubber boot the worn best suit the sweater and sheepskin coat and she packed these tightly into a wooden box and got into the box and tramped them down and then she brought out the print dress and shawl the black cotton

piled them up ma and noah worked busily at the carcass and the smell of roasting pork bone came from the stove the child had fallen by the way in the late night winfield lay curled up in the dust outside the door and ruthie sitting on a box in the kitchen where she had gone to watch the butchering had dropped her head back against the wall she breathed easily in her sleep and her lip were parted over her teeth tom finished with the tool and came into the kitchen with his lantern and the preacher followed him a god in a buckboard tom said smell that meat an listen to her crackle ma laid the brick of meat in a keg and poured salt around and over them and covered the layer with salt and patted it down she looked up at tom and smiled a little at him but her eye were serious and tired be

much of it to split it up to men s or woman s work you got stuff to do leave me salt the meat still for a moment she stared at him and then she poured water from a bucket into the tin wash basin and she washed the grape of wrath her hand the preacher took up the block of pork and patted on the salt while she watched him and he laid them in the keg a she had only when he had finished a layer and

sick tar d ma wa just through the door and she heard his word slowly her relaxed face tightened and the line disappeared from the taut muscular face her eye sharpened and her shoulder straightened she glanced about the stripped room nothing wa left in it except trash the mattress which had the grape of wrath been on the floor were gone the bureau were sold on th floor la y a broken comb an empty talcum powder can and a few dust mouse ma set her lantern on the floor she reached behind one of the box that had served a chair and brought out a stationery box old and soiled and cracked at the cor ners she sat down and opened the box inside were letter clipping photograph a pair of earring a little gold signet ring and a watch chain braided of hair and tipped with gold swivel she touched the letter with her finger touched them lightly and she smoothed a newspaper clipping on which there wa an account of tom s trial for a long time she held the box looking over it and her finger disturbed the letter and then lined them up again she bit her lower lip thinking remembering and at last she made up her mind she picked out the ring the watch charm the earring dug under the pile and found one gold cuff link she took a letter from an envelope and dropped the trinket in the en velope she folded the envelope over and put it in her dress pocket then gently and tenderly she closed the oox and smoothed the top carefully with her finger her lip parted and then she stood up took her lantern and went back into the kitchen she lifted the stove lid and laid the box gently among the coal quickly the heat browned the paper a flame licked up and over the box she replaced the stove lid and instantly the fire sighed up and breathed over the box out in the dark yard working in the lantern light pa and a loaded the truck tool on the bottom but handy to reach in case of a breakdown box of clothes next arid kitchen utensil in a gunny sack cutlery and dish in their box then the gallon bucket tied on behind they made the the grape of wrath bottom of the load a even a possible and filled the space between box with rolled blanket then over the top they laid the mattress filling the track in level and last they spread the big tarpaulin over the load and a made hole in the edge two foot apart and inserted little rope and tied it down to the side bar of the truck now if it rain he said well tie

were ready granma giddy and vague saying what s all this what you doin now so early but she wa dressed and agreeable and ruthie and winfield were awake but quiet with the pressure of tiredness and still half dreaming the light wa sifting rapidly over the land and the movement of the family stopped they stood about re luctant to make the first active move to go they were afraid now that the time had come afraid in the same way grampa wa afraid they saw the shed take shape against the light and they saw the lantern pale until they no longer cast their circle of yellow light the star went out few by few toward the west and still the family stood about like dream walker their eye focused panoramically seeing no detail but the whole dawn the whole land the whole texture of die country at once only muley graf prowled about restlessly looking through the bar into the truck thumping the spare tire hung on the back of the truck and at last muley approached tom you goin over the state line he asked you gon na break your parole and tom shook himself free of the numbness jesus christ it s near sunrise he said loudly we got to get goin and the others came out of their numbness and moved toward the truck come on tom said le s get grampa on pa and uncle john and tom and a went into the kitchen where grampa slept his forehead down on his arm and a line of drying coffee on the table they took him under the elbow and lifted him to his foot and he grumbled and cursed thickly like a drunken man out the door they boosted him tnd when they came to the truck tom and a climbed up the grape of wrath and leaning over hooked their hand under his arm and lifted him gently up and laid him on top of the load a un tied the tarpaulin and they rolled him under and put a box under the tarp beside him so that the weight of the heavy canvas would not be upon him i got to get that ridge pole fixed a said do her to nighwwhen we stop grampa grunted and fought weakly against awakening and when he wa finally settled he went deeply to sleep again pa said ma you an granma set in with a for a while we ll change aroun so it s easier but you start out that way they got into the cab and then the rest swarmed up on top of the load connie and rose of sharon pa and uncle john ruthie and winfield tom and the preacher noah stood on the ground looking up at the great load of them sitting on top of the truck a walked around looking underneath at the spring holy jesus he said them spring is flat a hell lucky i blocked under em noah said how about the dog pa i forgot the dog pa said he whistled shrilly and one bouncing dog ran in but only one noah caught him and threw him up on the top where he sat rigid and shivering at the height got to leave the other two pa called muley will you look after em some see they don t starve yeah said muley i ll like to have a couple dog yeah i ll take em take them chicken too pa said ai got into the driver s seat the starter whirred and caught and whirred again and then the loose roar of the six cylinder and a blue smoke behind so long muley a called the grape of wrath and the family called good by muley a slipped in the low gear and let in the clutch the track shuddered and strained across the yard and the second gear took hold they crawled up the little hill and the red dust arose about them chr ist what a load said al we ain t makin no time on this trip ma tried to look back but the body of the load cut off her view she straightened her head and peered straight ahead along the dirt road and a great weariness wa in her eye the people on top of the load did look back they saw the house and the bam and a little smoke still rising from the chimney they saw the window reddening under the first color of the sun they saw muley standing forlornly in the dooryard looking after them and then the hill cut them off the cotton field lined the road and the truck crawled slowly through the dust toward the highway and the west chapter eleven t he house were left vacant on the land and the land wa vacant because of this only the tractor shed of corrugated iron silver and gleaming were alive and they were alive with metal and gasoline and oil the disk of the plow shining the tractor had light shining for there is no day and night for a tractorand the disk turn the earth in the darkness and they glitter in the daylight and when a horse stop work and go into the bam there is a life and a vitality left there is a breathing and a warmth and the foot shift on the straw and the jaw champ on the hay and the ear and the eye are alive there is a warmth of life in the barn and the heat and smell of life but when the motor of a tractor stop it is a dead a the ore it came from the heat go out of it like the living heat that leaf a corpse then the corrugated iron door are closed and the tractor man drive home to town perhaps twenty mile away and he need not come back for week or month fot the tractor is dead and this is easy and efficient so easy that the wonder go out of work so efficient that the wonder go out of land and the working of it and with the wonder the deep understanding and the relation and in the tractor man there grows the contempt that come only to a stranger who ha little understanding and no relation for nitrate are not the land nor phosphate and the length of fiber in the ijb the grape of wrath cotton is not the land carbon is not a man nor salt nor water nor calcium he is all these but he is much more much more and the land is so much more than it analysis the man who is more than his chemistry walking on the earth turning his plow point for a stone dropping his handle to slide over an outcropping kneeling in the earth to eat his lunch that man who is more than his element know the land that is more than it analysis but the machine man driving a dead tractor on land he doe not know and love understands only chemis try and he is contemptuous of the land and of himself when the corrugated iron door are shut he go home and his home is not the land the door of the empty house swung open and drifted back and forth in the wind band of little boy came out from the town to break the window and to pick over the debris looking for treasure and here s a knife with half the blade gone that s a good thing and smell like a rat died here and look what whitey wrote on the wall he wrote that in the toilet in school too an teacher made im wash it off when the folk first left and the evening of the first day came the hunting cat slouched in from the field and mewed on the porch and when no one came out the cat crept through the open door and walked mewing through the empty room and then they went back to the field and were wild cat from then on hunting gopher and field mouse and sleeping in ditch in the daytime when the night came the bat which had stopped at the door for fear of light swooped into the house and sailed about through the empty room and in a little while they stayed in dark room corner during the day folded their wing high and hung head the grape of wrath down among the rafter and the smell of their droppings wa in the empty house and the mouse moved in and stored weed seed in cor ners in box in the back of drawer in the kitchen and weasel came in to hunt the mouse and the brown owl flew shrieking in and out again now there came a little shower the weed sprang up in front of the doorstep where they had not been allowed and grass grew up through the porch board the house were vacant and a vacant house fall quickly apart split started up the sheathing from the rusted nail a dust settled on the floor and only mouse and weasel and cat track disturbed it on a night the wind loosened a shingle and flipped it to the ground the next wind pried into the hole where the shingle had been lifted off three and the next a dozen the midday sun burned through the hole and threw a glaring spot on the floor the wild cat crept in from the field a t night but they did not mew at the doorstep any more they moved like shadow of a cloud across the moon into the room to hunt the mouse and on windy night the door banged and the ragged curtain fluttered in the broken win dows tighway is the main migrant road the long concrete path across the country waving gently up jl and down on the map from the mississippi to bakersfield over the red land and the gray land twisting up into the mountain crossing the divide and down into the bright and terrible desert and across the desert to the moun tains again and into the rich california valley is the path of a people in flight refugee from dust and shrinking land from the thunder of tractor and shrinking ownership from the desert s slow northward invasion from the twisting wind that howl up out of texas from the flood that bring no richness to the land and steal what little richness is there from all of these the people are in flight and they come into from the tributary side road from the wagon track and the rutted country road is the mother road the road of flight clarksville and ozark and van buren and fort smith on and there s an end of arkansas and all the road into oklahoma

and now the high mountain holbrook and winslow and flagstaff in the high mountain of arizona then the great plateau rolling like a ground swell ashfork and kingman and stone mountain again where water must be hauled and sold then out of the broken sun rotted mountain of ark zona to the colorado with green reed on it bank and that s the end of arizona there s california just over the river and a pretty town to start it needle on the river but the river is a stranger in this place up from needle and over a burned range and there s the desert and go on over the terrible desert where the distance shimmer and the black center mountain hang unbearably in the distance at last there s barstow and more desert until at last the mountain rise up again the good mountain and wind through them then suddenly a pas and below the beauti ful valley below orchard and vineyard and little house and in the distance a city and oh my god it s over the people in flight streamed out on sometimes a sin

they pulled in a stout man red of face and arm got up from a chair behind the gas pump and moved toward them he wore brown corduroy and suspender and a polo shirt and he had a cardboard sun helmet

radiator on top of the truck the suffering hound doa crawled timidly to the edge of the load and looked over whimpering toward the water uncle john climbed up and lifted him down by the scruff of the neck for a moment the dog staggered on stiff leg and then he went to lap the mud under the faucet in the highway the car whizzed by glis tening in the heat and the hot wind of their going fanned into

brave the brave yellow paint that had tried to imitate the big company station in town but the paint couldn t cover the old nail hole and the old crack in the lumber and the paint could not be renewed the imita tion wa a failure and the owner had known it wa a failure and inside the open door of the shack tom saw the oil bar rels only two of them and the candy counter with stale candy and licorice whip turning brown with age and cigarette he saw the broken chair and the fly screen with a rusted hole in it and the littered yard that should have been graveled and behind the corn field drying and dying in the sun beside the house the little stock of used tire and re treaded tire and he saw for the first time the fat man s cheap washed pant and his cheap polo shirt and his paper hat he said i

water hose connie and rose of sharon stood together talking secretly connie washed the tin cup and felt the water with his finger before he filled the cup again rose of sharon watched the car go by on the highway connie held out the cup to her this water ain t cool but it s wet he said she looked at him and smiled secretly she wa all secret now she wa pregnant secret and little silence that seemed to have meaning she wa pleased with herself and she com plained about thing that didn t really matter and she de manded service of connie that were silly and both of them knew they were silly connie wa pleased with her too and filled with wonder that she wa pregnant he liked to think he wa in on the secret she had when she smiled slyly he smiled slyly too and they exchanged confidence in whis pers the world had drawn close around them and they i the grape of wrath were in the center of it or rather rose of sharon wa m the center of it with connie making a small orbit about her everything they said wa a kind of secret she drew her eye from the highway i ain t very thirsty she said daintily but maybe i ought to drink and he nodded for he knew well what she meant she took the cup and rinsed her mouth and spat and then drank the cupful of tepid water want another he asked jus a half and so he filled the cup just half and gave it to her a lincoln zephyr silvery and low whisked by she turned to see where the others were and saw them clustered about the truck reassured she said how d you like to be goin along in that connie sighed maybe after they both knew what he meant an if

we got to do that or we won t never get to california i know she said the dog wandered sniffing past the truck trotted to the puddle under the hose again and lapped at the muddy water and then he moved away nose down and ear hanging he sniffed his way among the dusty weed beside the road to the edge of the pavement he raised his head and looked across and then started over rose of sharon screamed the grape of wrath ijj shrilly a big swift car whisked near tire squealed the dog dodged helplessly and with a shriek cut off in the mid dle went under the w r heel the big car slowed for a mo ment and face looked back and then it gathered greater speed and disappeared and the dog a blot of blood and tangled burst intestine kicked slowly in the road rose of sharon s eye were wide d you think it ll hurt she begged think it ll hurt connie put his arm around her come set down he said it wasn t nothin but i felt it hurt i felt it kinda jar when i yelled come set down it wasn t nothin it

corn field ruthie ahead and winfield trailing her egg ruthie cried i got sof egg she rushed close with winfield close behind look a dozen soft grayish white egg were in her grubby hand and a she held up her hand her eye fell upon the dead dog beside the road oh she said ruthie and winfield walked slowly toward the dog they inspected him pa called to them come on you less you want to git left they turned solemnly and walked to the truck ruthie the grape of wrath looked once more at the gray reptile egg in her hand and then she threw them away they climbed up the side of the track his eye wa still open said ruthie in a hushed tone but winfield gloried in the scene fie said boldly his gut wa just strowed all over all over he wa silent for a moment strowed all over he said and then he rolled over quickly and vomited down the side of the track when he sat up again his eye were watery and his nose running it ain t like killin pig he said in explanation a had the hood of the hudson up and he checked the oil level he brought a gallon can from the floor of the from seat and poured a quantity of cheap black oil into the pip and checked the level again tom came beside him want i should

said you can re easy the family piled on top of the truck again ma settled her self beside granina in the seat and tom took his place and started the motor sure is loose he said and he put it in gear and pulled away down the highway the motor droned along steadily and the sun receded down the sky in front of them granma slept steadily and i o the grape of wrath even ma dropped her head forward and dozed tom pulled his cap over his eye to shut out the blinding sun paden to meeker is thirteen mile meeker to harrah is fourteen mile and then oklahoma city the big city tom drove straight on ma waked up and looked at the street a they went through the city and the family on top of the truck stared about at the store at the big house at the office building and then the building grew smaller and the store smaller the wrecking yard and hot dog stand the out city dance hall ruthie and winfield saw it all and it embarrassed them with it bigness and it strangeness and it frightened them with the fine clothed people they saw they did not speak of it to each other later they would but not now they saw the oil derrick in the town on the edge of the town oil derrick black and the smell of oil and gas in the air but they didn t exclaim it wa so big and so strange it frightened them in the street rose of sharon saw a man in a light suit he wore white shoe and a flat straw hat she touched connie and indicated the man with her eye and then connie and rose of sharon giggled softly to themselves and the giggle got the best of them they covered their mouth and it felt so good that they looked for other people to giggle at ruthie and w infi eld saw them giggling and it looked such fun that they tried to do it too but they couldn t the gig gles wouldn t come but connie and rose of sharon were breathless and red with stifling laughter before they could stop it got so bad that they had only to look at each other to start over again the outskirt were wide spread tom drove slowly and carefully in the traffic and then they were on the great the grape of wrath western road and the sun wa sinking on the line of the road the windshield wa bright with dust tom pulled his cap lower over his eye so low that he had to tilt his head back to see out at all granma slept on the sun on her closed eyelid and the vein on her temple were blue and the little bright vein on her cheek were wine colored and the old brown mark on her face turned darker tom said we stay on this road right straight through ma had been silent for a long time maybe we better fin a place to stop fore sunset she said i got

out of a stove pipe through the tent tom pointed ahead there s some folk campin look like a good a place a we seen he slowed his motor and pulled to a stop beside the road the hood of the old touring car wa up and a middle aged man stood looking down at the motor he wore a cheap straw sombrero a blue shirt and a black spotted vest and his jean were stiff and shiny with dirt his face wa lean the deep cheek line great furrow down his face so that his cheek bone and chin stood out sharply he looked up at the joad truck and his eye were puzzled and angry tom leaned out of the window any law gainst folk stoppin here for the night the man had seen only the truck his eye focused down on tom i dunno he said we on y stopped here cause we couldn t git no further any water here the man pointed

look out of a well of horror she wa small and shuddering she held herself upright by a tent flap and the hand holding onto the canvas wa a skeleton covered with wrinkled skin when she spoke her voice had a beautiful low timbre soft and modulated and yet with ringing overtone tell em welcome she said tell em good an welcome tom drove off the road and brought his truck into the field and lined it up with the touring car and people boiled down from the truck ruthie and winfield too quickly so that their leg gave way and they shrieked at the pin and needle that ran through their limb ma went quickly to work she untied the three gallon bucket from the back of the truck and approached the squealing child now you go git water right down there ask nice say please kin we git a bucket a water and say thank you an carry it back together helpin an don t spill none an if you see the grape of wrath stick wood to burn bring it on the child stamped away toward the shack by the tent a little

warning grampa began to cry his chin wavered and his old lip tightened over his mouth and he sobbed hoarsely ma rushed over to him and put her arm around him she lifted him to his foot her broad back straining and she half lifted half helped him into the tent uncle john said he must be good an sick he ain t never done that before never seen him blubberin in my life he jumped up on the truck and tossed a mattress down ma came out of the tent and went to casy you been aroun sick people she said grampa s sick won t you go take a look at him casy walked quickly to the tent and went inside a double mattress wa on the ground the blanket spread neatly and a little tin stove stood on iron leg and the fire in it burned unevenly a bucket of water a wooden box of supply and a box for a table that wa all the light of the setting sun came pinkly through the tent wall sairy wilson knelt on the ground beside the mattress and grampa lay on his back his eye were open staring upward and his cheek were flushed he breathed heavily casy took the skinny old wrist in his finger feeling kinda tired grampa he asked the staring eye moved toward his voice but did not find him the lip practiced a speech but did not speak it casy felt the pulse and he dropped the wrist and put his hand on grampa s forehead a struggle began in the old man s body his leg moved rest lessly and his hand stirred he said a whole string of blurred sound that were not word and his face wa red under the spiky white whisker sairy wilson spoke softly to casy know what s wrong the grape of wrath he looked op at the wrinkled face and the burning eye s t o you i think so what casy asked might be wrong i wouldn like to say casy looked back at the twitching red face would you say maybe he s workin up a stroke i d say that said sairy i seen it three time before from outside came the sound of camp making wood chopping and the rattle of pan ma looked through the flap granma want to come in would she better the preacher said she ll jus fret if she don t think he s a wright ma asked casy shook his head slowly ma looked quickly down at the struggling old face with blood pounding through it she drew outside and her voice came through he s awright granma he s jus takin a little re and granma answered sulkily well i want ta see him he s a tricky devil he wouldn t never let ya know and she came scurrying through the flap she stood over the mattress and looked down what s the matter d you she demanded of grampa and again his eye reached toward her voice and his lip writhed he s sulkin said granma i tol you he wa tricky he wa gon na sneak away this mornin so he wouldn t have to come an then his hip got a hurtin she said disgustedly he s jus sulkin i seen him when he wouldn talk to nobody before casy

know all the stuff fay heart i can t said casy i don know what to pray for oj who to pray to granma s eye wandered away and came to rest on sairy he won t pray she said d l ever tell ya how ruthie prayed when she wa a little skinner say now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep an when she got there the cupboard wa bare an so the poor dog got none amen that s jus what she done the shadow of someone walking between the tent and the sun crossed the canvas grampa seemed to be struggling all his muscle twitched and suddenly he jarred a though under a heavy blow he lay still and his breath wa stopped casy looked down at the old man s face and saw that it wa turning a blackish purple sairy touched casy s shoulder she whispered his tongue his tongue his tongue casy nodded get in front a granma fie pried the tight jaw apart and reached into the old man s throat for the tongue and a he lifted it clear a rattling breath came out and a sobbing breath wa indrawn casy found a stick on the ground and held down the tongue with it and the uneven breath rattled in and out granma hopped about like a chicken pray she said pray you pray i tell ya sairy tried to hold her back pray goddamn you granma cried the grape of wrath casy looked up at her for a moment the rasping breath came louder and more unevenly our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name glory shouted granma thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth a it is in heaven amen a long gasping sigh came from the open mouth and then a cry release of air give u this day our daily bread and forgive u the breathing had stopped casy looked down into grampa s eye and they were clear and deep and penetrating and there wa a knowing serene look in them hallelujah said granma go on amen said casy granma wa still then and outside the tent all the noise had stopped a car wiiished by on the highway casy still knelt on the floor beside the mattress the people outside were listening standing quietly intent on the sound of dying sairy took granma by the arm and led her outside and granma moved with dignity and held her head high she walked for the family and held her head straight for the family sairy took her to a mattress lying on the ground and sat her down on it and granma looked straight ahead proudly for she wa on show now the tent wa still and at last casy spread the tent flap with his hand and stepped out pa asked softly what w r a it stroke said casy a good quick stroke life began to move again the sun touched the horizon and flattened over it and along the highway there came a the grape of wrath long line of huge freight truck with red side they rum bled along putting a little earthquake in the ground and the standing exhaust pipe sputtered blue smoke from the diesel oil one man drove each truck and his relief man slept in a bunk high up against the ceiling but the truck never stopped they thundered day and night and the ground shook under their heavy march the family became a unit pa squatted down on the ground and uncle john beside him pa wa the head of the family now ma stood behind him noah and tom and a squatted and the preacher sat down and then reclined on his elbow connie and rose of sharon walked at a distance now ruthie and winfield clattering up with a bucket of water held between them felt the change and they slowed up and set down the bucket and moved quietly to stand with ma granma sat proudly coldly until the group wa formed until no one looked at her and then she lay down and cov ered her face with her arm the red sun set and left a shin ing twilight on the land so that face were bright in the evening and eye shone in reflection of the sky the evening picked up light where it could pa said it wa in mr wilson s tent uncle john nodded he loaned his tent fine friendly folk pa said softly wilson stood by his broken car and sairy had gone to the mattress to sit beside granma but sairy wa careful not to touch her pa called mr wilson the man scuffed

texola there s the border and oklahoma wa behind and this day the car crawled on and on through the panhandle of texas shamrock and alanreed groom and yarnell then went through amarillo in the evening drove too long and camped when it wa dusk they were tired and dusty and hot granma had convulsion from the heat and she wa weak when they stopped that night ai stole a fence rail and made a ridge pole on the truck braced at both end that night they ate nothing but pan biscuit cold and hard held over from breakfast they flopped down on the mattress and slept in their clothes the wilson didn t even put up their tent joads and wilson were in flight across the panhandle the rolling gray country lined and cut with old flood scar they were in flight out of oklahoma and across texas the land turtle crawled through the dust and the sun whipped the earth and in the evening the heat went out of the sky and the earth sent up a wave of heat from itself two day the family were in flight but on the third the land wa too huge for them and they settled into a new tech nique of living the highway became their home and move ment their medium of expression little by little they settled into the new life ruthie and winfield first then ai then the grape of wrath connie and rose of sharon and last the older one the land rolled like great stationary ground swell wildorado and vega and boise and glenrio that s the end of texas new mexico and the mountain in the far distance waved up against the sky the mountain stood and the wheel of the car creaked around and the engine were hot and the steam spurted around the radiator cap they crawled to the pecos river and crossed at santa rosa and they went on for twenty mile a joad drove the touring car and his mother sat beside him and rose of sharon beside her ahead the truck crawled the hot air folded in wave over the land and the mountain shivered in the heat a drove listlessly hunched back in the seat his hand hooked easily over the

her hand in her lap had retired into a resistance against weariness she sat loosely letting the movement of the car sway her body and her head she squinted her eye ahead at the mountain rose of sharon wa braced against the movement of the car her foot pushed tight against the floor and her right elbow hooked over the door and her plump face wa tight against the movement and her head jiggled sharply because her neck muscle were tight she tried to arch her whole body a a rigid container to preserve her fetus from shock she turned her head to ward her mother ma she said ma s eye lighted up and she drew her at tention toward rose of sharon her eye went over the tight tired plump face and she smiled ma the girl said when the grape of wrath we get there all you gon na pick fruit an klnda live in

engaged tom took them up little by little until the pan settled evenly in against the gasket and he tightened hard against the nut u i guess that s her tom said he tightened the oil tap looked carefully up at the pan and took the light and searched the ground there she is le s get the oil back in her they crawled out and poured the bucket of oil back in the crank case tom inspected the gasket for leak o k al turn her over he said a got into the car and stepped on the starter the motor caught with a roar blue smoke poured from the exhaust pipe throttle down tom shouted she ll burn

he bounced along ahead cruising easily his great ear flopping with every jump now and then he tried to break off the road but the wall of darkness thrust him back far ahead bright headlight appeared and bore down on them the rabbit hesitated fal tered then turned and bolted toward the lesser light of the dodge there wa a small soft jolt a he went under the wheel the oncoming car swished by we

dominated the camp ground and on the porch of the house a gasoline lantern hissed and threw it white glare in a great circle half a dozen tent were pitched near the house and car stood beside the tent cook ing for the night wa over but the coal of the campfire still glowed on the ground by the camping place a group of men had gathered to the porch where the lantern burned and their face were strong and muscled under the harsh white light light that threw black shadow of their hat over their forehead and eye and made their chin seem to jut out they sat on the step and some stood on the ground resting their elbow on the porch floor the proprietor a sullen lanky man sat in a chair on the porch he leaned back against the wall and he drummed his finger on his knee in side the house a kerosene lamp burned but it thin light wa blasted by the hissing glare of the gasoline lantern the gathering of men surrounded the proprietor tom drove the dodge to the side of the road and parked a drove

on the high porch their eye glittered under the harsh light of the gas lantern their face were hard in the hard light and they were very still only their eye moved from speaker to speaker and their face were expressionless and quiet a lamp bug slammed into the lantern and broke itself and fell into the darkness in one of the tent a child wailed in complaint and a woman s soft voice soothed it and then broke into a low song jesus love you in the night sleep good sleep good jesus watch in the night sleep oh sleep oh the lantern hissed on the porch the owner scratched in the v of his open shirt where a tangle of white chest hair showed he wa watchful and ringed with trouble he watched the men in the circle watched for some expression and they made no move tom wa silent for a long time

into the road iknd he listened closely to the motor a it turned over listened for knock the road spread dimly under the weak light of the car chapter seventeen t he car of the migrant people crawled out of the side road onto the great cross country highway and they took the migrant way to the west in the day light they scuttled like bug to the westward and a the dark caught them they clustered like bug near to shelter and to water and because they were lonely and perplexed because they had all come from a place of sadness and worry and defeat and because they were all going to a new mysterious place they huddled together they talked together they shared their life their food and the thing they hoped for in the new country thus it might be that one family camped near a spring and another camped for the spring and for company and a third because two family had pioneered the place and found it good and when the sun went down per hap twenty family and twenty car were there in the evening a strange thing happened the twenty fami lie became one family the child were the child of all the loss of home became one loss and the golden time in the west wa one dream and it might be that a sick child threw despair into the heart of twenty family of a hundred peo ple that a birth there in a tent kept a hundred people quiet and awestruck through the night and filled a hundred people with the birth joy in the morning a family which the night defore had been lost and fearful might search it good to find a present for a new baby in the evening sitting about the grape of wrath the fire the twenty were one they grew to be unit of the camp unit of the evening and the night a guitar un wrapped from a blanket and tuned and the song which were all of the people were sung in the night men sang the word and woman hummed the tune every night a world created complete with furniture friend made and enemy established a world complete with braggart and with coward with quiet men with humble men with kindly men every night relationship that make a world established and every morning the world torn down like a circus at first the family were timid in the building and tum bling world but gradually the technique of building world became their technique then leader emerged then law were made then code came into being and a the world moved westward they were more complete and better fur nished for their builder were more experienced in building them the family learned what right must be observed the right of privacy in the tent the right to keep the past black hidden in the heart the right to talk and to listen the right to refuse help or to accept to offer help or to decline it the right of son to court and daughter to be courted the right of the hungry to be fed the right of the pregnant and the sick to transcend all other right and the family learned although no one told them what right are monstrous and must be destroyed the right to intrude upon privacy the right to be noisy while the camp slept the right of seduction or rape the right of adultery and theft and murder these right were crashed because the little world could not exist for even a night with such right alive the grape of wrath and a the world moved westward rule became law although no one told the family it is unlawful to foul near the camp it is unlawful in any way to foul the drinking water it is unlawful to eat good rich food near one who is hungry unless he is asked to share and with the law the punishment and there were only two a quick and murderous fight or ostracism and ostra cism wa the worst for if one broke the law his name and face went with him and he had no place in any world no matter where created in the world social conduct became fixed and rigid so that a man must say good morning when asked for it so that a man might have a willing girl if he stayed with her if he fathered her child and protected them but a man might not have one girl one night and another the next for this would endanger the world the family moved westward and the technique of build ing the world improved so that the people could be safe in their world and the form wa so fixed that a family acting in the rule knew it wa safe in the rule there grew up government in the world with leader with elder a man who wa wise found that his wisdom wa needed in every camp a man who wa a fool could not change his folly with his world and a kind of insurance de veloped in these night a man with food fed a hungry man and thus insured himself against hunger and when a baby died a pile of silver coin grew at the door flap for a baby must be well buried since it ha had nothing else of life an old man may be left in a potter s field but not a baby a certain physical pattern is needed for the building of a world water a river bank a stream a spring or even a faucet unguarded and there is needed enough flat land to the grape of wrath pitch the tent a little brush or wood to build the fire if there is a garbage dump not too far off all the better for there can be found equipment stove top a curved fender to shelter the fire and can to cook in and to eat from and the world were built in the evening the people moving in from the highway made them with their tent and their heart and their brain in the morning the tent came down the canvas wa folded the tent pole tied along the running board the bed put in place on the car the pot in their place and a the family moved westward the technique of building up a home in the evening and tearing it down with the morning light became fixed so that the folded tent wa packed in one place the cooking pot counted in their box and a the car moved westward each member of the family grew into his proper place grew into his duty so that each member old and young had his place in the car so that in the weary hot evening when the car pulled into the camping place each member had his duty and went to it without instruction child to gather wood to carry water men to pitch the tent and bring down the bed woman to cook the supper and to watch while the family fed and this wa done with out command the family which had been unit of which the boundary were a house at night a farm by day changed their boundary in the long hot light they were silent in the car moving slowly westward but at night they integrated with any group they found thus they changed their social life changed a in the whole universe only man can change they were not farm men any more but migrant men and the thought the plan ning the long staring silence that had gone out to the field went now to the road to the distance to the west that the grape of wrath man whose mind had been bound with acre lived with nar row concrete mile and his thought and his worry were nor any more with rainfall with wind and dust with the thrust of the crop eye watched the tire ear listened to the clat tering motor and mind struggled with oil with gasoline with the thinning rubber between air and road then a broken gear wa tragedy then water in the evening wa the yearning and food over the fire then health to go on wa the need and strength to go on and spirit to go on the will thrust westward ahead of them and fear that had once apprehended drought or flood now lingered with anything that might stop the westward crawling the camp became fixed each a short day s journey from d e last and on the road the panic overcame some of the family so that they drove night and day stopped to sleep in the car and drove on to the west flying from the road flying from movement and these lusted so greatly to be settled that they set their face into the west and drove toward it forcing the clashing engine over the road but most of the family changed and grew quickly into the new life and when the sun went down time to look out for a place to stop and there s some tent ahead the car pulled off the road and stopped and because others were there first certain courtesy were necessary and the man the leader of the family leaned from the car can we pull up here an sleep why sure be proud to have you what state you from come all the way from arkansas they s arkansas people down that fourth tent that so w the grape of wrath and the great question how s the water well she don t taste so good but they s plenty weil thank ya no thanks to me but the courtesy had to be the car lumbered over the ground to the end tent and stopped then down from the car the weary people climbed and stretched stiff body then the new tent sprang up the child went for water and the older boy cut brush or wood the fire started and supper wa put on to boil or to fry early comer moved over and state were exchanged and friend and sometimes relative discovered oklahoma huh what county cherokee why i got folk there know the allen they s allen all over cherokee know the willis why sure and a new unit wa formed the dusk came but before the dark wa down the new family wa of the

the spring and young girl found each other and boasted shyly of their popularity and their prospect the woman worked over the fire hurrying to get food to the stomach of the family pork if there wa money in plenty pork and pota toe and onion dutch oven biscuit or cornbread and plenty of gravy to go over it side meat or chop and a can of boiled tea black and bitter fried dough in dripping if money wa slim dough fried crisp and brown and the drip ping poured over it those family which were very rich or very foolish with their money ate canned bean and canned peach and pack aged bread and bakery cake but they ate secretly in their tent for it would not have been good to eat such fine thing openly even so child eating their fried dough smelled the warming bean and were unhappy about it when supper wa over and the dish dipped and wiped the dark had come and then the men squatted down to talk the grape of wrath and they talked of the land behind them i don know what it s coming to they said the country s spoilt it come back though on y we won t be there maybe they thought maybe we sinned some way we didn t know about fella say to me gov ment fella an he say she s gullied up on

it ll be fine won t have no cold in the winter kid won t freeze on the way to school i m the grape of wrath take care my bid don t miss no more school i can read good but it ain t no pleasure to me like with a fella that s used to it and perhaps a man brought out his guitar to the front of his tent and he sat on a box to play and everyone in the camp moved slowly in toward him drawn in toward him many men can chord a guitar but perhaps this man wa a picker there you have something the deep chord beating beating while the melody run on the string like little foot step heavy hard finger marching on the fret the man played and the people moved slowly in on him until the cir cle wa closed and tight and then he sang ten cent cotton and forty cent meat and the circle sang softly with him and he sang why do you cut your hair girl and the circle sang he wailed the song i m leaving old texas that eerie song that wa sung before the spaniard came only the word were indian then and now the group w r a welded to one thing one unit so that in the dark the eye of the people were inward and their mind played in other time and their sadness wa like rest like sleep he sang the mcalester blue and then to make up for it to the older people he sang jesus call me to his side the child drowsed with the music and went into the tent to sleep and the singing came into their dream and after a while the man with the guitar stood up and yawned good night folk he said and they murmured good night to you and each wished he could pick a guitar because it is a gracious thing then the people went to their bed and the camp wa quiet and the owl coasted overhead and the coyote gabbled in the distance and into the camp skunk walked looking for bit of food waddling arrogant skunk afraid of nothing the grape of wrath the night passed and with the first streak of dawn the woman came out of the tent built up the fire and put the coffee to boil and the men came out and talked softly in the dawn when you cross the colorado river there s the desert they say look out for the desert see you don t get hung up take plenty water case you get hung up fm gon na take her at night me too she ll cut the living jesus outa you the family ate quickly and the dish were dipped and wiped the tent came down there wa a rush to go and when the sun arose the camping place wa vacant only a little litter left by the people and the camping place wa ready for a new world in a new night but along the highway the car of the migrant people crawled out like bug and the narrow concrete mile stretched ahead chapter eighteen t he joad family moved slowly westward up into the mountain of new mexico past the pinnacle and pyramid of the upland they climbed into the high country of arizona and through a gap they looked down on the painted desert a border guard stopped them where you going to california said tom how long you plan to be in x rizona no longer n we can get acrost her got any plant no plant i

rocky country and ahead were jagged broken peak the western wall of ari zona and now they were in flight from the sun and the the grape of wrath drought they drove all night and came to the mountain in the night and they crawled the jagged rampart in the night and their dim light flickered on the pale stone wall of the road they passed the summit in the dark and came slowly down in the late night through the shattered stone debris of oatman and when the daylight came they saw the colorado river below them they drove to topock pulled up at the bridge while a guard washed off the windshield sticker then across the bridge and into the broken rock wilderness and although they were dead weary and the morning heat wa growing they stopped pa called we re there we re in california they looked dully at the broken rock glaring under the sun and across the river the terrible rampart of arizona we got the desert said tom we got to get to the water and rest the road run parallel to the river and it wa well into the morning when the burning motor came to needle where the river run swiftly among the reed the joads and wilson drove to the river and they sat in the car looking at the lovely water flowing by and the green reed jerking slowly in the current there wa a little encampment by the river eleven tent near the water and the swamp grass on the ground and tom leaned out of truck

i d jus fly all apart from some little distance there came the sound of the beginning meeting a sing song chant of exhortation the word were not clear only the tone the voice rose and fell and went higher at each rise now a response filled in the pause and the exhortation went up with a tone of triumph and a growl of power came into the voice it swelled and paused and a growl came into the response and now gradu ally the sentence of exhortation shortened grew sharper like command and into the response came a complaining note the rhythm quickened male and female voice had been one tone but now in the middle of a response one woman s voice went up and up in a wailing cry wild and fierce like the cry of a beast and a deeper woman s voice the grape of wrath rose up beside it a baying voice and a man s voice traveled up the scale in the howl of a wolf the exhortation stopped and only the feral howling came from the tent and with it a thudding sound on the earth ma shivered rose of sharon s breath wa panting and short and the chorus of howl went on so long it seemed that lung must burst ma said make me nervous somepin happened to me now the high voice broke into hysteria the gabbling scream of a hyena the thudding became louder voice cracked and broke and then the whole chorus fell to a sob bing grunting undertone and the slap of flesh and the thud ding on the earth and the sobbing changed to a littk whining like that of a litter of puppy at a food dish rose of sharon cried softly with nervousness granina kicked the curtain off her leg which lay like gray knotted stick and granma whined with the whining in the distance ma pulled the curtain back in place and then granma sighed deeply and her breathing grew steady and easy and her closed eyelid ceased their flicking she slept deeply and snored through her half open mouth the whining from the distance wa softer and softer until it could not be heard at all any more rose of sharon looked at ma and her eye were blank with tear it done good said rose of sharon it done granma good she s a sleepin ma s head wa down and she wa ashamed maybe i done them good people wrong granma is asleep whyn t you ast our

breathing she moved a hand to start a fly from her forehead the camp wa quiet in the blinding heat but the noise of hot grass of cricket the hum of fly were a tone that wa close to silence ma sighed deeply and then yawned and closed her eye in her half sleep she heard footstep approaching but it wa a man s voice that started her awake who s in here ma sat up quickly a brown faced man bent over and looked in he wore boot and khaki pant and a khaki shirt with epaulet on a sam browne belt a pistol holster hung the grape of wrath and a big silver star wa pinned to his shirt at the left breast a

skillet in the utensil box she sat down slowly rose of sharon watched her secretly and when she saw ma fighting with her face rose of sharon closed her eye and pretended to be asleep the sun sank low in the afternoon but the heat did not seem to decrease tom awakened under his willow and his mouth wa parched and his body wa wet with sweat and his head wa dissatisfied with his rest he staggered to his foot and walked toward the water he peeled off his clothes and waded into the stream and the moment the water wa about him his thirst wa gone he lay back in the shallow and his body floated he held himself in place with his elbow in the sand and looked at his toe which bobbed above the surface a pale skinny little boy crept like an animal through the reed and slipped off his clothes and he squirmed into the water like a muskrat and pulled himself along like a muskrat only his eye and nose above the surface then suddenly he saw tom s head and saw that tom wa watching him he stopped his game and sat up tom said hello lo look like you wa playin mushrat well i wa he edged gradually away toward the bank he moved casually and then he leaped out gathered his clothes with a sweep of his arm and wa gone among the willow tom laughed quietly and then he heard his name called the grape of wrath shrilly tom oh tom he sat up in the water and whis tled through his teeth a piercing whistle with a loop on the end the willow shook and ruthie stood looking at him ma want you she said ma want you right away awright he stood up and strode through the water to the shore and ruthie looked with interest and amazement at his naked body tom seeing the direction of her eye said run on now git and ruthie ran tom heard her calling excitedly for winfield a she went he put the hot clothes on his

level ma emptied the quarter of a keg of salt pork into a pan and tom and a took both little barrel to the river and washed them they tied them to the running board and carried water in bucket to fill

tossing the hot potato from hand to hand until they cooled ma went to the wilson tent and stayed for ten minute and then she came out quietly it s time to go she said the men went under the tarpaulin granma still slept her mouth wide open they lifted the whole mattress gently and passed it up on top of the truck granma drew up her skinny leg and frowned in her sleep but she did not awaken uncle john and pa tied the tarpaulin over the cross piece making a little tight tent on top of the load they lashed it down to the side bar and then they were ready pa took out his purse and dug two crushed bill from it he went to wilson and held them out we want you should take this an he pointed to the pork and potato an that wilson hung his head and shook it sharply i ain a gon na do it he said you

beside granma tom and a and pa in the seat and winfield on pa s lap connie and rose of sharon made a nest against the cab the preacher and uncle john and ruthie were in a tangle on the load pa called good by mister and mi wilson there wa no answer from the tent tom started the engine and the i road toward needle and the highway ma looked back wil son stood in front of his tent staring after them and his hat wa in his hand the sun fell full on his face ma waved her hand at him but he did not respond tom kept the track in second gear over the rough road to protect the spring at needle he drove into a service station checked the worn tire for air checked the spare tied to the back he had the gas tank filled and he bought two five gallon can of gasoline and a t wo gallon can of oil he filled the radiator begged a map and studied it the service station boy in his white uniform seemed un the grape of wrath easy until the bill wa paid he said you people sure have got nerve tom looked up from

better they don t know any bet ter and he wiped the sweat from the pink bill with his sleeve the truck took the road and moved up the long hill through the broken rotten rock the engine boiled very soon and tom slowed down and took it easy up the long slope winding and twisting through dead country burned white and gray and no hint of life in it once tom stopped for a few moment to let the engine cool and then he trav eled on they topped the pas while the sun wa still up and looked down on the desert black cinder mountain in the distance and the yellow sun reflected on the gray desert the little starved bush sage and greasewood threw bold shadow on the sand and bit of rock the glaring sun wa straight ahead tom held his hand before his eye to see at all they passed the crest and coasted down to cool the engine they coasted down the long sweep to the floor of the desert and the fan turned over to cool the water in the radiator in the driver s seat tom and a and pa and winfield on pa s knee looked into the bright descending sun and their eye were stony and their brown face were damp with perspiration the burnt land and the black cindery hill broke the even distance and made it terrible in the reddening light of the setting sun a said jesus what a place how d you like to walk acrost her people done it said tom lot a people done it an if they could we could lot must a died said al the grape of wrath weil we ain t come out exac ly clean a wa silent for a while and the reddening desert swept past think we ll ever see them wilson again a asked tom flicked his eye down to

to see pretty country the sun went down and left a great halo in the sky and it grew very dark under the tarpaulin a long cave with light at each end a flat triangle of light connie and rose of sharon leaned back against the cab and the hot wind tumbling through the tent struck the back of their head and the tarpaulin whipped and drummed the grape of wrath above them they spoke together in low tone pitched to the drumming canvas so that no one could hear them when connie spoke he turned his head and spoke into her ear and she did the same to him she said seems like we wasn t never gon na do nothin but move i m so tar d he turned his head to her ear maybe in the momin how d you like to be alone now in the dusk his hand moved out and stroked her hip she said don t you ll make me crazy a a

a beating flailing heat but now the heat came from below from the earth itself and the heat wa thick and muffling the light of the truck came on and they illuminated a little blur of highway ahead and a strip of desert on either side of the road and sometimes eye gleamed in the light far ahead but no animal showed in the light it wa pitch dark under the canvas now uncle john and the preacher were curled in the middle of the truck rest ing on their elbow and staring out the back triangle they could see the two bump that were ma and granma against the outside they could see ma move occasionally

earth and the hour passed ruthie and winfield went to sleep connie loosened a blanket from the load and covered himself and rose of sharon with it and in the heat they struggled together and held their breath and after a time connie threw off the the grape of wrath blanket and the hot tunneling wind felt cool on their wet body on the back of the truck ma lay on the mattress beside granina and she could not see with her eye but she could feel the struggling body and the struggling heart and the sobbing breath wa in her ear and ma said over and over all right it s gon na be all right and she said hoarsely you know the family got to get acrost you know that uncle john called you all right it wa a moment before she answered all right guess dropped off to sleep and after a time granma wa still and ma lay rigid beside her the night hour passed and the dark wa in against the truck sometimes car passed them going west and away and sometimes great truck came up out of the west and rumbled eastward and the star flowed down in a slow ca cade over the western horizon it wa near midnight when they neared daggett where the inspection station is the road wa floodlighted there and a sign illuminated keep right and stop the officer loafed in the office but they came out and stood under the long covered shed when tom pulled in one officer put down the license number and raised the hood tom asked what s this here agricultural inspection we got to look over your stuff got any vegetable or seed no said tom well we got to look over your stuff you got to unload now ma climbed heavily

little heliograph far away ruthie and winfield looked at it and ruthie whispered it s california winfield moved his lip silently over the syllable there s fruit he said aloud casy and uncle john connie and rose of sharon climbed down and they stood silently rose of sharon had started ro brush her hair back when she caught sight of the valley and her hand dropped slowly to her side tom said where s ma i want ma to see it look ma come here ma ma wa climbing slowly stiffly down the back board tom looked at her my god ma you sick her face wa stiff and putty like and her eye seemed to have

again and the hot breath of the valley came up to them with hot green smell on it and with resinous sage and tarweed smell the the grape of wrath cricket crackled along the road a rattlesnake crawled across the road and tom hit it and broke it and left it squirming tom said i guess we got to go to the coroner wherever lie is we got to get her buried decent how much money might be lef pa w bout forty dollar said pa tom laughed jesus are we gon na start clean we sure ain t bringin nothin with u he chuckled a moment and then his face straightened quickly he pulled the visor of his cap down low over his eye and the truck rolled down the mountain into the great valley chapter nineteen o nce california belonged to mexico and it land to mexican and a horde of tattered feverish ameri can poured in and such wa their hunger for land that they took the land stole sutter s land guerrero s land took the grant and broke them up and growled and quar reled over them those frantic hungry men and they guarded with gun the land they had stolen they put up house and barn they turned the earth and planted crop and these thing were possession and possession wa ownership the mexican were weak and fed they could not resist because they wanted nothing in the world a frantically a the american wanted land then with time the squatter were no longer squatter but owner and their child grew up and had child on the land and the hunger wa gone from them the feral hun ger the gnawing tearing hunger for land for water and earth and the good sky over it for the green thrusting grass for the swelling root they had these thing so completely that they did not know about them any more they had no more the stomach tearing lust for a rich acre and a shining blade to plow it for seed and a windmill beating it wing in the air they arose in the dark no more to hear the sleepy bird first chittering and the morning wind around the house while they waited for the first light to go out to the dear acre these thing were lost and crop were reckoned i the grape of wrath in dollar and land wa valued by principal plus interest and crop were bought and sold before they were planted then crop failure drought and flood were no longer little death within life but simple loss of money and all their love wa thinned with money and all their fierceness dribbled away in interest until they were no longer farmer at all but little shopkeeper of crop little manufacturer who must sell before they can make then those farmer who were not good shopkeeper lost their land to good shopkeeper no matter how clever how loving a man might be with earth and growing thing he could not survive if he were not also a good shopkeeper and a time went on the busi ness men had the farm and the farm grew larger but there were fewer of them now farming became industry and the owner followed rome although they did not know it they imported slave although they did not call them slave chinese japanese mexican filipino they live on rice and bean the business men said they don t need much they wouldn t know what to do with good wage why look how they live why look what they eat and if they get funny deport them and all the time the farm grew larger and the owner fewer and there were pitifully few farmer on the land any more and the imported serf were beaten and frightened and starved until some went home again and some grew fierce and were killed or driven from the country and the farm grew larger and the owner fewer and the crop changed fruit tree took the place of grain field and vegetable to feed the world spread out on the bottom lettuce cauliflower artichoke potato stoop crop a man may stand to use a scythe a plow a pitchfork but he must crawl like a bug between the row of lettuce he the grape of wrath must bend his back and pull his long bag between the cotton row he must go on his knee like a penitent across a cauli flower patch and it came about that owner no longer worked on their farm they farmed on paper and they forgot the land the smell the feel of it and remembered only that they owned it remembered only what they gained and lost by it and some of the farm grew so large that one man could not even conceive of them any more so large that it took batter y of bookkeeper to keep track of interest and gain and loss chemist to test the soil to replenish straw boss to see that the stooping men were moving along the row a swiftly a the material of their body could stand then such a farmer really became a storekeeper and kept a store he paid the men and sold them food and took the money back and after a while he did not pay the men at all and saved book keeping these farm gave food on credit a man might work and feed himself and when the work wa done he might find that he owed money to the company and the owner not only did not work the farm any more many of them had never seen the farm they owned and then the dispossessed were drawn west from kansa oklahoma texas new mexico from nevada and arkansas family tribe dusted out tractored out carload caravan homeless and hungry twenty thousand and fifty thousand and a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand they streamed oyer the mountain hungry and restless restless a ant scurrying to find work to do to lift to push to pull to pick to cut anything any burden to bear for food the kid are hungry we got no place to live like ant scurrying for work for food and most of all for land we ain t foreign seven generation back american and the grape of wrath beyond that irish scotch english german one of our folk in the revolution an they wa lot of our folk in the civil war both side american they were hungry and they were fierce and they had hoped to find a home and they found only hatred okies the owner hated them because the owner knew they were soft and the ky strong that they were fed and the okies hungry nd perhaps the owner had heard from their grand father how easy it is to steal land from a soft man if you are fierce and hungry and armed the owner hated them and in the town the storekeeper hated them because they had no money to spend there is no shorter path to a store keeper s contempt and all his admiration are exactly oppo site the town men little banker hated okies because there wa nothing to gain from them they had nothing and the laboring people hated okies because a hungry man must work and if he must work if he ha to work the wage payer automatically give him less for his work and then no one can get more and the dispossessed the migrant flowed into california two hundred and fifty thousand and three hundred thou sand behind them new tractor were going on the land and the tenant were being forced off and new wave were on the way new wave of the dispossessed and the homeless hardened intent and dangerous and while the californian wanted many thing accumu lation social success amusement luxury and a curious bank ing security the new barbarian wanted only two thing iand and food and to them the two were one and whereas the want of the californian were nebulous and undefined the want of the okies were beside the road lying there to be seen and coveted the good field with water to be dug the grape of wrath for the good green field earth to crumble experimentally m the hand grass to smell oaten stalk to chew until the sharp sweetness wa in the throat a man might look at a fallow field and know and see in his mind that his own bend ing back and his own straining arm would bring the cab bages into the light and the golden eating corn the turnip and carrot and a homeless hungry man driving the road with his wife beside him and his thin child in the back seat could look at the fallow field which might produce food but not profit and that man could know how a fallow field is a sin and the unused land a crime against the thin child and such a man drove along the road and knew temptation at every field and knew the lust to take these field and make them grow strength for his child and a little comfort for his wife the temptation wa before him always the field goaded him and the company ditch with good water flow ing were a goad to him and in the south he saw the golden orange hanging on the tree the little golden orange on the dark green tree and guard with shotgun patrolling the line so a man might not pick an orange for a thin child orange to be dumped if the price wa low he drove his old car into a town he scoured the farm for work where can we sleep the night well there s hooverville on the edge of the river there s a whole raft of okies there he drove his old car to hooverville he never asked again for there wa a hooverville on the edge of every town the rag town lay close to water and the house were tent and weed thatched enclosure paper house a great junk pile the man drove his family in and became a citizen the grape of wrath of hooverville always they were called hooverville the man put up his own tent a near to water a he could get or if he had no tent he went to the city dump and brought back carton and built a house of corrugated paper and when the rain came the house melted and washed away he settled in hooverville and he scoured the countryside for work and the little money he had went for gasoline to look for work in the evening the men gathered and talked to gether squatting on their ham they talked of the land they had seen there s thirty thousan acre out west of here layin there jesus what i could do with that with five acre of that why hell i d have ever thing to eat notice one thing they ain t no vegetable nor chicken nor pig at the farm they raise one thing cotton say or peach or lettuce nother place ll be all chicken they buy the stuff they could raise in the dooryard jesus what i could do with a couple pig well it ain t yourn an it ain t gon na be vourn what we gon na do the kid can t grow up this way in the camp the word would come whispering there s work at shafter and the car would be loaded in the night the highway crowded a gold rush for work at shafter the people would pile up five time too many to do the work a gold rush for work they stole away in the night frantic for work and along the road lay the temptation the field that could bear food that s owned that ain t our n well maybe we could get a little piece of her maybe a little piece right down there a patch jimson weed now christ i could git enough potato off n that little patch to feed my whole family the grape of wrath it ain t our n it got to have jimson weed now and then a man tried crept on the land and cleared a piece trying like a thief to steal a little richness from the earth secret garden hidden in the weed a package of carrot seed and a few turnip planted potato skin crept out in the evening secretly to hoe in the stolen earth leave the weed around the edge then nobody can see what we re a doin leave some weed big tall one in the middle secret gardening in the evening and water carried in a rusty can and then one day a deputy sheriff well what you think you re doin i ain t doin no harm i had my eye on you this ain t your land you re tres passing the land

to pull to push to lift to work for every manload to lift five pair of arm extended to lift it for every stom achful of food available five mouth open and the great owner who must lose their land in an up heaval the great owner with access to history with eye to read history and to know the great fact when property accumulates in too few hand it is taken away and that com panion fact when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need and the little screaming fact that sound through all history repression work only to strengthen and knit the repressed the great owner ignored the three cry of history the land fell into fewer hand the number of the dispossessed increased and every effort of the great owner wa directed at repression the money wa spent for arm for gas to protect the great the grape of wrath holding and spy were sent to catch the murmuring of re j vo lt so that it might be stamped out the changing economy wa ignored plan for the change ignored and only mean to destroy revolt were considered while the cause of revolt went on the tractor which throw men out of work the belt line which carry load the machine which produce all were increased and more and more family scampered on the highway looking for crumb from the great holding lust ing after the land beside the road the great owner formed association for protection and

and they rolled through the street and out toward the country and by a bridge they saw a col lection of tent and shack tom said might s well stop here find out what s doin an where at the work is he drove down a steep dirt incline and parked on the edge of the encampment there wa no order in the camp little gray tent shack car were scattered about at random the first house wa nondescript the south wall wa made of three sheet of rusty corrugated iron the east wall a square of moldy carpet tacked between two board the north wall a strip of roof ing paper and a strip of tattered canvas and the west wall six piece of gunny sacking over the square frame on un the grape of wrath trimmed willow limb grass had been piled not thatched but heaped up in a low mound the entrance on the gunny sack side wa cluttered with equipment a five gallon kero sene can served for a stove it wa laid on it side with a sec tion of rusty stovepipe thrust in one end a wash boiler rested on it side against the wall and a collection of box lay about box to sit on to eat on a model t ford sedan and a two wheel trailer were parked beside the shack and about the camp there hung a slovenly despair next to the shack there wa a little tent gray with weath ering but neatly properly set up and the box in front of it were placed against the tent wall a stovepipe stuck out of the door flap and the dirt in front of the tent had been swept and sprinkled a bucketful of soaking clothes stood on a box the camp wa neat and sturdy a model a roadster and a little home made bed trailer stood beside the tent and next there wa a huge tent ragged torn in strip and the tear mended with piece of wire the flap were up and inside four wide mattress lay on the ground a clothes line strung along the side bore pink

the habit of the road took the grape of wrath down the bucket and walked toward the willow where there would be water and the line of child parted for them and closed after them the flap of the first shack parted and a woman looked out her gray hair wa braided and she wore a dirty flow ered mother hubbard her face wa wizened and dull deep gray pouch under blank eye and a mouth slack and loose pa said can we jus pull up anywheres an camp the head wa withdrawn inside the shack for a moment there wa quiet and then the flap were pushed aside and a bearded man in shirt sleeve stepped out the woman looked out after him but she did not come into the open the bearded man said howdy folk and his restless dark eye jumped to each member of the family and from them to the truck to the equipment pa

flame up under the stew kettle the fire flared and dropped and flared and dropped the child fifteen of them stood silently and watched and when the smell of the cooking stew came to their nose their nose crinkled slightly the sunlight glistened on hair tawny with dust the child were embarrassed to be there but they did not go ma talked quietly to a little girl who stood inside the lusting circle

headed down into the camp it pulled to the center of the camp tom said who s this they don t belong here floyd said i dunno cop maybe the car door opened and a man got out and stood beside the car his companion remained seated now all the squat ting men looked at the newcomer and the conversation wa still and the woman building their fire looked secretly at the shiny car the child moved closer with elaborate circuitousness edging inward in long curve floyd put down his wrench tom stood up a wiped his hand on his trouser the three strolled toward the chev rolet the man who had got out of the car wa dressed in khaki trouser and a flannel shirt he wore a flat brimmed stetson hat a sheaf of paper wa held in his shirt pocket by a little fence of fountain pen and yellow pencil and from his hip pocket protruded a notebook with metal cover he moved to one of the group of squatting men and they looked up at him suspicious and quiet they watched him and did not move the white of their eye showed beneath the iris for they did not raise their head to look tom and a and floyd strolled casually near the man said you men want to work still they looked quietly suspiciously and men from all

his foot for him to trip over the deputy fell heavily and rolled reaching for his gun floyd dodged in and out of sight down the line the deputy fired from the ground a woman in front of a tent screamed and then looked at a hand which had no knuckle the finger hung on string against her palm and the torn flesh wa white and bloodless far down the line floyd came in sight sprinting for the willow the deputy sitting on the ground raised his gun again and then suddenly from the group of men the reverend casy stepped he kicked the deputy in the neck and then stood back a the heavy man crumpled into unconsciousness the motor of the chevrolet roared and it streaked away churning the dust it mounted to the highway and shot away in front of her tent the woman still looked at her shattered hand little droplet of blood began to ooze from the wound and a chuckling hysteria began in her throat i whining laugh that grew louder and higher with each breath the deputy lay on his side his mouth open against th dust tom picked up his automatic pulled out the magazine and threw it into the brush and he ejected the live shell the grape of wrath from the chamber fella like that ain t

walked up the dusty road and crossed the concrete highway to the little grocery store he stood in front of the screen door and looked in the proprietor a little gray man the grape of wrath with an unkempt mustache and watery eye leaned on the counter reading a newspaper his thin arm were bare and he wore a long white apron heaped around and in back of him were mound pyramid wall of canned good he looked up when tom came in and his eye narrowed a though he aimed a shotgun good evening he said run out of something run out of my uncle said tom or he run out or something the gray man looked

field the hooverville lay and the little fire flickered and the lantern shone through the tent somewhere in the camp a guitar sounded slow chord struck without any sequence practice chord tom stopped and listened and then he moved slowly along the side of the road and every few step he stopped to listen again he had gone a quarter of a mile before he heard what he listened for down below the embankment the sound of a thick tuneless voice singing drably tom cocked his head the better to hear and the dull voice sang i ve give my heart to jesus so ihe grape of wrath jesus take me home i ve give my soul to jesus so jesus is my home the song trailed off to a murmur and then stopped tom hurried down from the embankment toward the song after a while he stopped and listened again and the voice wa close this time the same slow tuneless singing oh the night that maggie died she called me to her side an give to me them ol red flannel drawer that maggie wore they wa baggy at the knee tom moved cautiously forward he saw the black form sitting on the ground and he stole near and sat down uncle john tilted the pint and the liquor gurgled out of the neck of the bottle tom said quietly hey

john brushed his hand away clumsily come on tom pleaded come on now uncle john ain t goin go jus tar d gon re ri here ri here tom wa very close he put his fist against the point of uncle john s chin he made a small practice arc twice for distance and then with his shoulder in the swing he hit the chin a delicate perfect blow john s chin snapped up and he fell backwards and tried to sit up again but tom wa kneel ing over him and a john got one elbow up tom hit him again unde john lay still on the ground tom stood up and bending he lifted the loose sagging body and boosted it over his shoulder he staggered under the loose weight john s hanging hand tapped him on the back a he went slowly puffing up the bank to the highway once a car came by and lighted him with the limp man over his shoulder the car slowed for a moment and then roared away tom wa panting when he came back to the hooverviile down from the road and to the joad truck john wa coming to he struggled weakly tom set him gently down on the ground camp had been broken while he wa gone a passed the the grape of wrath bundle up on the track the tarpaulin lay ready to bind over the load a said he sure got a quick start

of the load and she crawled under the tarpaulin and disappeared into the dark cave now the bearded man from the weed shack came timidly to the track he waited about his hand clutched behind his back you gon na leave any stuff a fella could use he asked at last pa said can t think of nothin we ain t got nothin to leave tom asked ain t ya gettin out for a long time the bearded man stared at him no he said at last but they ll bum ya out the unsteady eye dropped to the ground i know they done it before well why the hell don t ya get out the bewildered eye looked up for a moment and then down

tom reached under the seat and brought out a big monkey wrench al you get up behind take this here jus in case if anybody try to climb up let im have it al took the wi mch and climbed up the back

pa said i ain t got nothin in my han you can reach over an get the jack handle said tom i hope to jesus you don need it he stepped on the starter and the clanking flywheel turned over the engine

and immediately a crowd of men swarmed about the track they were armed with pick handle and shotgun they wore trench helmet and some american legion cap one man leaned in the window and the warm smell of whisky preceded him where you think you re goin p he thrust a red face near to tom s face tom stiffened his hand crept down to the floor and felt for the jack handle ma caught his arm and held it power fully tom said well and then his voice took on a servile whine we re stranger here he said we heard about they s work in a place called tulare the grape of wrath well goddamn it you re goln the

moved up the highway tom watched them cross the en trance of the dirt road and continue on in a few moment there came the sound of shout and scream and then a flar ing light arose from the direction of the hooverville the light grew and spread and from the distance came a crack ling sound tom got in the truck again he turned around and ran up the dirt road without light at the highway he turned

timeless eye of a statue tom put out his right hand and touched her on the shoulder he had to and then he withdrew his hand never heard you talk so much in my life he said wasn t never so much reason she said he drove through the side street and cleared the town and then he crossed back at an intersection the sign said he turned south on it chapter twenty one t ihe moving questing people were migrant now i those family which had lived on a little piece of jl land who had lived and died on forty acre had eaten or starved on the produce of forty acre had now the whole west to rove in and they scampered about looking for work and the highway were stream of people and the ditch bank were line of people behind them more were coming the great highway streamed with moving people there in the middle and southwest had lived a simple agrarian folk who had not changed with industry who had not farmed with machine or known the power and danger of machine in private hand they had not grown up in the paradox of industry their sens were still sharp to the ridiculousness of the industrial life and then suddenly the machine pushed them out and they swarmed on the highway the movement changed them the highway the camp along the road the fear of hunger and the hunger itself changed them the child without dinner changed them the endless moving changed them they were migrant and the hostility changed them welded them united them hostility that made the little town group and arm a though to repel an invader squad with pick handle clerk and storekeeper with shotgun guarding the world against their own people the grape of wrath in the west there wa panic when the migrant multiplied on the highway men of property were terrified for their property men who had never been hungry saw the eye of the hungry men who had never wanted anything very much saw the flare of want in the eye of the migrant and the men of the town and of the soft suburban country gathered to defend themselves and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invader bad a a man must do be fore he fight they said these goddamned okies are dirty and ignorant they re degenerate sexual maniac these goddamned okies are thief they ll steal anything they ve got no sense of property right and the latter wa true for how can a man without prop erty know the ache of ownership and the defending people said they bring disease they re filthy we can t have them in the school they re stranger how d you like to have your sister go out with one of em the local people whipped themselves into a mold of ruelty then they formed unit squad and armed them rmed them with club with gas with gun we own the country we can t let these okies get out of hand and the nen who were armed did not own the land but they thought they did and the clerk who drilled at night owned nothing and the little storekeeper possessed only a drawerful of debt but even a debt is something even a job is something the clerk thought i get fifteen dollar a week s pose a goddamn okie would work for twelve and the little store keeper thought how could i compete with a debtless man and the migrant streamed in on the highway and their hunger wa in their eye and their need wa in their eye they had no argument no system nothing but their num bers and their need when there wa work for a man ten the grape of wrath men fought for it fought with a low wage if that fella ll work for thirty cent i ll work for twenty five if he ll take twenty five i ll do it for twenty no me i m hungry i ll work for fifteen i ll work for food the kid you ought to see them little boil like cornin out an they can t run arounk give em some wind fall fruit an they bloated up me i ll work for a little piece of meat and this wa good for wage went down and price stayed up the great owner were glad and they sent our more handbill to bring more people in and wage went down and price stayed up and pretty soon now we ll have serf again and now the great owner and the company invented a new method a great owner bought a cannery and when the peach and the pear were ripe he cut the price of fruit below the cost of raising it and a cannery owner he paid himself a low price for the fruit and kept the price of canned good up and took his profit and the little farmer who owned no cannery lost their farm and they were taken by the great owner the bank and the company who also owned the cannery a time went on there were fewer farm the little farmer moved into town for a while and exhausted their credit exhausted their friend their relative and then they too went on the highway and the road were crowded with men ravenous for work murderous for work and the company the bank worked at their own doom and they did not know it the field were fruitful and starv ing men moved on the road the granary were full and the child of the poor grew up rachitic and the pustule of pellagra swelled on their side the great company did the grape of wrath not know that the line between hunger and anger is a thin line and money that might have gone to wage went for gas for gun for agent and spy for blacklist for drilling on the highway the people moved like ant and searched or work for food and the anger began to ferment chapter twenty two i t wa late when tom joad drove along a country road looking for the weedpatch camp there were few light in the countryside only a sky glare behind showed the direction of bakersfield the truck jiggled slowly along and hunting cat left the road ahead of it at a crossroad there wa a little

row were straight and that there wa no litter about the tent the ground of the street had been swept and sprinkled from the rent came the snore of sleeping people the whole camp buzzed and snorted tom walked slowly he neared num ber four sanitary unit and he looked at it curiously an un painted building low and rough under a roof but open at the side the row of wash tray he saw the joad truck standing near by and went quietly toward it the tarpaulin wa pitched and the camp wa quiet a he drew near a figure moved from the shadow of the truck and came toward him ma said softly that you tom

tail board of the truck he lay down on his back on the wooden floor and he pillowed his head on his crossed hand and his forearm pressed against his ear the night grew cooler tom buttoned his coat over his chest and settled back again the star were clear and sharp over his head it wa still dark when he awakened a small clashing noise brought him up from sleep tom listened and heard again the squeak of iron on iron he moved stiffly and shivered in the morning air the camp still slept tom stood up and looked over the side of the truck the eastern mountain were blue black and a he watched the light stood up faintly behind them colored at the mountain rim with a washed red then growing colder grayer darker a it went up overhead until the grape of wrath at a place near the western horizon it merged with pure night down in the valley the earth wa the lavender gray of dawn the clash of iron sounded again tom looked down the line of tent only a little lighter gray than the ground be side a tent he saw a flash of orange fire seeping from the crack in an old iron stove gray smoke spurted up from a stubby smoke pipe tom climbed over the truck side and dropped to the around he moved slowly toward the stove he saw a girl working about the stove saw that she carried a baby on her crooked arm and that the baby wa nursing it head up under the girl s shirtwaist and the girl moved about poking the fire shifting the rusty stove lid to make a better draft opening the oven door and all the time the baby sucked and the mother shifted it deftly from arm to arm the baby didn t interfere with her work or with the quick graceful ness of her movement and the orange fire licked out of the stove crack and threw flickering reflection on the tent tom moved closer he smelled frying bacon and baking bread from the east the light grew swiftly tom came near to the stove and stretched out his hand to it the girl looked at him and nodded so that her two braid jerked good momin she said and she turned the bacon in the pan the tent flap jerked up and a young man came out and an older man followed him they were dressed in new blue dungaree and in dungaree coat stiff with filler the brass button shining they were sharp faced men and they looked much alike the younger man had a dark stubble beard and the older man a white stubble beard their head and face were wet their hair dripped water stood in drop the grape of wrath on their stiff beard their cheek shone with dampness to gether they stood looking quietly into the lightening east they yawned together and watched the light on the hill rim and then they turned and saw tom morniny the older man said and his face wa neither friendly nor unfriendly homin said tom and homin said the younger man the water slowly dried on their face they came to the stove and warmed their hand at it the girl kept to her work once she set the baby down and tied her braid together in back with a string and the two braid jerked and swung a she worked she set tin cup on a big packing box set tin plate and knife and fork out then she scooped bacon from the deep grease and laid it on a tin platter and the bacon cricked and rustled a it grew crisp she opened the rusty oven door and took out a square pan full of big high biscuit when the smell of the biscuit struck the air both of the men inhaled deeply the younger said kee rist softly now the older man said to tom had your breakfast well no i ain t but my folk is over there they ain t up need the sleep well set down with u then we got plenty thank god why thank ya tom said

both men looked down at their stiff blue clothes and they smiled a little shyly the girl set out the platter of bacon and the brown high biscuit and a bowl of bacon gravy and a pot of coffee and then she squatted down by the box too the baby still nursed it head up under the girl s shirtwaist they filled their plate poured bacon gravy over the bi cuits and sugared their coffee the older man filled his mouth full and he chewed and chewed and gulped and swallowed god almighty it s good he said and he filled his mouth again the younger man said we been eatin good for twelve day now never missed a meal in twelve day none of u workin an gettin our pay an eatin he fell to again almost frantically and refilled his plate they drank the scalding coffee and threw the ground to the earth and filled their cup again there wa color in the light now a reddish gleam the father and son stopped eating they were facing to the east and their face were lighted by the dawn the image of the mountain and the light coming over it were reflected in their eye and then they threw the ground from their cup to the earth and they stood up together got to git goin the older man said the younger turned to tom

wrinkled and twisted she crawled carefully out and stood up her gray eye were clear and calm from sleep and mischief wa not in them tom moved off from the tent and beckoned her to follow and when he

t he migrant people scuttling for work scrabbling to live looked always for pleasure dug for pleasure manufactured pleasure and they were hungry for amusement sometimes amusement lay in speech and they climbed up their life with joke and it came about in the camp along the road on the ditch bank beside the stream under the sycamore that the story teller grew into being so that the people gathered in the low firelight to hear the gifted one and they listened while the tale were told and their participation made the story great wa a recruit against geronimo and the people listened and their quiet eye reflected the dying fire them injun wa cute slick a snake an quiet when they wanted could go through dry leaf an make no rustle try to do that sometimes and the people listened and remembered the crash of dry leaf under their foot come the change of season an the cloud up wrong time ever hear of the army doing anything right give the army ten chance an they ll stumble along took

cause yon spoiled somepin in yaself an you can t never fix it up and the people nodded and perhaps the fire spurted a little light and showed their eye looking in on themselves against the sun with his arm out an he looked big a god the grape of wrath and perhaps a man balanced twenty cent between food and pleasure and he went to a movie in marysville or tulare in cere or mountain view and he

chording delicately for himself and on his second chorus three harmonica and a fiddle joined him from the tent the people streamed toward the platform men in their clean blue denim and woman in their gingham they came near to the platform and then stood quietly waiting their face bright and intent under the light around the reservation there wa a high wire fence and along the fence at interval of fifty foot the guard sat in the grass and waited now the car of the guest began to arrive small farmer and their family migrant from other camp and a each guest came through the gate he mentioned the name of the camper who had invited him the string band took a reel tune up and played loudly for they were not practicing any more in front of their tent the jesus lover sat and watched their face hard and con temptuous they did not speak to one another they watched for sin and their face condemned the whole proceeding at the joad tent ruthie and winfield had bolted what lit tle dinner they had and then they started for the platform ma called them back held up their face with a hand under each chin and looked into their nostril pulled their ear and looked inside and sent them to the sanitary unit to wash their hand once more they dodged around the back of the building and bolted for the platform to stand among the child close packed about the band a finished his dinner and spent half an hour shaving with tom s razor a had a tight fitting w r ool suit and a striped the grape of wrath shirt and he bathed and washed and combed his straight hair back and when the washroom wa vacant for a moment he smiled engagingly at himself in the mirror and he turned and tried to see himself in profile when he smiled he slipped his purple arm band on and put on his tight coat and he rubbed up his yellow shoe with a piece of toilet paper a late bather came in and a hurried out and walked recklessly toward the platform his eye peeled for girl near the dance floor he saw a pretty blond girl

beautiful in california valley in which i the fruit blossom are fragrant pink and white water jl in a shallow sea then the first tendril of the grape swelling from the old gnarled vine cascade down to cover the trunk the full green hill are round and soft a breast and on the level vegetable land are the mile long row of pale green lettuce and the spindly little cauliflower the gray green unearthly artichoke plant and then the leaf break out on the tree and the petal drop from the fruit tree and carpet the earth with pink and white the center of the blossom swell and grow and color cherry and apple peach and pear fig which close the flower in the fruit all california quickens with produce and the fruit grows heavy and the limb bend gradually under the fruit so that little crutch must be placed under them to support the weight behind the fruitfulness are men of understanding and knowledge and skill men who experiment with seed end lessly developing the technique for greater crop of plant whose root will resist the million enemy of the earth the mold the insect the rust the blight these men work carefully and endlessly to perfect the seed the root and there are the men of chemistry who spray the tree against pest who sulphur the grape who cut out disease and rot the grape of wrath mildew and sickness doctor of preventive medicine men at the border who look for fruit fly for japanese beetle men who quarantine the sick tree and root them out and bum them men of knowledge the men who graft the young tree the little vine are the cleverest of all for theirs is a surgeon s job a tender and delicate and these men must have surgeon hand and surgeon heart to slit the bark to place the graft to bind the wound and cover them from the air these are great men along the row the cultivator move tearing the spring grass and turning it under to make a fertile earth breaking the ground to hold the water up near the surface ridging the ground in little pool for the irrigation destroying the weed root that may drink the water away from the tree and all the time the fruit swell and the flower break out in long cluster on the vine and in the growing year the warmth grows and the leaf turn dark green the prune lengthen like little green bird s egg and the limb sag down against the crutch under the weight and the hard little pear take shape and the beginning of the fuzz come out on the peach grape blossom shed their tiny petal and the nard little bead become green button and the button grow heavy the men who work in the field the owner of the little orchard watch and calculate the year is heavy with produce and men are proud for of their knowledge they can make the year heavy they have transformed the world with their knowledge the short lean wheat ha been made big and productive little sour apple have grown large and sweet and that old grape that grew among the tree and fed the bird it tiny fruit ha mothered a thousand variety red and black green and pale pink purple and yellow and each the grape of wrath variety with it own flavor the men who work in the ex perimental farm have made new fruit nectarine and forty kind of plum walnut with paper shell and always they work selecting grafting changing driving themselves driv ing the earth to produce and first the cherry ripen cent and a half a pound hell we can t pick em for that black cherry and red cherry full and sweet and the bird eat half of each cherry and the yellowj ackets buzz into the hole the bird made and on the ground the seed drop and dry with black shred hang ing from them the purple prune soften and sweeten my god we can t pick them and dry and sulphur them we can t pay wage no matter what wage and the purple prune carpet the ground and first the skin wrinkle a little and swarm of fly come to feast and the valley is filled with the odor of sweet decay the meat turn dark and the crop shrivels on the ground and the pear grow yellow and soft five dollar a ton five dollar for forty fifty pound box tree pruned and sprayed orchard cultivated pick the fruit put it in box load the truck deliver the fruit to the cannery forty box for five dollar we can t do it and the yellow fruit fall heavily to the ground and splash on the ground the yel lowj ackets dig into the soft meat and there is a smell of ferment and rot then the grape we can t make good wine people can t buy good wine rip the grape from the vine good grape rotten grape wasp stung grape press stem press dirt and but there s mildew and formic acid in the vat the grape of wrath add sulphur and tannic acid the smell from the ferment is not the rich odor of wine but the smell of decay and chemical oh well it ha alcohol in it anyway they can get drunk the little farmer watched debt creep up on them like the tide they sprayed the tree and sold no crop they pruned and grafted and could not pick the crop and the men of knowledge have worked have considered and the fruit is rotting on the ground and the decaying mash in the wine vat is poisoning the air and taste the wine no grape flavor at all just sulphur and tannic acid and alcohol this little orchard will be a part of a great holding next year for the debt will have choked the owner this vineyard will belong to the bank only the great owner can survive for they own the cannery too and four pear peeled and cut in half cooked and canned still cost fifteen cent and the canned pear do not spoil they will last for year the decay spread over the state and the sweet smell is a great sorrow on the land men who can graft the tree and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hun gry people eat their produce men who have created new fruit in the world can not create a system whereby their fruit may be eaten and the failure hang over the state like a great sorrow the work of the root of the vine of the tree must be destroyed to keep up the price and this is the saddest bitter est thing of all carload of orange dumped on the ground the people came for mile to take the fruit but this could not be how would they buy orange at twenty cent a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up and met with hose squirt kerosene on the orange and they are the grape of wrath angry at the crime angry at the people who have come to take the fruit a million people hungry needing the fruit and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountain and the smell of rot fill the country burn coffee for fuel in the ship burn corn to keep warm it make a hot fire dump potato in the river and place guard along the bank to keep the hungry people from fish ing them out slaughter the pig and bury them and let the putrescence drip down into the earth there is a crime here that go beyond denunciation there is a sorrow here that weeping can not symbolize there is a failure here that topples all our success the fertile earth the straight tree row the sturdy trunk and the ripe fruit and child dying of pellagra must die because a profit can not be taken from an orange and coroner must fill in the certificate died of malnutrition because the food must rot must be forced to rot the people come with net to fish for potato in the river and the guard hold them back they come in rattling car to get the dumped orange but the kerosene is sprayed and they stand still and watch the potato float by listen to the screaming pig being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime watch the mountain of orange slop down to a putrefying ooze and in the eye of the people there is the failure and in the eye of the hungry there is a growing wrath in the soul of the people the grape of wrath are fill ing and growing heavy growing heavy for the vintage chapter twenty six i n the weedpatch camp on an

darkness tom went close to his brother sure you don wanta come with me no i m gon na look aroun like i said o k said tom he turned away and strolled down the street the smoke from the house hung low to the ground and the lantern threw their picture of doorway and win dows into the street on the doorstep people sat and looked out into the darkness tom could see their head turn a their eye followed him down the street at the street end the dirt road continued across a stubble field and the black lump of haycock were visible in the starlight a thin blade of moon wa low in the sky toward the west and the long cloud of the milky way trailed clearly overhead tom s foot sounded softly on the dusty road a dark patch against the yellow stubble he put his hand in his pocket and trudged along toward the main gate an embankment came close to the road tom could hear the whisper of water against the grass in the irrigation ditch he climbed up the bank and looked down on the dark water and saw the stretched re flection of the star the state road wa ahead car light swooping past showed where it wa tom set out again to ward it he could see the high wire gate in the starlight a figure stirred beside the road a voice said hello who is it tom stopped and stood still who are you a man stood up and walked near tom could see the gun in his hand then a flashlight played on his face where you think you re going well i thought i d take a walk any law against k you better walk some other way tom asked can t i even get out of here the grape of wrath not tonight yon can t want to walk back or shall i whistle some help an take you hell said tom it ain t nothin to me if it s gon na cause a mess i don t give a dam sure i ll go back the dark figure relaxed the flash went off ya see it s for

know thought it wa a accident well you better git along back that s o k with me mister he swung about and started back he walked quietly along the road a hundred yard and then he stopped and listened the twittering call of a raccoon sounded near the irrigation ditch and very far away the angry howl of a tied dog tom sat down beside the road and listened he heard the high soft laughter of a night hawk and the stealthy movement of a creeping animal in the stubble he inspected the skyline in both direction dark frame both way nothing to show against now he stood up and walked slowly to the right of the road off into the stubble field and he walked bent down nearly a low a the haycock he moved slowly and stopped occasionally to listen at last he came to the wire fence five strand of taut barbed wire beside the fence he lay on his back moved his head under the lowest strand held the wire up with his hand and slid himself under pushing agaiifet the ground with his foot he wa about to get up when a group of men walked by on the edge of the highway tom waited until they were far po the grape of wrath ahead before he stood up and followed them he watched the side of the road for tent a few automobile went by a stream cut across the field and the highway crossed it on a small concrete bridge tom looked over the side of the bridge in the bottom of the deep ravine he saw a tent and a lantern wa burning inside he watched it for a moment saw the shadow of people against the canvas wall tom climbed a fence and moved down into the ravine through brush and dwarf willow and in the bottom beside a tiny stream he found a trail a man sat on a box in front of the tent evenin tom said who are you well i guess well i m jus goin past know anybody here no i tell you i wa jus goin past

wa a wall of frog sound that merged with silence a high shrill whistle of cricket but through this back ground came other sound faint footstep from the road a crunch of clod up on the bank a little swish of brash down the stream can t really tell if you hear it fool you get nervous casy reassured them we re all nervous can t really tell you hear it tom i hear it said tom yeah i hear it i think they s guy cornin from ever which way we better get outa here the wizened man whispered under the bridge span out that way hate to leave my tent le s go said casy they moved quietly along the edge of the stream the black span wa a cave before them casy bent over and moved through tom behind their foot slipped into the water thirty foot they moved and their breathing echoed the grape of wrath from the curved ceiling then they came out on the other side and straightened up a sharp call there they are two flashlight beam fell on the men caught them blinded them stand where you are the voice came out of the darkness that s him that shiny bastard that s him gasy stared blindly at the light he breathed heavily listen he said you fella don know what you re doin you re helpin to starve kid shut up you red son of a bitch a short heavy man stepped into the light he carried a new white pick handle casy went on you don know what you re a doin the heavy man swung with the pick handle casy dodged down into the swing the heavy club crashed into the side of his head with a dull crunch of bone and casy fell side way out of the light jesus george i think you killed him put the light on him said george serve the son of a bitch right the flashlight beam dropped searched and found casy s crushed head tom looked down at the preacher the light crossed the heavy man s leg and the white new pick handle tom leaped silently he wrenched the club free the first time he knew he had missed and struck a shoulder but the second time his crushing blow found the head and a the heavy man sank down three more blow found his head the light danced about there were shout the sound of running foot crash ing through brush tom stood over the prostrate man and then a club reached his head a glancing blow he felt the stroke like an electric shock and then he wa running along the stream bending low he heard the splash of footstep the grape of wrath following him suddenly he turned and squirmed up into the brush deep into a poison oak thicket and he lay still the footstep came near the light beam glanced along the stream bottom tom wriggled up through the thicket to the top he emerged in an orchard and still he could hear the call the pursuit in the stream bottom he bent low and ran over the cultivated earth the clod slipped and rolled under his foot ahead he saw the bush that bounded the field bush along the edge of an irrigation ditch he slipped through the fence edged in among vine and blackberry bush and then he lay still panting hoarsely he felt his numb face and nose the nose wa crushed and a trickle of blood dripped from his chin he lay still on his stomach until his mind came back and then he crawled slowly over the edge of the ditch he bathed his face in the cool water tore off the tail of his blue shirt and dipped it and held it against his tom cheek and nose the water stung and burned the black cloud had crossed the sky a blob of dark against the star the night wa quiet again tom stepped into the water and felt the bottom drop from under his foot he threshed the two stroke across the ditch and pulled himself heavily up the other bank his clothes clung to him he moved and made a slopping noise his shoe squished then he sat down took off his shoe and emptied them he wrung the bottom of his trouser took off his coat and squeezed the water from it along the highway he saw the dancing beam of the flash light searching the ditch tom put on his shoe and moved cautiously across the stubble field tl e squishing noise no longer came from his shoe he went by instinct toward the other side of the stubble field and at last he came the grape of wrath to the road very cautiously he approached the square of house once a guard thinking he heard a noise called who s there tom dropped and froze to the ground and the flashlight beam passed over him he crept silently to the door of the joad house the door squalled on it hinge and ma s voice calm and steady and wide awake what s that me tom well you better get some sleep a ain t in yet he must a foun a girl go on to sleep she said softly over under the window he found his place and took off his clothes to the skin he lay shivering under his blanket and his torn face awakened from it numbness and his whole head throbbed it wa an hour more before a came in he moved cau tiously near and stepped on tom s wet clothes sh said tom a whispered you awake how d you get wet sh said tom tell you in the momin pa turned on his back and his snoring filled the room with gasp and snort you re col a said sh go to sleep the little square of the window showed gray against the black of the room tom did not sleep the nerve of his wounded face came back to life and throbbed and his cheek bone ached and his broken nose bulged and pulsed with pain that seemed to toss him about to shake him he watched the little square win the grape of wrath dow saw the star slide down over it and drop from sight at interval he heard the footstep of the watchman at last the rooster crowed far away and gradually the window lightened tom touched his swollen face with his fingertip and at his movement a groaned and murmured in his sleep the dawn came finally in the house packed together there wa a sound of movement a crash of breaking stick a little clatter of pan in the graying gloom ma sat up sud denly tom could see her face swollen with sleep she looked at the window for a long moment and then she threw the blanket off and found her dress still sitting down she put it over her head and held her arm up and let the dress slide down to her waist she stood up and pulled the dress down around her ankle then in bare foot she stepped care fully to the window and looked out and while she stared at the growing light her quick finger unbraided her hair and smoothed the strand and braided them up again then she clasped her hand in front of her and stood motionless for a moment her face wa lighted sharply by the window she turned stepped carefully among the mattress and found the lantern the shade screeched up and she lighted the wick pa rolled over and blinked at her she said pa you got more money huh yeah paper wrote for sixty cent well git up an go buy some flour an lard quick now pa yawned maybe the store ain t open make em open it got to get somepin in you fella you got to get out to work pa struggled into his overall and put on his rusty coat he went sluggishly out the door yawning and stretching the grape of wrath the child awakened and watched from under their blanket like mouse pale light filled the room now but color less light before the sun ma glanced at the mattress uncle john wa awake a slept heavily her eye moved to tom for a moment she peered at him and then she moved quickly to him his face wa puffed and blue and the blood wa dried black on his lip and chin the edge of the torn cheek were gathered and tight tom she whispered what s the matter sh he said don t talk loud i got

followed her ruthie looked fiercely about but she went to a corner of the car and put her back in the corner her shame and fierceness were blended i tof her what she done winfield said ma wa putting two chop and some fried potato on a tin plate hush winfief she said they ain t no need to hurt her feeling no more n what they re hurt ruthie s body hurtled across the car she grabbed ma around the

himself in a good position of defense for ruthie would attack him at the first opportunity and he knew it ruthie went quietly heart brokenly to the other side of the car ma put a sheet of newspaper over the tin plate fm a goin now she said ain t you gon na eat nothin yourself uncle john de manded later when i come back i wouldn want nothin now ma walked to the open door she steadied herself down the steep cleared cat walk on the stream side of the boxcar the tent were pitched close together their guy rope crossing one another and the peg of one at the canvas line of the next the light shone through the cloth and all the chimney belched smoke men and woman stood in the doorway talking child ran the grape of wrath feverishly about ma moved majestically down the line of tent here and there she wa recognized a she w r ent by evenin mi joad evenin takin somepin out mi joad they s a frien i m takin back some bread she came at last to the end of the line of tent she stopped and looked back a glow of light wa on the camp and the soft overtone of a multitude of speaker now and then a harsher voice cut through the smell of smoke filled the air someone played a harmonica softly trying for an effect one phrase over and over ma stepped in among the willow beside the stream she moved off the trail and waited silently listening to hear any possible follower a man walked down the trail toward the camp boosting his suspender and buttoning his jean a he went ma sat very still and he passed on without seeing her she waited five minute and then she stood up and crept on up the trail beside the stream she moved quietly so quietly that she could hear the murmur of the water above her soft step on the willow leaf trail and stream swung to the left and then to the right again until they neared the high way in the gray starlight she could see the embankment and the black round hole of the culvert where she always left tom s food she moved forward cautiously thrust her pack age into the hole and took back the empty tin plate which wa left there she crept back among the willow forced her way into a thicket and sat down to wait through the tangle she could see the black hole of the culvert she clasped her knee and sat silently in a few moment the thicket crept to life again the field mouse moved cautiously over the leaf a skunk padded heavily and unself consciously down the the grape of wrath trail carrying a faint effluvium with him and then a wind stirred the willow delicately a though it tested them and a shower of golden leaf coasted down to the ground sud denly a gust boiled in and racked the tree and a cricking downpour of leaf fell ma could feel them on her hair and on her shoulder over the sky a plump black cloud moved erasing the star the fat drop of rain scattered down splashing loudly on the fallen leaf and the cloud moved on and unveiled the star again ma shivered the wind blew past and left the thicket quiet but the rushing of the tree went on down the stream from back at the camp came the thin penetrating tone of a violin feeling about for a tune ma heard a stealthy step among the leaf far to her left and she grew tense she released her knee and strsighteneo her head the better to hear the movement stopped and after a long moment began again a vine rasped harshly on the dry leaf ma saw a dark figure creep into the open and draw near to the culvert the black round hole wa obscured for a moment and then the figure moved back she called softly tom the figure stood still so still so low to the ground that it might have been a stump she called again tom oh tom then the figure moved that you ma right over here she stood up and went to meet him you shouldn of came he said i got to see you tom i got to talk to you it s near the trail he said somebody might come by ain t you got a place tom yeah but if well s pose somebody seen you with me whole fambly d be in a jam i got to tom then come along come quiet he crossed the littb the grape of wrath stream wading carelessly through the water and ma fol lowed him he moved through the brush out into a field on the other side of the thicket and along the plowed ground the blackening stem of the cotton were harsh against the ground and a few fluff of cotton clung to the stem a quarter of a mile they went along the edge of the field and then he turned into the brush again he approached a great mound of wild blackberry bush leaned over and pulled a mat of vine aside you got to crawl in he said ma went down on her hand and knee she felt sand under her and then the black inside of the mound no longer touched her and she felt tom s blanket on the ground he arranged the vine in place again it wa lightless in the cave where are you ma here right here talk soft tom don t worry i been livin like a rabbit some time she heard him unwrap his tin plate pork chop she said and fry potato god awmighty an still warm ma could not see him at all in the blackness but she could hear him chewing tearing at the meat and swallowing it s a pretty good hide out he said ma said uneasily tom ruthie tof about you she heard him gulp ruthie what for well it wasn her fault got in a fight an say her brother ll lick that other girl s brother you know how they do an she tol that her brother killed a man an wa hidin tom wa chuckling with me i wa always gon na get uncle john after em but he never would do it that s jus kid talk ma that s awright no it ain t ma said them kid ll tell it aroun an the grape of wrath then the folk ll hear an they ll tell aroun an pretty soon well they liable to get men out to look jus in case tom you got to go away that s what i said right along i wa always scared some body d see you put stuff in that culvert an then they d watch i know but i wanted you near i wa scared for you i ain t seen you can t see you now how s your face gettin well quick come dost tom let me feel it come dost he crawled near her reaching hand found his head in the black ness and her finger moved down to his nose and then over his left cheek you got a bad scar tom an your nose is all crooked maybe tha s a good thing nobody wouldn t know me maybe if my print wasn t on record i d be glad he went back to his eating hush she said listen it s the wind ma jus the wind the gust poured down the stream and the tree rustled under it passing she crawled close to his voice i wanta touch ya again tom it s like i m blin it s so dark i wanta remember even if it s on y my finger that remember you got to go away tom yeah i knowed it from the start we made purty good she said i been squirreiin money away hoi out your ban tom i got seven dollar here i ain t gon na take ya money he said i ll get long all right hoi out ya hari tom i ain t gon na sleep none if you got no money maybe you got to take a bus or somepin i the grape of wrath want you should go a long way off three four hunderd mile i ain t gon na take it tom she said sternly you take this money you hear me you got no right to cause me pain you ain t playin fair he said i thought maybe you could go to a big city los angeles maybe they wouldn never look for you there hm m he said lookie ma i been all day an all night hidin alone guess who i been thinkin about casy he talked a lot used ta bother me but now i been thinkin what he said an i can remember all of it say one time he went out in the wilderness to find his own soul an he foun he didn have no soul that wa his n say he foun he jus got a little piece of a great big soul say a wilderness ain t no good cause his little piece of a soul wasn t no good less it wa with the rest an wa whole funny how i remember didn think i wa even listenin but i know now a fella ain t no good alone he wa a good man ma said tom went on he spouted out some scripture once an it didn soun like no hell fire scripture he tol it twicet an l remember it say it s from the preacher how s it go tom go two are better than one because they have a good eward for their labor for if they fall the one will lif up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up that s part of her go on ma said go on tom jus a little bit more again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if the grape of wrath one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three fold cord is not quickly broken an that s scripture casy said it wa called it the preacher hush listen on y the wind ma i know the wind an i got to think in ma most of die preachin is about the poor we shall have always with u an if you got nothin why jus fop yom hand an to hell with it you gon na git ice cream on gop plate when you re dead an then this here preacher say two get a better reward for their work torn she said what you aimin to do he wa quiet for a long time i been thinkin how it wa in that gov ment camp how our folk took care a theirselves an if they wa a fight they fixed it theirself an they wasn t no cop wagglin their gun but they wa better order than them cop ever give i been a wonderin why we can t do that all over throw out the cop that ain t our people all work together for our own thing all farm our own lan tom ma repeated what you gon na do what casy done he said but they killed him yeah said tom he didn duck quick enough he wasn doing nothin against the law ma i been thinkin a hell of a lot thinkin about our people livin like pig an the good rich lan layin fallow or maybe one fella with a million acre while a hunderd thousan good farmer is starvin an t i been wonderin if all our folk got together an yelled like them fella yelled only a few of em at the hooper ranch ma said tom they ll drive you an cut you down like they done to young floyd the grape of wrath they gon na drive me anyways they drivin all our people you don t aim to kill nobody tom no i been thinldn long a i m a outlaw anyways maybe i could hell i ain t thought it out clear ma don worry me now don worry me they sat silent in the coal black cave of vine ma said how m i gon na know bout you they might kill ya an i wouldn know they might hurt ya how m i gon na know tom laughed uneasily well maybe like casy say a fella ain t got a soul of his own but on y a piece of a big one an then then what tom then it don matter then i ll be all aroun in the dark i ll be ever where wherever you look wherever they s a fight so hungry people can eat i ll be there wherever they s a cop bearin up a guy i ll be there if casy knowed why i ll be in the way guy yell when they re mad an i ll be in the way kid laugh when they re hungry an they know supper s ready an when our folk eat the stuff they raise an live in the house they build why i ll be there see god i m talkin like casy come of thinkin about him so much seems like i can see him sometimes i don un erstan ma said i don really know me neither said tom it s jus stuff i been thinkin about get thinkin a lot when you ain t movin aroun you got to get back ma you take the money then he wa silent for a moment a wright he said an tom later when it s olowed over you ll come back you ll find u the grape of wrath sure he said now you better go here gim me your hanv he guided her toward the entrance her finger clutched his wrist he swept the vine aside and followed her out go up to the field till you come to a sycamore on the edge an then cut acrost the stream good by good by she said and she walked quickly away her eye were wet and burning but she did not cry her foot step were loud and careless on the leaf a she went through the brush and a she went out of the dim sky the rain began to fall big drop and few splashing on the dry leaf heavily ma stopped and stood still in the dripping thicket she turned about took three step back toward the mound of vine and then she turned quickly and went back toward the boxcar camp she went straight out to the cul vert and climbed up on the road the rain had passed now but the sky wa overcast behind her on the road she heard footstep and she turned nervously the blinking of a dim flashlight played on the road ma turned back and started for home in a moment a man caught up with her politely he kept his light on the ground and did not play it in her face evenin he said ma said howdy look like we might have a little rain i hope not stop the pickin we need the pickin i need the

ruthie and winfield came out of their bed like hermit crab from shell for a moment they were careful they watched to see whether they were still criminal when no one noticed them they grew bold ruthie hopped all the way to the door and back on one foot without touching the wall ma wa pouring flour into a bowl when rose of sharon climbed the cat walk she steadied herself and advanced cau tiously what s a matter she asked why it s news ma cried we re gon na have a little party count a a an aggie wainwright is gon na get mar ried rose of sharon stood perfectly still she looked slowly at al who stood there flustered and embarrassed mr wainwright shouted from the other end of the car i m puttin a fresh dress on aggie i ll be right over rose of sharon turned slowly she went back to the wide door and she crept down the cat walk once on the ground she moved slowly toward the stream and the trail that went beside it she took the way ma had gone earlier into the willow the wind blew more steadily now and the bush whished steadily rose of sharon went down on her knee and crawled deep into the brush the berry vine cut her face and pulled at her hair but she didn t mind only when she felt the bush touching her all over did she stop she the grape of wrath stretched out on her back and she felt the weight of the baby inside of her in the lightless car ma stirred and then she pushed the blanket back and got up at the open door of the car the gray starlight penetrated a little ma walked to the door and stood looking out the star were paling in the east the wind blew softly over the willow thicket and from the little stream came the quiet talking of the water most of the camp wa still asleep but in front of one tent a little fire burned and people were standing about it warming them self ma could see them in the light of the new dancing fire a they stood facing the flame rubbing their hand and then they turned their back and held their hand behind them for a long moment ma looked out and she held her hand clasped in front of her the uneven wind whisked up and passed and a bite of frost wa in the air ma shivered and rubbed her hand together she crept back and fumbled for the match beside the lantern the shade screeched up she lighted the wick watched it bum blue for a moment and then put up it yellow delicately curved ring of light she carried the lantern to the stove and set it down while she broke the brittle dry willow twig into the fire box in a moment the fire wa roaring up the chimney rose of sharon rolled heavily over and sat up til git right up she said whyn t you lay a minute till it warms ma asked no it git ma filled the coffee pot from the bucket and set it on the stove and she put on the frying pan deep with fat to get hot for the pone

waist and they slapped their hand together to warm stiff finger that had to be nimble the dawn colored over the eastern hill and the wide line moved over the row and from the highway the car still

other only so much cotton to pick only so much money to be made they came to the other side of the field and ran to get a new row and now they faced into the wind and they could see the high gray cloud moving over the sky toward the rising sun and more car parked along the roadside and new picker came to be checked in the line of people moved frantically across the field weighed at the end marked their cotton checked the weight into their own book and ran for new row at eleven o clock the field wa picked and the work wa done the wire sided trailer were hooked on behind wire sided truck and they moved out to the highway and drove away to the gin the cotton fluffed out through the chicken wire and little cloud of cotton blew through the air and rag of cotton caught and waved on the

the truck moved along the drop became smaller and closer rain pounded on the cab of the truck so loudly that it could be heard over the pounding of the old worn motor on the truck bed the wainwright and joads spread their cotton bag over their head and shoulder rose of sharon shivered violently against ma s arm and ma cried go faster al rosasharn got a chill got ta get her foot in hot water al

uncle john made trip after trip into the thicket and brought back load of dead wood they piled it near the door until the heap of it nearly reached the ceiling and at last they stopped and walked toward the stove stream of water ran from their hat to their shoulder the edge of their coat dripped and their shoe squished a they walked awright now get off them clothes ma said i got some nice coffee for you fella an you got dry overhalls to put on don stan there the evening came early in the boxcar the family hud dled together listening to the pouring water on the roof chapter twenty nine o ver the high coast mountain and over the valley the gray cloud marched in from the ocean the wind blew fiercely and silently high in the air and it swished in the brush and it roared in the forest the cloud came in brokenly in puff in fold in gray crag and they piled in together and settled low over the west and then the wind stopped and left the cloud deep and solid the rain began with gusty shower pause and downpour and then gradually it settled to a single tempo small drop and a steady beat rain that wa gray to see through rain that cut midday light to evening and at first the dry earth sucked the moisture down and blackened for two day the earth drank the rain until the earth wa full then puddle formed and in the low place little lake formed in the field the muddy lake rose higher and the steady rain whipped the shining water at last the mountain were full and the hill side spilled into the stream built them to freshet and sent them roaring down the canyon into the valley the rain beat on steadily and the stream and the little river edged up to the bank side and worked at willow and tree root bent the willow deep in the current cut out the root of cottonwood and brought down the tree the muddy water whirled along the bank side and crept up the bank until at last it spilled over into the field into the orchard into th cotton patch where the black stem stood level field be came lake broad and gray and the rain whipped up the sun fife the grape of wrath face then the water poured over the highway and car moved slowly cutting the water ahead and leaving a boiling muddy wake behind the earth whispered under the beat of the rain and the stream thundered under the churning freshet when the first rain started the migrant people huddled in their tent saying it ll soon be over and asking how long s it likely to go on and when the puddle formed the men went out in the rain with shovel and built little dike around the tent the beating rain worked at the canvas until it penetrated and sent stream down and then the little dike washed out and the water came inside and the stream wet the bed and the blan kets the people sat in wet clothes they set up box and put plank on the box then day and night they sat on the plank beside the tent the old car stood and water fouled the ignition wire and water fouled the carburetor the little gray tent stood in lake and at last the people had to move then the car wouldn t start because the wire were shorted and if the engine would run deep mud engulfed the wheel and the people waded away carrying their wet blanket in their arm they splashed along carrying the child car rying the very old in their arm and if a barn stood on high ground it wa filled with people shivering and hopeless then some went to the relief office and they came sadly back to their own people they s rule you got to be here a year before you can git relief they say the gov ment is gon na help they don know when t t i t and gradually the greatest terror of all came along they ain t gon na oe no kinda work for three month the grape of wrath in the barn the people sat huddled together and the ter ror came over them and their face were gray with terror the child cried with hunger and there wa no food then the sickness came pneumonia and measles that went to the eye and to the mastoid and the rain fell steadily and the water flowed over the highway for the culvert could not carry the water then from the tent from the crowded barn group o i sodden men went out their clothes slopping rag their shoe muddy pulp they splashed out through the water to the town to the country store to the relief office to beg for food to cringe and beg for food to beg for relief to try to steal to lie and under the begging and under the cringing a hopeless anger began to smolder and in the little town pity for the sodden men changed to anger and anger at the hungry people changed to fear of them then sheriff swore in deputy in drove and order were rushed for rifle for tear gas for ammunition then the hungry men crowded the alley behind the store to beg for bread to beg for rotting vegetable to steal when they could frantic men pounded on the door of the doctor and the doctor were busy and sad men left word at country store for the coroner to send a car the coroner were not too busy the coroner wagon backed up through the mud and took out the dead and the rain pattered relentlessly down and the stream broke their bank and spread out over the country huddled under shed lying in wet hay the hunger and the fear bred anger then boy went out not to beg but to steal and men went out weakly to try to steal the sheriff swore in new deputy and ordered new rifle and the comfortable people in tight house felt pity at first mm the grape of wrath and then distaste and finally hatred for the migrant people in the wet hay of leaking bam baby were born to woman who panted with pneumonia and old people curled up in comer and died that way so that the coroner could not straighten them at night the frantic men walked boldly to hen roost and carried off the squawking chicken if they were shot at they did not run but splashed sullenly away and if they were hit they sank tiredly in the mud the rain stopped on the field the water stood reflecting the gray sky and the land whispered with moving water and the men came out of the barn out of the shed they squatted on their ham and looked out over the flooded land and they were silent and sometimes they talked very quietly no work till spring no work and if no work no money no food fella had a team of horse had to use em to plow an cul tivate an mow wouldri think a turnin em out to starve when they wasn t workin them s horse we re men the woman watched the men watched to see whether the break had come at last the woman stood silently and watched and where a number of men gathered together the fear went from their face and anger took it place and the woman sighed with relief for they knew it wa all right the break had not come and the break would never come a long a fear could turn to wrath tiny point of grass came through the earth and in a few day the hill were pale green with the beginning year chapter thirty i n the boxcar camp the water stood in puddle and the rain splashed in the mud gradually the little stream crept up the bank toward the low flat where the boxcar stood on the second day of the rain a took the tarpaulin down from the middle of the car he carried it out and spread it on the nose of the truck and he came back into the car and sat down on his mattress now without the separation the two family in the car were one the men sat together and their spirit were damp ma kept a little fire going in the stove kept a few twig burning and she conserved her wood the rain poured down on the nearly flat roof of the boxcar on the third day the wainwright grew restless maybe we better go long mr wainwright said and ma tried to keep them where d you go an be sure of a tight roof i dunno but i got a feelin we oughta go along they j argued together and ma watched al ruthie and winfield tried to play for a while and then j they too relapsed into sullen inactivity and the rain diummed down on the roof on the third day the sound of the stream could be heard j above the drumming rain pa and uncle john stood in the j open door and looked out on the rising stream at both end of the camp the water ran near to the highway but at the i cam p it looped away so that the highway embankment sur f mm the grape of wrath rounded the camp at the back and the stream closed it in oi the front and pa said how s it look to you john seems to me if that crick come up she ll flood u uncle john opened his mouth and rubbed his bristling chin yeah he said

grape of wrath said gon na be ail right all right jus grip ya han s now then take your lip inta your teeth tha s good tha s good the pain passed on they let her rest awhile and then helped her up again and the three walked back and forth back and forth between the pain pa stuck his head in through the narrow opening his hat dripped with water what ya shut the door for he asked and then he saw the walking woman ma said her time s come then then we couldn go f we wanted to no then we got to buif that bank you got to pa sloshed through the mud to the stream his marking stick wa four inch down twenty men stood in the rain pa cried we got to build her my girl got her pain the men gathered about him baby yeah we can t go now a tall man said it ain t our baby we kin go sure pa said you can go go on nobody s stoppin you they s only eight shovel he hurried to the lowest part of the bank and drove his shovel into the mud the shovelful lifted with a sucking sound he drove it again and threw the mud into the low place on the stream bank and beside him the other men ranged themselves they heaped the mud up in a long embankment and those who had no shovel cut live willow whip and wove them in a mat and kicked them into the bank over the men came a fury of work a fury of battle when one man dropped his shovel another took it up they had shed their coat and hat their shirt and trouser clung tightly to their body their shoe oo the grape of wrath were shapeless blob of mud a shrill scream came from the oad car the men stopped listened uneasily and then plunged to work again and the little levee of earth extended until it connected with the highway embankment on either end they were tired now and the shovel moved more slowly and the stream rose slowly it edged above the place where the first dirt had been thrown pa laughed in triumph she d come over if we hadn a built up he cried the stream rose slowly up the side of the new wall and tore at the willow mat higher pa cried we got to git her higher the evening came and the work went on and now the men were beyond weariness their face were set and dead they worked jerkily like machine when it wa dark the woman set lantern in the car door and kept pot of coffee handy and the woman ran one by one to the joad car and wedged themselves inside the pain were coming close now twenty minute apart and rose of sharon had lost her restraint she screamed fiercely under the fierce pain and the neighbor woman looked at her and patted her gently and went back to their own car ma had a good fire going now and all her utensil filled with water sat on the stove to heat every little while pa looked in the car door all right he asked yeah i think so ma assured him a it grew dark someone brought out a flashlight to work by uncle john plunged on throwing mud on top of the wall you take it easy pa said you ll kill yaself the grape of wrath i can t he p it i can t stan that yellin it s like it s like when i know pa said but jus take it easy uncle john blubbered i ll run away by god i got to work or i ll run away pa turned from him how s she stan on the last marker the man with the flashlight threw the beam on the stick the rain cut whitely through the light cornin up she ll come up slower now pa said got to flood purty far on the other side she s cornin up though the woman filled the coffee pot and set them out again and a the night went on the men moved slower and slower and they lifted their heavy foot like draft horse more mud on the levee more willow interlaced the rain fell steadily when the flashlight turned on face the eye showed staring and the muscle on the cheek were welted out for a long time the scream continued from the car and at last they were still pa said ma d call me if it wa bore he went on shovel ing the mud sullenly the stream eddied and boiled against the bank then from up the stream there came a ripping crash the beam of the flashlight showed a great cottonwood toppling the men stopped to watch the branch of the tree sank into the water and edged around with the current while the stream dug out the little root slowly the tree wa freed and slowly it edged down the stream the weary men watched their mouth hanging open the tree moved slowly down then a branch caught on a stump snagged and held and very slowly the root swung around and hooked themselves on the grape of wrath the new embankment the water piled up behind the tree moved and tore the bank a little stream slipped through pa threw himself forward and jammed mud in the break the water piled against the tree and then the bank washed quickly down washed around ankle around knee the men broke and ran and the current worked smoothly into the flat under the car under the automobile uncle john saw the water break through in the murk he could see it uncontrollably his weight pulled him down he went to his knee and the tugging water swirled about his chest pa saw him go hey what s the matter he lifted him to his foot you sick come on the car is high uncle john gathered his strength i dunno he said apologetically leg give out jus give out pa helped him along toward the car when the dike swept out a turned and ran his foot moved heavily the water wa about his calf when he reached the truck he flung the tarpaulin off the nose and jumped into the car he stepped on the starter the engine turned over and over and there wa no bark of the motor he choked the engine deeply the battery turned the sodden motor more and more slowly and there wa no cough over and over slower and slower a set the spark high he felt under the seat for the crank and jumped out the water wa higher than the running board he ran to the front end crank case wa under water now frantically he fitted the crank and twisted around and around and his clenched hand on the crank splashed in the slowly flowing water at each turn at last his frenzy gave out the motor wa full of water the battery fouled by now on slightly higher ground two car were started and their light on they floundered in the grape of wrath the mud and dug their wheel down until finally the driver cut off the motor and sat still looking into the headlight beam and the rain whipped white streak through the light a went slowly around the truck reached in and turned off the ignition when pa reached the cat walk he found the lower end floating he stepped it down into the mud under water think ya can make it awright john he asked til be awright jus go on pa cautiously climbed the cat walk and squeezed himself in the narrow opening the two lamp were turned low ma sat on the mattress beside rose of sharon and ma fanned her still face with a piece of cardboard mr wainwright poked dry brush into the stove and a dank smoke edged out around the lid and filled the car with a smell of burning tissue ma looked up at pa when he entered and then quickly down how is she pa asked ma did not look up at him again awright i think sleepin the air wa fetid and close with the smell of the birth uncle john clambered in and held himself upright against the side of the car mr wainwright left her work and came to pa she pulled him by the elbow toward the comer of the car she picked up a lantern and held it over an apple box in the comer on a newspaper lay a blue shriveled little mummy never breathed said mr wainwright softly never wa alive uncle john turned and shuffled tiredly down the car to the dark end the rain whished softly on the roof now so softly that they could hear uncle john s tired sniffling from the dark the grape of wrath pa looked tip at mr wainwright he took the lantern from her hand and put it on the floor ruthie and winfield were asleep on their own mattress their arm over their eye to cut out the light pa walked slowly to rose of sharon s mattress he tried to squat down but his leg were too tired he knelt instead ma fanned her square of cardboard back and forth she looked at pa for a moment and her eye

they s change all over maybe the water maybe we ll have to go when it s time to go we ll go we ll do what we got to do now hush you might wake her mr wainwright broke twig and poked them in the sodden

doorway and the grape of wrath watched the steely dawn come the rain had stopped but the sky wa deep and solid with cloud a the light came it wa reflected on the water the men could see the current of the stream slipping swiftly down bearing black branch of tree box board the water swirled into the flat where the boxcar stood there wa no sign of the embankment left on the flat the current stopped

it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouse and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypo get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people s hat off then i account it high time to get to sea a soon a i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throw himself upon his sword i quietly take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feeling towards the ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharf a indian isle by coral reef commerce surround it with her surf right and left the street take you waterward it extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by wave and cooled by breeze which a few hour previous were out of sight of land look at the crowd of water gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you see posted like silent sentinel all around the town stand thousand upon thousand of mortal men fixed in ocean revery some leaning against the spile some seated upon the pier head some looking over the bulwark of ship from china some high aloft in the rigging a if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsman of week day pent up in lath and plaster tied to counter nailed to bench clinched to desk how then is this are the green field gone what do they here but look here come more crowd pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouse will not suffice no they must get just a nigh the water a they possibly can without falling in and there they stand mile of them league inlanders all they come from lane and alley street and avenue north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me doe the magnetic virtue of the needle of the compass of all those ship attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lake take almost any path you please and ten to one it carry you down in a dale and leaf you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest revery stand that man on his leg set his foot a going and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes a every one know meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desire to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employ there stand his tree each with a hollow trunk a if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleep his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage go a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodland wind a mazy way reaching to overlapping spur of mountain bathed in their hill side blue but though the picture lie thus tranced and though this pine tree shake down it sigh like leaf upon this shepherd s head yet all were vain unless the shepherd s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairie in june when for score on score of mile you wade knee deep among tiger lily what is the one charm wanting water there is not a drop of water there were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand mile to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handful of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage a a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persian hold the sea holy why did the greek give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and wa drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all river and ocean it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eye and begin to be over conscious of my lung i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea a a passenger for to go a a passenger you must need have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passenger get sea sick grow quarrelsome don t sleep of night do not enjoy themselves much a a general thing no i never go a a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea a a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such office to those who like them for my part i abominate all honorable respectable toil trial and tribulation of every kind whatsoever it is quite a much a i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ship barque brig schooner and what not and a for going a cook though i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on ship board yet somehow i never fancied broiling fowl though once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptian upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummy of those creature in their huge bake house the pyramid no when i go to sea i go a a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast head true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touch one s sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tar pot you have been lording it a a country schoolmaster making the tallest boy stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoic to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wear off in time what of it if some old hunk of a sea captain order me to get a broom and sweep down the deck what doe that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scale of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel think anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunk in that particular instance who ain t a slave tell me that well then however the old sea captain may order me about however they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hand should rub each other s shoulder blade and be content again i always go to sea a a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passenger a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passenger themselves must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thief entailed upon u but being paid what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ill and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea a a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore castle deck for a in this world head wind are far more prevalent than wind from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarter deck get his atmosphere at second hand from the sailor on the forecastle he think he breathes it first but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leader in many other thing at the same time that the leader little suspect it but wherefore it wa that after having repeatedly smelt the sea a a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fate who ha the constant surveillance of me and secretly dog me and influence me in some unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that wa drawn up a long time ago it came in a a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performance i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united state whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan though i can not tell why it wa exactly that those stage manager the fate put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent part in high tragedy and short and easy part in genteel comedy and jolly part in farce though i can not tell why this wa exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstance i think i can see a little into the spring and motif which being cunningly presented to me under various disguise induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it wa a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motif wa the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant sea where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless peril of the whale these with all the attending marvel of a thousand patagonian sight and sound helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such thing would not have been inducement but a for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for thing remote i love to sail forbidden sea and land on barbarous coast not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with it would they let me since it is but well to be on friendly term with all the inmate of the place one lodge in by reason of these thing then the whaling voyage wa welcome the great flood gate of the wonder world swung open and in the wild conceit that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless procession of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter the carpet bag i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet bag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it wa a saturday night in december much wa i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday a most young candidate for the pain and penalty of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may a well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind wa made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there wa a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford ha of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket wa her great original the tyre of this carthage the place where the first dead american whale wa stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the red men first sally out in canoe to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestone so go the story to throw at the whale in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i wa to eat and sleep meanwhile it wa a very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnel i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few piece of silver so wherever you go ishmael said i to myself a i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and don t be too particular with halting step i paced the street and passed the sign of the crossed harpoon but it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red window of the sword fish inn there came such fervent ray that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inch thick in a hard asphaltic pavement rather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projection because from hard remorseless service the sol of my boot were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sound of the tinkling glass within but go on ishmael said i at last don t you hear get away from before the door your patched boot are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the street that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inn such dreary street block of blackness not house on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look a if it were meant for the us of the public so entering the first thing i did wa to stumble over an ash box in the porch ha thought i ha a the flying particle almost choked me are these ash from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoon and the sword fish this then must need be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black face turned round in their row to peer and beyond a black angel of doom wa beating a book in a pulpit it wa a negro church and the preacher s text wa about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the dock and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these word underneath the spouter inn peter coffin coffin spouter rather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there a the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked a if it might have been carted here from the ruin of some burnt district and a the swinging sign had a poverty stricken sort of creak to it i thought that here wa the very spot for cheap lodging and the best of pea coffee it wa a queer sort of place a gable ended old house one side palsied a it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul s tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in door with his foot on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon say an old writer of whose work i possess the only copy extant it maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both side and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i a this passage occurred to my mind old black letter thou reasonest well yes these eye are window and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didn t stop up the chink and the cranny though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it s too late to make any improvement now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chip were carted off a million year ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatter with his shivering he might plug up both ear with rag and put a corn cob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon say old dive in his red silken wrapper he had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitter what northern light let them talk of their oriental summer clime of everlasting conservatory give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coal but what think lazarus can he warm his blue hand by holding them up to the grand northern light would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye god go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dive this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dive himself he too life like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sigh and being a president of a temperance society he only drink the tepid tear of orphan but no more of this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let u scrape the ice from our frosted foot and see what sort of a place this spouter may be chapter the spouter inn entering that gable ended spouter inn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with old fashioned wainscot reminding one of the bulwark of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it wa only by diligent study and a series of systematic visit to it and careful inquiry of the neighbor that you could any way arrive at an understanding of it purpose such unaccountable mass of shade and shadow that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hag had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you wa a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular line floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet wa there a sort of indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but ala deceptive idea would dart you through it s the black sea in a midnight gale it s the unnatural combat of the four primal element it s a blasted heath it s a hyperborean winter scene it s the breaking up of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancy yielded to that one portentous something in the picture s midst that once found out and all the rest were plain but stop doe it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the artist s design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinion of many aged person with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape horner in a great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there with it three dismantled mast alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast head the opposite wall of this entry wa hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous club and spear some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saw others were tufted with knot of human hair and one wa sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mower you shuddered a you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lance and harpoon all broken and deformed some were storied weapon with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty year ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whale between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoon so like a corkscrew now wa flung in javan sea and run away with by a whale year afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty foot and at last wa found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched way cut through what in old time must have been a great central chimney with fireplace all round you enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beam above and such old wrinkled plank beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft s cockpit especially of such a howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass case filled with dusty rarity gathered from this wide world s remotest nook projecting from the further angle of the room stand a dark looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right whale s head be that how it may there stand the vast arched bone of the whale s jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelf ranged round with old decanter bottle flask and in those jaw of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustle a little withered old man who for their money dearly sell the sailor delirium and death abominable are the tumbler into which he pours his poison though true cylinder without within the villanous green goggling glass deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridian rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpad goblet fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seaman gathered about a table examining by a dim light diver specimen of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house wa full not a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objection to sharing a harpooneer s blanket have ye i s pose you are goin a whalin so you d better get used to that sort of thing i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer wa not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man s blanket i thought so all right take a seat supper you want supper supper ll be ready directly i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar wa still further adorning it with his jack knife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his leg he wa trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didn t make much headway i thought at last some four or five of u were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it wa cold a iceland no fire at all the landlord said he couldn t afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candle each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jacket and hold to our lip cup of scalding tea with our half frozen finger but the fare wa of the most substantial kind not only meat and potato but dumpling good heaven dumpling for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumpling in a most direful manner my boy said the landlord you ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumpling he don t he eats nothing but steak and he like em rare the devil he doe say i where is that harpooneer is he here he ll be here afore long wa the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening a a looker on presently a rioting noise wa heard without starting up the landlord cried that s the grampus s crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three year voyage and a full ship hurrah boy now we ll have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boot wa heard in the entry the door wa flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariner enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coat and with their head muffled in woollen comforter all bedarned and ragged and their beard stiff with icicle they seemed an eruption of bear from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this wa the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch like potion of gin and molasses which he swore wa a sovereign cure for all cold and catarrh whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island the liquor soon mounted into their head a it generally doe even with the arrantest toper newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmate by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making a much noise a the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea god had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner one so far a this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six foot in height with noble shoulder and a chest like a coffer dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face wa deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadow of his eye floated some reminiscence that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he wa a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineer from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companion had mounted to it height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minute however he wa missed by his shipmate and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington where s bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it wa now about nine o clock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgy i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seaman no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i don t know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it come to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objection indefinitely multiply nor wa there any earthly reason why i a a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailor no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor king do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it wa fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen a the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it wa getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming landlord i ve changed my mind about that harpooneer i shan t sleep with him i ll try the bench here just a you please i m sorry i can t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and it s a plaguy rough board here feeling of the knot and notch but wait a bit skrimshander i ve got a carpenter s plane there in the bar wait i say and i ll make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shaving flew right and left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord wa near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven s sake to quit the bed wa soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shaving with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it wa a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it wa a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room wa about four inch higher than the planed one so there wa no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially a another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwind in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldn t i steal a march on him bolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knocking it seemed no bad idea but upon second thought i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon a i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person s bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudice against this unknown harpooneer think i i ll wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i ll have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellow after all there s no telling but though the other boarder kept coming in by one two and three and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer landlord said i what sort of a chap is he doe he always keep such late hour it wa now hard upon twelve o clock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally he s an early bird airley to bed and airley to rise yes he s the bird what catch the worm but to night he went out a peddling you see and i don t see what on airth keep him so late unless may be he can t sell his head can t sell his head what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town that s precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldn t sell it here the market s overstocked with what shouted i with head to be sure ain t there too many head in the world i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you d better stop spinning that yarn to me i m not green may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head i ll break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord s it s broke a ready said he broke said i broke do you mean sartain and that s the very reason he can t sell it i guess landlord said i going up to him a cool a mt hecla in a snow storm landlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating story tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow a sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respect safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good a to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i ve no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rip a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of ha just arrived from the south sea where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand head great curio you know and he s sold all on em but one and that one he s trying to sell to night cause to morrow s sunday and it would not do to be sellin human head about the street when folk is goin to church he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just a he wa goin out of the door with four head strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inion this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business a selling the head of dead idolators depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man he pay reg lar wa the rejoinder but come it s getting dreadful late you had better be turning fluke it s a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed it s an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it wouldn t do come along here i ll give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it s sunday you won t see that harpooneer to night he s come to anchor somewhere come along then do come won t ye come i considered the matter a moment and then up stair we went and i wa ushered into a small room cold a a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneer to sleep abreast there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty a a wash stand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four wall and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of thing not properly belonging to the room there wa a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman s bag containing the harpooneer s wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there wa a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook on the shelf over the fire place and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edge with little tinkling tag something like the stained porcupine quill round an indian moccasin there wa a hole or slit in the middle of this mat a you see the same in south american poncho but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the street of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp a though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head peddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bed side i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeve but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed a i wa and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer s not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloon and boot and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven whether that mattress wa stuffed with corn cob or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door lord save me think i that must be the harpooneer the infernal head peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cord of the large bag i before spoke of a being in the room i wa all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag s mouth this accomplished however he turned round when good heaven what a sight such a face it wa of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking square yes it s just a i thought he s a terrible bedfellow he s been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be sticking plaster at all those black square on his cheek they were stain of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too who falling among the cannibal had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyage must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it s only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the square of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south sea and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effect upon the skin now while all these idea were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a seal skin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hat a new beaver hat when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there wa no hair on his head none to speak of at least nothing but a small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even a it wa i thought something of slipping out of the window but it wa the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this head peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i wa now a much afraid of him a if it wa the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i wa so afraid of him that i wa not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arm a i live these covered part of him were checkered with the same square a his face his back too wa all over the same dark square he seemed to have been in a thirty year war and just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt still more his very leg were marked a if a parcel of dark green frog were running up the trunk of young palm it wa now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south sea and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of head too perhaps the head of his own brother he might take a fancy to mine heaven look at that tomahawk but there wa no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pocket and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on it back and exactly the colour of a three day old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin wa a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it wa not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage go up to the empty fire place and removing the papered fire board set up this little hunch backed image like a tenpin between the andiron the chimney jamb and all the brick inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eye hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what wa next to follow first he take about a double handful of shaving out of his grego pocket and place them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shaving into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatch into the fire and still hastier withdrawal of his finger whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ash a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lip all these strange antic were accompanied by still stranger guttural noise from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket a carelessly a if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceeding increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptom of concluding his business operation and jumping into bed with me i thought it wa high time now or never before the light wa put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say wa a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great cloud of tobacco smoke the next moment the light wa extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural response satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning who e debel you he at last said you no speak e dam me i kill e and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark landlord for god s sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch coffin angel save me speak e tell ee me who ee be or dam me i kill e again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ash about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him don t be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldn t harm a hair of your head stop your grinning shouted i and why didn t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer wa a cannibal i thought ye know d it didn t i tell ye he wa a peddlin head around town but turn fluke again and go to sleep queequeg look here you sabbee me i sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee me sabbee plenty grunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he wa on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what s all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myself the man s a human being just a i am he ha just a much reason to fear me a i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i don t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it s dangerous besides i ain t insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bed rolling over to one side a much a to say i won t touch a leg of ye good night landlord said i you may go i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequeg s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane wa of patchwork full of odd little parti coloured square and triangle and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two part of which were of one precise shade owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeve irregularly rolled up at various time this same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it a the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hue together and it wa only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg wa hugging me my sensation were strange let me try to explain them when i wa a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it wa a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance wa this i had been cutting up some caper or other i think it wa trying to crawl up the chimney a i had seen a little sweep do a few day previous and my stepmother who somehow or other wa all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless my mother dragged me by the leg out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it wa only two o clock in the afternoon of the st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there wa no help for it so up stair i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself a slowly a possible so a to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheet i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hour must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hour in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it wa so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coach in the street and the sound of gay voice all over the house i felt worse and worse at last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged foot sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her foot beseeching her a a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she wa the best and most conscientious of stepmother and back i had to go to my room for several hour i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortune at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from it half steeped in dream i opened my eye and the before sun lit room wa now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing wa to be seen and nothing wa to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bed side for what seemed age piled on age i lay there frozen with the most awful fear not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for day and week and month afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempt to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensation at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg s pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past night s event soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom clasp yet sleeping a he wa he still hugged me tightly a though naught but death should part u twain i now strove to rouse him queequeg but his only answer wa a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling a if it were in a horse collar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage s side a if it were a hatchet faced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequeg in the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulation upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff a a pike staff looking at me and rubbing his eye a if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgiving now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became a it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain sign and sound gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself think i queequeg under the circumstance this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savage have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i wa guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motion for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you don t see every day he and his way were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and then still minus his trowsers he hunted up his boot what under the heaven he did it for i can not tell but his next movement wa to crush himself boot in hand and hat on under the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and straining i inferred he wa hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boot but queequeg do you see wa a creature in the transition stage neither caterpillar nor butterfly he wa just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner his education wa not yet completed he wa an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boot at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eye and began creaking and limping about the room a if not being much accustomed to boot his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide one probably not made to order either rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtain to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boot on i begged him a well a i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloon a soon a possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablution to his chest arm and hand he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i wa watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he take the harpoon from the bed corner slip out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begin a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheek think i queequeg this is using rogers s best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edge are always kept the rest of his toilet wa soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshal s baton chapter breakfast i quickly followed suit and descending into the bar room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the more s the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way and the man that ha anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the bar room wa now full of the boarder who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not a yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mate and second mate and third mate and sea carpenter and sea cooper and sea blacksmith and harpooneer and ship keeper a brown and brawny company with bosky beard an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jacket for morning gown you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellow s healthy cheek is like a sun toasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost a musky he can not have been three day landed from his indian voyage that man next him look a few shade lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless ha tarried whole week ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tint seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climate zone by zone grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite self possessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dog a ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which wa the sum of poor mungo s performance this kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere these reflection just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i wa preparing to hear some good story about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of sea dog many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whale on the high sea entire stranger to them and duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling all of kindred taste looking round a sheepishly at each other a though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountain a curious sight these bashful bear these timid warrior whalemen but a for queequeg why queequeg sat there among them at the head of the table too it so chanced a cool a an icicle to be sure i can not say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many head and grappling the beefsteak towards him but that wa certainly very coolly done by him and every one know that in most people s estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequeg s peculiarity here how he eschewed coffee and hot roll and applied his undivided attention to beefsteak done rare enough that when breakfast wa over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk pipe and wa sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll chapter the street if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual a queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the street of new bedford in thoroughfare nigh the dock any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescript from foreign part even in broadway and chestnut street mediterranean mariner will sometimes jostle the affrighted lady regent street is not unknown to lascar and malay and at bombay in the apollo green live yankee have often scared the native but new bedford beat all water street and wapping in these last mentioned haunt you see only sailor but in new bedford actual cannibal stand chatting at street corner savage outright many of whom yet carry on their bone unholy flesh it make a stranger stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimen of the whaling craft which unheeded reel about the street you will see other sight still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town score of green vermonter and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frame fellow who have felled forest and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale lance many are a green a the green mountain whence they came in some thing you would think them but a few hour old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wear a beaver hat and swallow tailed coat girdled with a sailor belt and sheath knife here come another with a sou wester and a bombazine cloak no town bred dandy will compare with a country bred one i mean a downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that in the dog day will mow his two acre in buckskin glove for fear of tanning his hand now when a country dandy like this take it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and join the great whale fishery you should see the comical thing he doe upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his sea outfit he order bell button to his waistcoat strap to his canvas trowsers ah poor hay seed how bitterly will burst those strap in the first howling gale when thou art driven strap button and all down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town ha only harpooneer cannibal and bumpkin to show her visitor not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for u whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in a howling condition a the coast of labrador a it is part of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine the street do not run with milk nor in the spring time do they pave them with fresh egg yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patrician like house park and garden more opulent than in new bedford whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoon round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave house and flowery garden came from the atlantic pacific and indian ocean one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford father they say give whale for dower to their daughter and portion off their niece with a few porpoise a piece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoir of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their length in spermaceti candle in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maple long avenue of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horse chestnut candelabra wise proffer the passer by their tapering upright cone of congregated blossom so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford ha superinduced bright terrace of flower upon the barren refuse rock thrown aside at creation s final day and the woman of new bedford they bloom like their own red rose but rose only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheek is perennial a sunlight in the seventh heaven elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye can not save in salem where they tell me the young girl breathe such musk their sailor sweetheart smell them mile off shore a though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sand chapter the chapel in this same new bedford there stand a whaleman s chapel and few are the moody fisherman shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailor and sailor wife and widow a muffled silence reigned only broken at time by the shriek of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other a if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent island of men and woman sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablet with black border masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following but i do not pretend to quote sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen wa lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november st this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boat crew of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the off shore ground in the pacific december st this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmate sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bow of his boat wa killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august d this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow shaking off the sleet from my ice glazed hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways wa surprised to see queequeg near me affected by the solemnity of the scene there wa a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage wa the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he wa the only one who could not read and therefore wa not reading those frigid inscription on the wall whether any of the relative of the seaman whose name appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not but so many are the unrecorded accident in the fishery and so plainly did several woman present wear the countenance if not the trapping of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing heart the sight of those bleak tablet sympathetically caused the old wound to bleed afresh oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flower can say here here lie my beloved ye know not the desolation that brood in bosom like these what bitter blank in those black bordered marble which cover no ash what despair in those immovable inscription what deadly void and unbidden infidelity in the line that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrection to the being who have placelessly perished without a grave a well might those tablet stand in the cave of elephanta a here in what census of living creature the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb say of them that they tell no tale though containing more secret than the goodwin sand how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indie of this living earth why the life insurance company pay death forfeiture upon immortal in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lie antique adam who died sixty round century ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city all these thing are not without their meaning but faith like a jackal feed among the tomb and even from these dead doubt she gather her most vital hope it need scarcely to be told with what feeling on the eve of a nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablet and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducement to embark fine chance for promotion it seems aye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whaling a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance methinks that in looking at thing spiritual we are too much like oyster observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lee of my better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheer for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself can not chapter the pulpit i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately a the storm pelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man wa the chaplain yes it wa the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he wa a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many year past had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father mapple wa in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissure of his wrinkle there shone certain mild gleam of a newly developing bloom the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february s snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarity about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoe were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpit it wa a very lofty one and since a regular stair to such a height would by it long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stair substituting a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man rope for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it wa seemed by no mean in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hand grasping the ornamental knob of the man rope father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor like but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the step a if ascending the main top of his vessel the perpendicular part of this side ladder a is usually the case with swinging one were of cloth covered rope only the round were of wood so that at every step there wa a joint at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joint in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i wa not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole wa deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere trick of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly tie and connexion yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a self containing stronghold a lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the wall but the side ladder wa not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplain s former sea farings between the marble cenotaph on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed it back wa adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rock and snowy breaker but high above the flying scud and dark rolling cloud there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel s face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship s tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory s plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the cloud are rolling off serenest azure is at hand nor wa the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture it panelled front wa in the likeness of a ship s bluff bow and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ship s fiddle headed beak what could be more full of meaning for the pulpit is ever this earth s foremost part all the rest come in it rear the pulpit lead the world from thence it is the storm of god s quick wrath is first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the god of breeze fair or foul is first invoked for favourable wind yes the world s a ship on it passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is it prow chapter the sermon father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away to larboard larboard gangway to starboard midships midships there wa a low rumbling of heavy sea boot among the bench and a still slighter shuffling of woman s shoe and all wa quiet again and every eye on the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpit s bow folded his large brown hand across his chest uplifted his closed eye and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in prolonged solemn tone like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog in such tone he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanza burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy the rib and terror in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all god s sun lit wave rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pain and sorrow there which none but they that feel can tell oh i wa plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaint no more the whale did me confine with speed he flew to my relief a on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright a lightning shone the face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaf of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmate clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah shipmate this book containing only four chapter four yarn is one of the smallest strand in the mighty cable of the scripture yet what depth of the soul doe jonah s deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to u is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish s belly how billow like and boisterously grand we feel the flood surging over u we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the water sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about u but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teach shipmate it is a two stranded lesson a lesson to u all a sinful men and a lesson to me a a pilot of the living god a sinful men it is a lesson to u all because it is a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awakened fear the swift punishment repentance prayer and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah a with all sinner among men the sin of this son of amittai wa in his wilful disobedience of the command of god never mind now what that command wa or how conveyed which he found a hard command but all the thing that god would have u do are hard for u to do remember that and hence he oftener command u than endeavor to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god by seeking to flee from him he think that a ship made by men will carry him into country where god doe not reign but only the captain of this earth he skulks about the wharf of joppa and seek a ship that s bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all account tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz that s the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmate cadiz is in spain a far by water from joppa a jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient day when the atlantic wa an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa shipmate is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand mile to the westward from that just outside the strait of gibraltar see ye not then shipmate that jonah sought to flee world wide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the sea so disordered self condemning is his look that had there been policeman in those day jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly he s a fugitive no baggage not a hat box valise or carpet bag no friend accompany him to the wharf with their adieu at last after much dodging search he find the tarshish ship receiving the last item of her cargo and a he step on board to see it captain in the cabin all the sailor for the moment desist from hoisting in the good to mark the stranger s evil eye jonah see this but in vain he try to look all ease and confidence in vain essay his wretched smile strong intuition of the man assure the mariner he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whisper to the other jack he s robbed a widow or joe do you mark him he s a bigamist or harry lad i guess he s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderer from sodom another run to read the bill that s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coin for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he read and look from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmate now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hand upon him frighted jonah tremble and summoning all his boldness to his face only look so much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he make the best of it and when the sailor find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pas and he descends into the cabin who s there cry the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his paper for the custom who s there oh how that harmless question mangle jonah for the instant he almost turn to flee again but he rally i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stand before him but no sooner doe he hear that hollow voice than he dart a scrutinizing glance we sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him no sooner sir soon enough for any honest man that go a passenger ha jonah that s another stab but he swiftly call away the captain from that scent i ll sail with ye he say the passage money how much is that i ll pay now for it is particularly written shipmate a if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning now jonah s captain shipmate wa one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity expose it only in the penniless in this world shipmate sin that pay it way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontier so jonah s captain prepares to test the length of jonah s purse ere he judge him openly he charge him thrice the usual sum and it s assented to then the captain know that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolve to help a flight that pave it rear with gold yet when jonah fairly take out his purse prudent suspicion still molest the captain he ring every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutter and jonah is put down for his passage point out my state room sir say jonah now i m travel weary i need sleep thou lookest like it say the captain there s thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laugh lowly to himself and mutter something about the door of convict cell being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty a he is jonah throw himself into his berth and find the little state room ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasp then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ship s water line jonah feel the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowel ward screwed at it axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonah s room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bale received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying level among which it hung the lamp alarm and frightens jonah a lying in his berth his tormented eye roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive find no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hang in me he groan straight upwards so it burn but the chamber of my soul are all in crookedness like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him a the plungings of the roman race horse but so much the more strike his steel tag into him a one who in that miserable plight still turn and turn in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feel a deep stupor steal over him a over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and there s naught to staunch it so after sore wrestling in his berth jonah s prodigy of ponderous misery drag him drowning down to sleep and now the time of tide ha come the ship cast off her cable and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glide to sea that ship my friend wa the first of recorded smuggler the contraband wa jonah but the sea rebel he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm come on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain call all hand to lighten her when box bale and jar are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunder with trampling foot right over jonah s head in all this raging tumult jonah sleep his hideous sleep he see no black sky and raging sea feel not the reeling timber and little hears he or heed he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the sea after him aye shipmate jonah wa gone down into the side of the ship a berth in the cabin a i have taken it and wa fast asleep but the frightened master come to him and shriek in his dead ear what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that direful cry jonah stagger to his foot and stumbling to the deck grasp a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwark wave after wave thus leap into the ship and finding no speedy vent run roaring fore and aft till the mariner come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever a the white moon show her affrighted face from the steep gully in the blackness overhead aghast jonah see the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep terror upon terror run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitude the god fugitive is now too plainly known the sailor mark him more and more certain grow their suspicion of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lot to see for whose cause this great tempest wa upon them the lot is jonah s that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their question what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmate the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariner but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those question but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him i am a hebrew he cry and then i fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now go on to make a full confession whereupon the mariner became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his desert when wretched jonah cry out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest wa upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other mean to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howl louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah and now behold jonah taken up a an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness float out from the east and the sea is still a jonah carry down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he go down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heed the moment when he drop seething into the yawning jaw awaiting him and the whale shoot to all his ivory teeth like so many white bolt upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fish s belly but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful a he is jonah doe not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feel that his dreadful punishment is just he leaf all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pain and pang he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmate is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god wa this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmate i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you a a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah while he wa speaking these word the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonah s sea storm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved a with a ground swell his tossed arm seemed the warring element at work and the thunder that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearer look on him with a quick fear that wa strange to them there now came a lull in his look a he silently turned over the leaf of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eye for the moment seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these word shipmate god ha laid but one hand upon you both his hand press upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teach to all sinner and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this mast head and sit on the hatch there where you sit and listen a you listen while some one of you read me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teach to me a a pilot of the living god how being an anointed pilot prophet or speaker of true thing and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truth in the ear of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached a we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulf of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the sea where the eddying depth sucked him ten thousand fathom down and the weed were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet out of the belly of hell when the whale grounded upon the ocean s utmost bone even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delight of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beaten his ear like two sea shell still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean jonah did the almighty s bidding and what wa that shipmate to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that wa it this shipmate this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slight it woe to him whom this world charm from gospel duty woe to him who seek to pour oil upon the water when god ha brewed them into a gale woe to him who seek to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world court not dishonor woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him who a the great pilot paul ha it while preaching to others is himself a castaway he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eye a he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm but oh shipmate on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the main truck higher than the kelson is low delight is to him a far far upward and inward delight who against the proud god and commodore of this earth ever stand forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong arm yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world ha gone down beneath him delight is to him who give no quarter in the truth and kill burn and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robe of senator and judge delight top gallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the wave of the billow of the sea of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the age and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breath o father chiefly known to me by thy rod mortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this world s or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hand and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he wa left alone in the place chapter a bosom friend returning to the spouter inn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time he wa sitting on a bench before the fire with his foot on the stove hearth and in one hand wa holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into it face and with a jack knife gently whittling away at it nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the page with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth page a i fancied stopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a long drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time a though he could not count more than fifty and it wa only by such a large number of fifty being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of page wa excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he wa and hideously marred about the face at least to my taste his countenance yet had a something in it which wa by no mean disagreeable you can not hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the trace of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eye fiery black and bold there seemed token of a spirit that would dare a thousand devil and besides all this there wa a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it wa too that his head being shaved his forehead wa drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it wa his head wa phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washington s head a seen in the popular bust of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brow which were likewise very projecting like two long promontory thickly wooded on top queequeg wa george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i wa thus closely scanning him half pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much a a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the page of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savage are strange being at time you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm self collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seaman in the inn he made no advance whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintance all this struck me a mighty singular yet upon second thought there wa something almost sublime in it here wa a man some twenty thousand mile from home by the way of cape horn that is which wa the only way he could get there thrown among people a strange to him a though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely this wa a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there wa such a thing a that but perhaps to be true philosopher we mortal should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon a i hear that such or such a man give himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester a i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after it first intensity ha warmed the air it then only glow to be looked at the evening shade and phantom gathering round the casement and peering in upon u silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swell i began to be sensible of strange feeling i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisy and bland deceit wild he wa a very sight of sight to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same thing that would have repelled most others they were the very magnet that thus drew me i ll try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness ha proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly sign and hint doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advance but presently upon my referring to his last night s hospitality he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellow i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few picture that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sight to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puff from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between u if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan s breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left u crony he seemed to take to me quite a naturally and unbiddenly a i to him and when our smoke wa over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his country s phrase that we were bosom friend he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rule would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollar in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portion pushed one of them towards me and said it wa mine i wa going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pocket i let them stay he then went about his evening prayer took out his idol and removed the paper fireboard by certain sign and symptom i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what wa to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise i wa a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth pagan and all included can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship to do the will of god that is worship and what is the will of god to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me that is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shaving helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own conscience and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosure between friend man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their soul to each other and some old couple often lie and chat over old time till nearly morning thus then in our heart honeymoon lay i and queequeg a cosy loving pair chapter nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short interval and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed leg over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulation what little nappishness remained in u altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though day break wa yet some way down the future yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around u leaning against the head board with our four knee drawn up close together and our two nose bending over them a if our kneepan were warming pan we felt very nice and snug the more so since it wa so chilly out of door indeed out of bed clothes too seeing that there wa no fire in the room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you can not be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomfort of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eye for when between sheet whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eye shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eye be closed a if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essence though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eye then and coming out of my own pleasant and self created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve o clock at night i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puff from his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudice grow when love once come to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord s policy of insurance i wa only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jacket drawn about our shoulder we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over u a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the new lit lamp whether it wa that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scene i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his word yet subsequent disclosure when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such a it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter biographical queequeg wa a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is not down in any map true place never are when a new hatched savage running wild about his native woodland in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goat a if he were a green sapling even then in queequeg s ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father wa a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunt who were the wife of unconquerable warrior there wa excellent blood in his vein royal stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his father s bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian land but the ship having her full complement of seaman spurned his suit and not all the king his father s influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pas through when she quitted the island on one side wa a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thicket that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thicket with it prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship wa gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chain and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ring bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in piece in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlas over his naked wrist queequeg wa the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this fine young savage this sea prince of wale never saw the captain s cabin they put him down among the sailor and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyard of foreign city queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countryman for at bottom so he told me he wa actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christian the art whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but ala the practice of whalemen soon convinced him that even christian could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his father s heathen arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailor did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wage in that place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he it s a wicked world in all meridian i ll die a pagan and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christian wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer way about him though now some time from home by hint i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last account he answered no not yet and added that he wa fearful christianity or rather christian had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan king before him but by and by he said he would return a soon a he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oat in all four ocean they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron wa in lieu of a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movement he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling wa my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket a being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hand in his boldly dip into the potluck of both world to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg he wa an experienced harpooneer and a such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me wa wholly ignorant of the mystery of whaling though well acquainted with the sea a known to merchant seaman his story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter wheelbarrow next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrade s bill using however my comrade s money the grinning landlord a well a the boarder seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg especially a peter coffin s cock and bull story about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our thing including my own poor carpet bag and queequeg s canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf a we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so much for they were used to seeing cannibal like him in their street but at seeing him and me upon such confidential term but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turn and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barb i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ship did not find their own harpoon to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted wa true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it wa of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the heart of whale in short like many inland reaper and mower who go into the farmer meadow armed with their own scythe though in no wise obliged to furnish them even so queequeg for his own private reason preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it wa in sag harbor the owner of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thing though in truth he wa entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow queequeg put his chest upon it lash it fast and then shoulder the barrow and march up the wharf why said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didn t the people laugh upon this he told me another story the people of his island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feast express the fragrant water of young cocoanut into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always form the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and it commander from all account a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captain this commander wa invited to the wedding feast of queequeg s sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guest were assembled at the bride s bamboo cottage this captain march in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king queequeg s father grace being said for those people have their grace a well a we though queequeg told me that unlike u who at such time look downwards to our platter they on the contrary copying the duck glance upwards to the great giver of all feast grace i say being said the high priest open the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating finger into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himself being captain of a ship a having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the king s own house the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hand in the punchbowl taking it i suppose for a huge finger glass now said queequeg what you tink now didn t our people laugh at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terrace of street their ice covered tree all glittering in the clear cold air huge hill and mountain of cask on cask were piled upon her wharf and side by side the world wandering whale ship lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenter and cooper with blended noise of fire and forge to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruise were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begin a second and a second ended only begin a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bow a a young colt his snorting how i snuffed that tartar air how i spurned that turnpike earth that common highway all over dented with the mark of slavish heel and hoof and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no record at the same foam fountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostril swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bow a a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall mast buckling like indian cane in land tornado so full of this reeling scene were we a we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glance of the passenger a lubber like assembly who marvelled that two fellow being should be so companionable a though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some booby and bumpkin there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young sapling mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkin s hour of doom wa come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arm and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in mid somerset the fellow landed with bursting lung upon his foot while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting capting here s the devil hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that don t you know you might have killed that chap what him say said queequeg a he mildly turned to me he say said i that you came near kill e that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn kill e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy small e fish e queequeg no kill e so small e fish e queequeg kill e big whale look you roared the captain i ll kill e you you cannibal if you try any more of your trick aboard here so mind your eye but it so happened just then that it wa high time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main sail had parted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom wa now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly wa swept overboard all hand were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinter nothing wa done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bow and stood eyeing the boom a if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knee and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwark and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom a it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar wa that way trapped and all wa safe the schooner wa run into the wind and while the hand were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minute or more he wa seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arm straight out before him and by turn revealing his brawny shoulder through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now took an instant s glance around him and seeming to see just how matter were dived down and disappeared a few minute more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin wa restored all hand voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive wa there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous society he only asked for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwark and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himself it s a mutual joint stock world in all meridian we cannibal must help these christian chapter nantucket nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stand there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at it a mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than you would use in twenty year a a substitute for blotting paper some gamesome wight will tell you that they have to plant weed there they don t grow naturally that they import canada thistle that they have to send beyond sea for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that piece of wood in nantucket are carried about like bit of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstool before their house to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass make an oasis three blade in a day s walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoe something like laplander snow shoe that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chair and table small clam will sometimes be found adhering a to the back of sea turtle but these extravaganza only show that nantucket is no illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island wa settled by the red men thus go the legend in olden time an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talon with loud lament the parent saw their child borne out of sight over the wide water they resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoe after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket the poor little indian s skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crab and quohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with net for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boat and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ship on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigation round it peeped in at behring s strait and in all season and all ocean declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that ha survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt sea mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panic are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assault and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermit issuing from their ant hill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexander parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian ocean a the three pirate power did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two third of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer s for the sea is his he owns it a emperor own empire other seaman having but a right of way through it merchant ship are but extension bridge armed one but floating fort even pirate and privateer though following the sea a highwayman the road they but plunder other ship other fragment of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riot on the sea he alone in bible language go down to it in ship to and fro ploughing it a his own special plantation there is his home there lie his business which a noah s flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the million in china he life on the sea a prairie cock in the prairie he hide among the wave he climb them a chamois hunter climb the alp for year he know not the land so that when he come to it at last it smell like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset fold her wing and is rocked to sleep between billow so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sail and lay him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herd of walrus and whale chapter chowder it wa quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouter inn had recommended u to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pot whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotel in all nantucket and moreover he had assured u that cousin hosea a he called him wa famous for his chowder in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot luck at the try pot but the direction he had given u about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three point to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place wa these crooked direction of his very much puzzled u at first especially a at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse our first point of departure must be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it wa on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there wa no mistaking two enormous wooden pot painted black and suspended by ass ear swung from the cross tree of an old top mast planted in front of an old doorway the horn of the cross tree were sawed off on the other side so that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i wa over sensitive to such impression at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick wa in my neck a i gazed up to the two remaining horn yes two of them one for queequeg and one for me it s ominous think i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstone staring at me in the whalemen s chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pot too are these last throwing out oblique hint touching tophet i wa called from these reflection by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt get along with ye said she to the man or i ll be combing ye come on queequeg said i all right there s mr hussey and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mr hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affair upon making known our desire for a supper and a bed mr hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered u into a little room and seating u at a table spread with the relic of a recently concluded repast turned round to u and said clam or cod what s that about cod ma am said i with much politeness clam or cod she repeated a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mr hussey say i but that s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time ain t it mr hussey but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who wa waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam mr hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for u both on one clam however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before u but when that smoking chowder came in the mystery wa delightfully explained oh sweet friend hearken to me it wa made of small juicy clam scarcely bigger than hazel nut mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flake the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetite being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mr hussey s clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moment the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine cod chowder wa placed before u we resumed business and while plying our spoon in the bowl think i to myself i wonder now if this here ha any effect on the head what s that stultifying saying about chowder headed people but look queequeg ain t that a live eel in your bowl where s your harpoon fishiest of all fishy place wa the try pot which well deserved it name for the pot there were always boiling chowder chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fish bone coming through your clothes the area before the house wa paved with clam shell mr hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account book bound in superior old shark skin there wa a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fisherman s boat i saw hosea s brindled cow feeding on fish remnant and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod s decapitated head looking very slip shod i assure ye supper concluded we received a lamp and direction from mr hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but a queequeg wa about to precede me up the stair the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chamber why not said i every true whaleman sleep with his harpoon but why not because it s dangerous say she ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort nt v y ge of his when he wa gone four year and a half with only three barrel of ile wa found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarder to take sich dangerous weepons in their room at night so mr queequeg for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod to morrow for breakfast men both say i and let s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety chapter the ship in bed we concocted our plan for the morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting yojo the name of his black little god and yojo had told him two or three time over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whaling fleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch a yojo purposed befriending u and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world a though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg i have forgotten to mention that in many thing queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojo s judgment and surprising forecast of thing and cherished yojo with considerable esteem a a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all case did not succeed in his benevolent design now this plan of queequeg s or rather yojo s touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied upon queequeg s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry u and our fortune securely but a all my remonstrance produced no effect upon queequeg i wa obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom for it seemed that it wa some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how it wa i never could find out for though i applied myself to it several time i never could master his liturgy and xxxix article leaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shaving i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiry i learnt that there were three ship up for three year voyage the devil dam the tit bit and the pequod devil dam i do not know the origin of tit bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember wa the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indian now extinct a the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devil dam from her hopped over to the tit bit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this wa the very ship for u you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i know square toed lugger mountainous japanese junk butter box galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft a this same rare old pequod she wa a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw footed look about her long seasoned and weather stained in the typhoon and calm of all four ocean her old hull s complexion wa darkened like a french grenadier s who ha alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable bow looked bearded her mast cut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original one were lost overboard in a gale her mast stood stiffly up like the spine of the three old king of cologne her ancient deck were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim worshipped flag stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquity were added new and marvellous feature pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many year her chief mate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owner of the pequod this old peleg during the term of his chief mateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkill hake s carved buckler or bedstead she wa apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendant of polished ivory she wa a thing of trophy a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bone of her enemy all round her unpanelled open bulwark were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pin to fasten her old hempen thews and tendon to those thews ran not through base block of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaf of sea ivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller wa in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he hold back his fiery steed by clutching it jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble thing are touched with that now when i looked about the quarter deck for some one having authority in order to propose myself a a candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main mast it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it wa of a conical shape some ten foot high consisting of the long huge slab of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaw of the right whale planted with their broad end on the deck a circle of these slab laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibre waved to and fro like the top knot on some old pottowottamie sachem s head a triangular opening faced towards the bow of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ship s work suspended wa now enjoying respite from the burden of command he wa seated on an old fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which wa formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam wa constructed there wa nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he wa brown and brawny like most old seaman and heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style only there wa a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minutest wrinkle interlacing round his eye which must have arisen from his continual sailing in many hard gale and always looking to windward for this cause the muscle about the eye to become pursed together such eye wrinkle are very effectual in a scowl is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of the tent supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him he demanded i wa thinking of shipping thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketer ever been in a stove boat no sir i never have dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare say eh nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn i ve been several voyage in the merchant service and i think that merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that leg i ll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ship but fluke man what make thee want to go a whaling eh it look a little suspicious don t it eh hast not been a pirate hast thou didst not rob thy last captain didst thou dost not think of murdering the officer when thou gettest to sea i protested my innocence of these thing i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendo this old seaman a an insulated quakerish nantucketer wa full of his insular prejudice and rather distrustful of all alien unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard but what take thee a whaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab who is captain ahab sir aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship i am mistaken then i thought i wa speaking to the captain himself thou art speaking to captain peleg that s who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her need including crew we are part owner and agent but a i wa going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is a thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he ha only one leg what do you mean sir wa the other one lost by a whale lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it wa devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat ah ah i wa a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said a calmly a i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there wa any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred a much from the simple fact of the accident look ye now young man thy lung are a sort of soft d ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit sure ye ve been to sea before now sure of that sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyage in the merchant hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant service don t aggravate me i won t have it but let u understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it i do sir very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale s throat and then jump after it answer quick i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i don t take to be the fact good again now then thou not only wantest to go a whaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world wa not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crow s foot into one scowl captain peleg started me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide wa now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect wa unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see well what s the report said peleg when i came back what did ye see not much i replied nothing but water considerable horizon though and there s a squall coming up i think well what doe thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh can t ye see the world where you stand i wa a little staggered but go a whaling i must and i would and the pequod wa a good a ship a any i thought the best and all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me and thou mayest a well sign the paper right off he added come along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin seated on the transom wa what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg wa one of the largest owner of the vessel the other share a is sometimes the case in these port being held by a crowd of old annuitant widow fatherless child and chancery ward each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessel the same way that you do yours in approved state stock bringing in good interest now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers wa a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day it inhabitant in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarity of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by thing altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quaker are the most sanguinary of all sailor and whale hunter they are fighting quaker they are quaker with a vengeance so that there are instance among them of men who named with scripture name a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent life strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarity a thousand bold dash of character not unworthy a scandinavian sea king or a poetical pagan roman and when these thing unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who ha also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night watch in the remotest water and beneath constellation never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all nature s sweet or savage impression fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantage to learn a bold and nervous lofty language that man make one in a whole nation s census a mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedy nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstance he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but a yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only result again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstance like captain peleg captain bildad wa a well to do retired whaleman but unlike captain peleg who cared not a rush for what are called serious thing and indeed deemed those self same serious thing the veriest of all trifle captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creature round the horn all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much a altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness wa there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruple to bear arm against land invader yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled tun upon tun of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his day the pious bildad reconciled these thing in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man s religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this world pay dividend rising from a little cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad bellied waistcoat from that becoming boat header chief mate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad a i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining day to the quiet receiving of his well earned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunk and in his sea going day a bitter hard task master they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he wa certainly rather hard hearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad wa a chief mate to have his drab coloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something a hammer or a marling spike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person wa the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat such then wa the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the deck wa small and there bolt upright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tail his broad brim wa placed beside him his leg were stiffly crossed his drab vesture wa buttoned up to his chin and spectacle on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scripture now for the last thirty year to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad a if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg he say he s our man bildad said peleg he want to ship dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me i dost said i unconsciously he wa so intense a quaker what do ye think of him bildad said peleg he ll do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially a peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ship s article placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it wa high time to settle with myself at what term i would be willing to engage for the voyage i wa already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wage but all hand including the captain received certain share of the profit called lay and that these lay were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duty of the ship s company i wa also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i wa used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the th lay that is the th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the th lay wa what they call a rather long lay yet it wa better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three year beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver it might be thought that this wa a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune and so it wa a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortune and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the th considering i wa of a broad shouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profit wa this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietor of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owner left nearly the whole management of the ship s affair to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hand especially a i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible a if at his own fireside now while peleg wa vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack knife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he wa such an interested party in these proceeding bildad never heeded u but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth where moth well captain bildad interrupted peleg what d ye say what lay shall we give this young man thou knowest best wa the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and seventy seventh wouldn t be too much would it where moth and rust do corrupt but lay lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventy seventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many lay here below where moth and rust do corrupt it wa an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy seven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventy seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy seven gold doubloon and so i thought at the time why blast your eye bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that seven hundred and seventy seventh again said bildad without lifting his eye and then went on mumbling for where your treasure is there will your heart be also i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owner of this ship widow and orphan many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labor of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widow and those orphan the seven hundred and seventy seventh lay captain peleg thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matter i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inch of water or ten fathom i can t tell but a thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me it s an all fired outrage to tell any human creature that he s bound to hell fluke and flame bildad say that again to me and start my soul bolt but i ll i ll yes i ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horn on out of the cabin ye canting drab coloured son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye a he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owner of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt wa all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his way a for peleg after letting off his rage a he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little a if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at last the squall s gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack knife here need the grindstone that s he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmael s thy name didn t ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who want to ship too shall i bring him down to morrow to be sure said peleg fetch him along and we ll look at him what lay doe he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg ha he ever whaled it any turning to me killed more whale than i can count captain peleg well bring him along then and after signing the paper off i went nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning s work and that the pequod wa the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i wa to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many case a whale ship will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain make himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyage are so prolonged and the shore interval at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he doe not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaf her to the owner till all is ready for sea however it is always a well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hand turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab wa to be found and what dost thou want of captain ahab it s all right enough thou art shipped yes but i should like to see him but i don t think thou wilt be able to at present i don t know exactly what s the matter with him but he keep close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he don t look so in fact he ain t sick but no he isn t well either any how young man he won t always see me so i don t suppose he will thee he s a queer man captain ahab so some think but a good one oh thou lt like him well enough no fear no fear he s a grand ungodly god like man captain ahab doesn t speak much but when he doe speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahab s above the common ahab s been in college a well a mong the cannibal been used to deeper wonder than the wave fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foe than whale his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he ain t captain bildad no and he ain t captain peleg he s ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest wa a crowned king and a very vile one when that wicked king wa slain the dog did they not lick his blood come hither to me hither hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he wa only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fool like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee it s a lie i know captain ahab well i ve sailed with him a mate year ago i know what he is a good man not a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good man something like me only there s a good deal more of him aye aye i know that he wa never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he wa a little out of his mind for a spell but it wa the sharp shooting pain in his bleeding stump that brought that about a any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale he s been a kind of moody desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pas off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man it s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he ha a wife not three voyage wedded a sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man ha a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab ha his humanity a i walked away i wa full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don t know what unless it wa the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i can not at all describe wa not exactly awe i do not know what it wa but i felt it and it did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly a he wa known to me then however my thought were at length carried in other direction so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind chapter the ramadan a queequeg s ramadan or fasting and humiliation wa to continue all day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night fall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody s religious obligation never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ant worshipping a toad stool or those other creature in certain part of our earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planet bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possession yet owned and rented in his name i say we good presbyterian christian should be charitable in these thing and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortal pagan and what not because of their half crazy conceit on these subject there wa queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notion about yojo and his ramadan but what of that queequeg thought he knew what he wa about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on u all presbyterian and pagan alike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending towards evening when i felt assured that all his performance and ritual must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer i tried to open it but it wa fastened inside queequeg said i softly through the key hole all silent i say queequeg why don t you speak it s i ishmael but all remained still a before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key hole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect wa but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i wa surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg s harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber that s strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stand yonder and he seldom or never go abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake queequeg queequeg all still something must have happened apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stair i quickly stated my suspicion to the first person i met the chamber maid la la she cried i thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door wa locked and not a mouse to be heard and it s been just so silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping la la ma am mistress murder mr hussey apoplexy and with these cry she ran towards the kitchen i following mr hussey soon appeared with a mustard pot in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castor and scolding her little black boy meantime wood house cried i which way to it run for god s sake and fetch something to pry open the door the axe the axe he s had a stroke depend upon it and so saying i wa unmethodically rushing up stair again empty handed when mr hussey interposed the mustard pot and vinegar cruet and the entire castor of her countenance what s the matter with you young man get the axe for god s sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so a to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my door and with that she seized my arm what s the matter with you what s the matter with you shipmate in a calm but rapid a manner a possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegar cruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimed no i haven t seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing of the stair she glanced in and returning told me that queequeg s harpoon wa missing he s killed himself she cried it s unfort nate stiggs done over again there go another counterpane god pity his poor mother it will be the ruin of my house ha the poor lad a sister where s that girl there betty go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign with no suicide permitted here and no smoking in the parlor might a well kill both bird at once kill the lord be merciful to his ghost what s that noise there you young man avast there and running up after me she caught me a i wa again trying to force open the door i don t allow it i won t have my premise spoiled go for the locksmith there s one about a mile from here but avast putting her hand in her side pocket here s a key that ll fit i guess let s see and with that she turned it in the lock but ala queequeg s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within have to burst it open said i and wa running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premise but i tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heaven there sat queequeg altogether cool and self collected right in the middle of the room squatting on his ham and holding yojo on top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life queequeg said i going up to him queequeg what s the matter with you he hain t been a sittin so all day ha he said the landlady but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so a to change his position for it wa almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially a in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hour going too without his regular meal mr hussey said i he s alive at all event so leave u if you please and i will see to this strange affair myself closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could do for all my polite art and blandishment he would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their ham that way in his native island it must be so yes it s part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest he ll get up sooner or later no doubt it can t last for ever thank god and his ramadan only come once a year and i don t believe it s very punctual then i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long story of some sailor who had just come from a plum pudding voyage a they called it that is a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven o clock i went up stair to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he wa just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his ham in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head for heaven s sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper you ll starve you ll kill yourself queequeg but not a word did he reply despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him a it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of queequeg not four foot off sitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his ham in this dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg a if he had been screwed down to the floor but a soon a the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joint but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan wa over now a i before hinted i have no objection to any person s religion be it what it may so long a that person doe not kill or insult any other person because that other person don t believe it also but when a man s religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine make this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religion and coming down to the various religion of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lent ramadan and prolonged ham squatting in cold cheerless room were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious law of hygiene and common sense i told him too that he being in other thing such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his besides argued i fasting make the body cave in hence the spirit cave in and all thought born of a fast must necessarily be half starved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionist cherish such melancholy notion about their hereafter in one word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsia nurtured by ramadan i then asked queequeg whether he himself wa ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it wa after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o clock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inference without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it wa the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trencher and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanut and with some parsley in their mouth were sent round with the victor s compliment to all his friend just a though these present were so many christmas turkey after all i do not think that my remark about religion made much impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my idea simply a i would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion a though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowder of all sort so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bone chapter his mark a we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed u from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend wa a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibal on board that craft unless they previously produced their paper what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwark and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf i mean he replied he must show his paper yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind peleg s out of the wigwam he must show that he s converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in communion with any christian church why said i he s a member of the first congregational church here be it said that many tattooed savage sailing in nantucket ship at last come to be converted into the church first congregational church cried bildad what that worship in deacon deuteronomy coleman s meeting house and so saying taking out his spectacle he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwark took a good long look at queequeg how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man no said peleg and he hasn t been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devil s blue off his face do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomy s meeting i never saw him going there and i pas it every lord s day i don t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with me explain thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of u and every mother s son and soul of u belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of u cherish some queer crotchet no way touching the grand belief in that we all join hand splice thou mean st splice hand cried peleg drawing nearer young man you d better ship for a missionary instead of a fore mast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomy why father mapple himself couldn t beat it and he s reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the paper i say tell quohog there what s that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon he s got there look like good stuff that and he handle it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whale boat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwark from thence into the bow of one of the whale boat hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way a this cap ain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildad s broad brim clean across the ship s deck and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line spos ee him whale e eye why dad whale dead quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ship s paper we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boat look ye quohog we ll give ye the ninetieth lay and that s more than ever wa given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg wa soon enrolled among the same ship s company to which i myself belonged when all preliminary were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there don t know how to write doe he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremony looked no way abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which wa tattooed upon his arm so that through captain peleg s obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this quohog his x mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pocket of his broad skirted drab coat took out a bundle of tract and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in queequeg s hand and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eye and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the soul of all it crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan way which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad s language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrase avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg pious harpooneer never make good voyager it take the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there wa young nat swaine once the bravest boat header out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whale for fear of after clap in case he got stove and went to davy jones peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eye and hand thou thyself a i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then can st thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three mast overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did st thou not think of death and the judgment then hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hand far down into his pocket hear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three mast making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over u fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life wa what captain ahab and i wa thinking of and how to save all hand how to rig jury mast how to get into the nearest port that wa what i wa thinking of bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmaker who were mending a top sail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter the prophet shipmate have ye shipped in that ship queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thought when the above word were put to u by a stranger who pausing before u levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he wa but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent small pox had in all direction flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing water have been dried up have ye shipped in her he repeated you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him aye the pequod that ship there he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object yes said i we have just signed the article anything down there about your soul about what oh perhaps you hav n t got any he said quickly no matter though i know many chap that hav n t got any good luck to em and they are all the better off for it a soul s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon what are you jabbering about shipmate said i he s got enough though to make up for all deficiency of that sort in other chap abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he queequeg said i let s go this fellow ha broken loose from somewhere he s talking about something and somebody we don t know stop cried the stranger ye said true ye hav n t seen old thunder yet have ye who s old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner captain ahab what the captain of our ship the pequod aye among some of u old sailor chap he go by that name ye hav n t seen him yet have ye no we hav n t he s sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before what do you know about him what did they tell you about him say that they didn t tell much of anything about him only i ve heard that he s a good whale hunter and a good captain to his crew that s true that s true yes both true enough but you must jump when he give an order step and growl growl and go that s the word with captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three day and night nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa heard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didn t ye hear a word about them matter and something more eh no i don t think ye did how could ye who know it not all nantucket i guess but hows ever mayhap ye ve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes that every one know a most i mean they know he s only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i don t know and i don t much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg all about it eh sure you do all pretty sure with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar like stranger stood a moment a if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and said ye ve shipped have ye name down on the paper well well what s signed is signed and what s to be will be and then again perhaps it won t be after all anyhow it s all fixed and arranged a ready and some sailor or other must go with him i suppose a well these a any other men god pity em morning to ye shipmate morning the ineffable heaven bless ye i m sorry i stopped ye look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell u out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle u you are mistaken in your game that s all i have to say and it s said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him the like of ye morning to ye shipmate morning oh when ye get there tell em i ve concluded not to make one of em ah my dear fellow you can t fool u that way you can t fool u it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look a if he had a great secret in him morning to ye shipmate morning morning it is said i come along queequeg let s leave this crazy man but stop tell me your name will you elijah elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each other s fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he wa nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yard when chancing to turn a corner and looking back a i did so who should be seen but elijah following u though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he wa dogging u but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half hinting half revealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kind of vague wonderment and half apprehension and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy thing i wa resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah wa really dogging u or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our step but elijah passed on without seeming to notice u this relieved me and once more and finally a it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter all astir a day or two passed and there wa great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sail being mended but new sail were coming on board and bolt of canvas and coil of rigging in short everything betokened that the ship s preparation were hurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look out upon the hand bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the store and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night fall on the day following queequeg s signing the article word wa given at all the inn where the ship s company were stopping that their chest must be on board before night for there wa no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our trap resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they always give very long notice in these case and the ship did not sail for several day but no wonder there wa a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many thing to be thought of before the pequod wa fully equipped every one know what a multitude of thing bed sauce pan knife and fork shovel and tongs napkin nut cracker and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a three year housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocer costermonger doctor baker and banker and though this also hold true of merchant vessel yet not by any mean to the same extent a with whalemen for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous article peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbor usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ship whaling vessel are the most exposed to accident of all kind and especially to the destruction and loss of the very thing upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boat spare spar and spare line and harpoon and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoop and stave but a before hinted for some time there wa a continual fetching and carrying on board of diver odds and end of thing both large and small chief among those who did this fetching and carrying wa captain bildad s sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickle for the steward s pantry another time with a bunch of quill for the chief mate s desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one s rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which wa charity aunt charity a everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad wa concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of well saved dollar but it wa startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board a she did the last day with a long oil ladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor wa bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward a for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the article needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchway roaring up to the rigger at the mast head and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam during these day of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and a often i asked about captain ahab and how he wa and when he wa going to come on board his ship to these question they would answer that he wa getting better and better and wa expected aboard every day meantime the two captain peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eye on the man who wa to be the absolute dictator of it so soon a the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when a man suspect any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicion even from himself and much this way it wa with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing at last it wa given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start chapter going aboard it wa nearly six o clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf there are some sailor running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg it can t be shadow she s off by sunrise i guess come on avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind u laid a hand upon both our shoulder and then insinuating himself between u stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it wa elijah going aboard hand off will you said i lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way ain t going aboard then yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent no no no i wasn t aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glance elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we are going to the indian and pacific ocean and would prefer not to be detained ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast he s cracked queequeg said i come on holloa cried stationary elijah hailing u when we had removed a few pace never mind him said i queequeg come on but he stole up to u again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder said did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago struck by this plain matter of fact question i answered saying yes i thought i did see four or five men but it wa too dim to be sure very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after u and touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye find who morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i wa going to warn ye against but never mind never mind it s all one all in the family too sharp frost this morning ain t it good bye to ye shan t see ye again very soon i guess unless it s before the grand jury and with these cracked word he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance wa locked within the hatch were all on and lumbered with coil of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered pea jacket he wa thrown at whole length upon two chest his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arm the profoundest slumber slept upon him those sailor we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijah s otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleeper s rear a though feeling if it wa soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there gracious queequeg don t sit there said i oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way won t hurt him face face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes he s heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy it s grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look he ll twitch you off soon i wonder he don t wake queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the foot we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settee and sofa of all sort the king chief and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower order for ottoman and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellow and lay them round in the pier and alcove besides it wa very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden chair which are convertible into walking stick upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place while narrating these thing every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he flourished the hatchet side of it over the sleeper s head what s that for queequeg perry easy kill e oh perry easy he wa going on with some wild reminiscence about his tomahawk pipe which it seemed had in it two us both brained his foe and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eye holloa he breathed at last who be ye smoker shipped men answered i when doe she sail aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sail to day the captain came aboard last night what captain ahab who but him indeed i wa going to ask him some further question concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck holloa starbuck s astir said the rigger he s a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we followed it wa now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in two and three the rigger bestirred themselves the mate were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last thing on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin chapter merry christmas at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship s rigger and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the ever thoughtful charity had come off in a whale boat with her last gift a night cap for stubb the second mate her brother in law and a spare bible for the steward after all this the two captain peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is all ready just spoke to him nothing more to be got from shore eh well call all hand then muster em aft here blast em no need of profane word however great the hurry peleg said bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter deck just a if they were to be joint commander at sea a well a to all appearance in port and a for captain ahab no sign of him wa yet to be seen only they said he wa in the cabin but then the idea wa that his presence wa by no mean necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed a that wa not at all his proper business but the pilot s and a he wa not yet completely recovered so they said therefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially a in the merchant service many captain never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merry making with their shore friend before they quit the ship for good with the pilot but there wa not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg wa now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad aft here ye son of bachelor he cried a the sailor lingered at the main mast mr starbuck drive em aft strike the tent there wa the next order a i hinted before this whalebone marquee wa never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty year the order to strike the tent wa well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor man the capstan blood and thunder jump wa the next command and the crew sprang for the handspike now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officer wa one of the licensed pilot of the port he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ship he wa concerned in for he never piloted any other craft bildad i say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bow for the approaching anchor and at interval singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hand at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girl in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three day previous bildad had told them that no profane song would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watt in each seaman s berth meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the peril we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i wa comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventy seventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round wa horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that wa my first kick is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared spring thou sheep head spring and break thy backbone why don t ye spring i say all of ye spring quohog spring thou chap with the red whisker spring there scotch cap spring thou green pant spring i say all of ye and spring your eye out and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody think i captain peleg must have been drinking something to day at last the anchor wa up the sail were set and off we glided it wa a short cold christmas and a the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased u in ice a in polished armor the long row of teeth on the bulwark glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusk of some huge elephant vast curving icicle depended from the bow lank bildad a pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon a the old craft deep dived into the green sea and sent the shivering frost all over her and the wind howled and the cordage rang his steady note were heard sweet field beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to the jew old canaan stood while jordan rolled between never did those sweet word sound more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet foot and wetter jacket there wa yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and mead and glade so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing that the two pilot were needed no longer the stout sail boat that had accompanied u began ranging alongside it wa curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage beyond both stormy cape a ship in which some thousand of his hard earned dollar were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed a captain a man almost a old a he once more starting to encounter all the terror of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him poor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious stride ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless water only bounded by the far off unseen eastern continent looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon it pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face a much a to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can a for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there wa a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to deck now a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about him captain bildad come old shipmate we must go back the main yard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful careful come bildad boy say your last luck to ye starbuck luck to ye mr stubb luck to ye mr flask good bye and good luck to ye all and this day three year i ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently i hope ye ll have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he need and ye ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go be careful in the hunt ye mate don t stave the boat needlessly ye harpooneer good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year don t forget your prayer either mr starbuck mind that cooper don t waste the spare stave oh the sail needle are in the green locker don t whale it too much a lord s day men but don t miss a fair chance either that s rejecting heaven s good gift have an eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it wa a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the island mr flask beware of fornication good bye good bye don t keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr starbuck it ll spoil be careful with the butter twenty cent the pound it wa and mind ye if come come captain bildad stop palavering away and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hull wildly rolled we gave three heavy hearted cheer and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic chapter the lee shore some chapter back one bulkington wa spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn when on that shivering winter s night the pequod thrust her vindictive bow into the cold malicious wave who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in mid winter just landed from a four year dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his foot wonderfullest thing are ever the unmentionable deep memory yield no epitaph this six inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say that it fared with him a with the storm tossed ship that miserably drive along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blanket friend all that s kind to our mortality but in that gale the port the land is that ship s direst jeopardy she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowd all sail off shore in so doing fight gainst the very wind that fain would blow her homeward seek all the lashed sea s landlessness again for refuge s sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe know ye now bulkington glimpse do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest wind of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore but a in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite a god so better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for worm like then oh who would craven crawl to land terror of the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy ocean perishing straight up leap thy apotheosis chapter the advocate a queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and a this business of whaling ha somehow come to be regarded among landsman a a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsman of the injustice hereby done to u hunter of whale in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal profession if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merit were he presented to the company a a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officer he should append the initial s w f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed pre eminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world decline honoring u whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amount to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilement butcher we are that is true but butcher also and butcher of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commander whom the world invariably delight to honor and a for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain fact hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whale ship at least among the cleanliest thing of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery deck of a whale ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle field from which so many soldier return to drink in all lady plaudit and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier s profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who ha freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale s vast tail fanning into eddy the air over his head for what are the comprehensible terror of man compared with the interlinked terror and wonder of god but though the world scout at u whale hunter yet doe it unwittingly pay u the profoundest homage yea an all abounding adoration for almost all the taper lamp and candle that burn round the globe burn a before so many shrine to our glory but look at this matter in other light weigh it in all sort of scale see what we whalemen are and have been why did the dutch in de witt s time have admiral of their whaling fleet why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit out whaling ship from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of family from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the year and pay to her whalemen in bounty upwards of and lastly how come it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessel manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming of dollar the ship worth at the time of sailing and every year importing into our harbor a well reaped harvest of how come all this if there be not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half look again i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher can not for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty year ha operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and another it ha begotten event so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issue that whaling may well be regarded a that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these thing let a handful suffice for many year past the whale ship ha been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known part of the earth she ha explored sea and archipelago which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if american and european men of war now peacefully ride in once savage harbor let them fire salute to the honor and glory of the whale ship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savage they may celebrate a they will the hero of exploring expedition your cook your krusensterns but i say that score of anonymous captain have sailed out of nantucket that were a great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless empty handedness they in the heathenish sharked water and by the beach of unrecorded javelin island battled with virgin wonder and terror that cook with all his marine and musket would not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyage those thing were but the life time commonplace of our heroic nantucketers often adventure which vancouver dedicates three chapter to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship s common log ah the world oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial wa carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish province on the pacific coast it wa the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those colony and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those part that great america on the other side of the sphere australia wa given to the enlightened world by the whaleman after it first blunder born discovery by a dutchman all other ship long shunned those shore a pestiferously barbarous but the whale ship touched there the whale ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrant were several time saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their water the uncounted isle of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale ship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many case carried the primitive missionary to their first destination if that double bolted land japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling ha no sthetically noble association connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lance with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time the whale ha no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a whaling voyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the word from other the norwegian whale hunter of those time and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devil they have no good blood in their vein no good blood in their vein they have something better than royal blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin wa mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settler of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneer all kith and kin to noble benjamin this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old english statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish oh that s only nominal the whale himself ha never figured in any grand imposing way the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty triumph given to a roman general upon his entering the world s capital the bone of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession see subsequent chapter for something more on this head grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heaven attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in his lifetime ha taken three hundred and fifty whale i account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking a many walled town and a for me if by any possibility there be any a yet undiscovered prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone if at my death my executor or more properly my creditor find any precious ms in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling for a whale ship wa my yale college and my harvard chapter postscript in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated fact but after embattling his fact an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his cause such an advocate would he not be blameworthy it is well known that at the coronation of king and queen even modern one a certain curious process of seasoning them for their function is gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state how they use the salt precisely who know certain i am however that a king s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even a a head of salad can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making it interior run well a they anoint machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smell of that anointing in truth a mature man who us hair oil unless medicinally that man ha probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere a a general rule he can t amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here is this what kind of oil is used at coronation certainly it can not be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bear s oil nor train oil nor cod liver oil what then can it possibly be but sperm oil in it unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oil think of that ye loyal briton we whalemen supply your king and queen with coronation stuff chapter knight and squire the chief mate of the pequod wa starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he wa a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitude his flesh being hard a twice baked biscuit transported to the indie his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast day for which his state is famous only some thirty arid summer had he seen those summer had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxiety and care than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it wa merely the condensation of the man he wa by no mean ill looking quite the contrary his pure tight skin wa an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long age to come and to endure always a now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality wa warranted to do well in all climate looking into his eye you seemed to see there the yet lingering image of those thousand fold peril he had calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part wa a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sound yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain quality in him which at time affected and in some case seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organization seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portent and inward presentiment were his and if at time these thing bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his far away domestic memory of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influence which in some honest hearted men restrain the gush of dare devil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitude of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage wa that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is a careful a man a you ll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely mean when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck wa no crusader after peril in him courage wa not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasion besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage wa one of the great staple outfit of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whale after sun down nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whale for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundred of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom wa his own father s where in the bottomless deep could he find the torn limb of his brother with memory like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness a ha been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it wa not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experience and remembrance a he had it wa not in nature that these thing should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstance would break out from it confinement and burn all his courage up and brave a he might be it wa that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with sea or wind or whale or any of the ordinary irrational horror of the world yet can not withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terror which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbuck s fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable a joint stock company and nation knave fool and murderer there may be men may have mean and meagre face but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellow should run to throw their costliest robe that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within u that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor ruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraiding against the permitting star but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of king and robe but that

according to local usage wa called a cape cod man a happy go lucky neither craven nor valiant taking peril a they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected a a journeyman joiner engaged for the year good humored easy and careless he presided over his whale boat a if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guest he wa a particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat a an old stage driver is about the snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off handedly a a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tune while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaw of death into an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner what perhaps with other thing made stubb such an easy going unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlar all bowed to the ground with their pack what helped to bring about that almost impious good humor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black little pipe wa one of the regular feature of his face you would almost a soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose a without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipe there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his leg into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one know that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless misery of the numberless mortal who have died exhaling it and a in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouth so likewise against all mortal tribulation stubb s tobacco smoke might have operated a a sort of disinfecting agent the third mate wa flask a native of tisbury in martha s vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whale who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathan had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it wa a sort of point of honor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost wa he to all sense of reverence for the many marvel of their majestic bulk and mystic way and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale wa but a specie of magnified mouse or at least water rat requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whale he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three year voyage round cape horn wa only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time a a carpenter s nail are divided into wrought nail and cut nail so mankind may be similarly divided little flask wa one of the wrought one made to clinch tight and last long they called him king post on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic whaler and which by the mean of many radiating side timber inserted into it serf to brace the ship against the icy concussion of those battering sea now these three mate starbuck stubb and flask were momentous men they it wa who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod s boat a headsman in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his force to descend on the whale these three headsman were a captain of company or being armed with their long keen whaling spear they were a a picked trio of lancer even a the harpooneer were flingers of javelin and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by his boat steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjuncture provides him with a fresh lance when the former one ha been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover a there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the pequod s harpooneer were and to what headsman each of them belonged first of all wa queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire but queequeg is already known next wa tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of martha s vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which ha long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneer in the fishery they usually go by the generic name of gay header tashtego s long lean sable hair his high cheek bone and black rounding eye for an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their glittering expression all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunter who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forest of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beast of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whale of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sire to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limb you would almost have credited the superstition of some of the earlier puritan and half believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the power of the air tashtego wa stubb the second mate s squire third among the harpooneer wa daggoo a gigantic coal black negro savage with a lion like tread an ahasuerus to behold suspended from his ear were two golden hoop so large that the sailor called them ring bolt and would talk of securing the top sail halyard to them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbor most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many year the bold life of the fishery in the ship of owner uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtue and erect a a giraffe moved about the deck in all the pomp of six foot five in his sock there wa a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo wa the squire of little flask who looked like a chess man beside him a for the residue of the pequod s company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery are american born though pretty nearly all the officer are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery a with the american army and military and merchant navy and the engineering force employed in the construction of the american canal and railroad the same i say because in all these case the native american liberally provides the brain the rest of the world a generously supplying the muscle no small number of these whaling seaman belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whaler frequently touch to augment their crew from the hardy peasant of those rocky shore in like manner the greenland whaler sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland island to receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but islander seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islander in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isle of the sea and all the end of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the world s grievance before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back black little pip he never did oh no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim pequod s forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarter deck on high he wa bid strike in with angel and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there chapter ahab for several day after leaving nantucket nothing above hatch wa seen of captain ahab the mate regularly relieved each other at the watch and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commander of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with order so sudden and peremptory that after all it wa plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator wa there though hitherto unseen by any eye not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my watch below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation this wa strangely heightened at time by the ragged elijah s diabolical incoherence uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of but poorly could i withstand them much a in other mood i wa almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicality of that outlandish prophet of the wharf but whatever it wa of apprehensiveness or uneasiness to call it so which i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotion for though the harpooneer with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchant ship company which my previous experience had made me acquainted with still i ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it wa especially the aspect of the three chief officer of the ship the mate which wa most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgiving and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely sea officer and men each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every one of them american a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all it intolerable weather behind u it wa one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough morning of the transition when with a fair wind the ship wa rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that a i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon a i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shiver ran over me reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarter deck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire ha overrunningly wasted all the limb without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cellini s cast perseus threading it way out from among his grey hair and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rod like mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly dart down it and without wrenching a single twig peel and groove out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded whether that mark wa born with him or whether it wa the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion wa made to it especially by the mate but once tashtego s senior an old gay head indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he wa full forty year old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old sea tradition the immemorial credulity popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural power of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid out which might hardly come to pas so he muttered then whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birth mark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moment i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness wa owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale s jaw aye he wa dismasted off japan said the old gay head indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it he ha a quiver of em i wa struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of the pequod s quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shroud there wa an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ship s ever pitching prow there wa an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his officer say aught to him though by all their minutest gesture and expression they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled master eye and not only that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he wa every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivot hole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck a the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse a if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pas that he wa almost continually in the air but a yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed a unnecessary there a another mast but the pequod wa only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mate were fully competent to so that there wa little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the cloud that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow a ever all cloud choose the loftiest peak to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood for a when the red cheeked dancing girl april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic wood even the barest ruggedest most thunder cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprout to welcome such glad hearted visitant so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile chapter enter ahab to him stubb some day elapsed and ice and iceberg all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reign on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant day were a crystal goblet of persian sherbet heaped up flaked up with rose water snow the starred and stately night seemed haughty dame in jewelled velvet nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earl the golden helmeted sun for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome day and such seducing night but all the witchery of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spell and potency to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hour of eve came on then memory shot her crystal a the clear ice most form of noiseless twilight and all these subtle agency more and more they wrought on ahab s texture old age is always wakeful a if the longer linked with life the less man ha to do with aught that look like death among sea commander the old greybeard will oftenest leave their berth to visit the night cloaked deck it wa so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visit were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the plank it feel like going down into one s tomb he would mutter to himself for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my grave dug berth so almost every twenty four hour when the watch of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumber of the band below and when if a rope wa to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailor flung it not rudely down a by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to it place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmate when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considering touch of humanity wa in him for at time like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter deck because to his wearied mate seeking repose within six inch of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dream would have been on the crunching teeth of shark but once the mood wa on him too deep for common regardings and a with heavy lumber like pace he wa measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab wa pleased to walk the plank then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then am i a cannon ball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy way i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such a ye sleep between shroud to use ye to the filling one at last down dog and kennel starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb wa speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir avast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away a if to avoid some passionate temptation no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely be called a dog sir then be called ten time a donkey and a mule and an as and begone or i ll clear the world of thee a he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terror in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated i wa never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb a he found himself descending the cabin scuttle it s very queer stop stubb somehow now i don t well know whether to go back and strike him or what s that down here on my knee and pray for him yes that wa the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray it s queer very queer and he s queer too aye take him fore and aft he s about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at me his eye like powder pan is he mad anyway there s something on his mind a sure a there must be something on a deck when it crack he aint in his bed now either more than three hour out of the twenty four and he don t sleep then didn t that dough boy the steward tell me that of a morning he always find the old man s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheet down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knot and the pillow a sort of frightful hot a though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess he s got what some folk ashore call a conscience it s a kind of tic dolly row they say worse nor a toothache well well i don t know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it he s full of riddle i wonder what he go into the after hold for every night a dough boy tell me he suspect what s that for i should like to know who s made appointment with him in the hold ain t that queer now but there s no telling it s the old game here go for a snooze damn me it s worth a fellow s while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it that s about the first thing baby do and that s a sort of queer too damn me but all thing are queer come to think of em but that s against my principle think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfth so here go again but how s that didn t he call me a dog blaze he called me ten time a donkey and piled a lot of jackass on top of that he might a well have kicked me and done with it maybe he did kick me and i didn t observe it i wa so taken all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the devil s the matter with me i don t stand right on my leg coming afoul of that old man ha a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming though how how how but the only way s to stash it so here go to hammock again and in the morning i ll see how this plaguey juggling think over by daylight chapter the pipe when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwark and then a had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked in old norse time the throne of the sea loving danish king were fabricated saith tradition of the tusk of the narwhale how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bone without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathan wa ahab some moment passed during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puff which blew back again into his face how now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuring aye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiff a if like the dying whale my final jet were the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapor among mild white hair not among torn iron grey lock like mine i ll smoke no more he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the wave the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the plank chapter queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask such a queer dream king post i never had you know the old man s ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what wa still more curious flask you know how curious all dream are through all this rage that i wa in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it wa not much of an insult that kick from ahab why think i what s the row it s not a real leg only a false leg and there s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump that s what make a blow from the hand flask fifty time more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living member that make the living insult my little man and think i to myself all the while mind while i wa stubbing my silly toe against that cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory wa it all all the while i say i wa thinking to myself what s his leg now but a cane a whalebone cane yes think i it wa only a playful cudgelling in fact only a whaleboning that he gave me not a base kick besides think i look at it once why the end of it the foot part what a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me there s a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only but now come the greatest joke of the dream flask while i wa battering away at the pyramid a sort of badger haired old merman with a hump on his back take me by the shoulder and slew me round what are you bout say he slid man but i wa frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i wa over the fright what am i about say i at last and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout what do you think i saw why thunder alive man his stern wa stuck full of marlinspike with the point out say i on second thought i guess i won t kick you old fellow wise stubb said he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gum like a chimney hag seeing he wasn t going to stop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might a well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa say i what s the matter now old fellow look ye here say he let s argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didn t he yes he did say i right here it wa very good say he he used his ivory leg didn t he yes he did say i well then say he wise stubb what have you to complain of didn t he kick with right good will it wasn t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with wa it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb it s an honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old england the greatest lord think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garter knight of but be your boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say be kicked by him account his kick honor and on no account kick back for you can t help yourself wise stubb don t you see that pyramid with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i wa in my hammock now what do you think of that dream flask i don t know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho may be may be but it s made a wise man of me flask d ye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he say halloa what s that he shout hark mast head there look sharp all of ye there are whale hereabouts if ye see a white one split your lung for him what do you think of that now flask ain t there a small drop of something queer about that eh a white whale did ye mark that man look ye there s something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab ha that that s bloody on his mind but mum he come this way chapter cetology already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in it unshored harbourless immensity ere that come to pas ere the pequod s weedy hull roll side by side with the barnacled hull of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelation and allusion of all sort which are to follow it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genus that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the classification of the constituent of a chaos nothing less is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authority have laid down no branch of zoology is so much involved a that which is entitled cetology say captain scoresby a d it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry a to the true method of dividing the cetacea into group and family utter confusion exists among the historian of this animal sperm whale say surgeon beale a d unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable water impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field strewn with thorn all these incomplete indication but serve to torture u naturalist thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those light of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of book there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whale many are the men small and great old and new landsman and seaman who have at large or in little written of the whale run over a few the author of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linn u rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lac p de bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extract will show of the name in this list of whale author only those following owen ever saw living whale and but one of them wa a real professional harpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or right whale he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and say nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the sea he is not even by any mean the largest of the whale yet owing to the long priority of his claim and the profound ignorance which till some seventy year back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale and which ignorance to this present day still reign in all but some few scientific retreat and whale port this usurpation ha been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusion in the great poet of past day will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival wa to them the monarch of the sea but the time ha at last come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people all the greenland whale is deposed the great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two book in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those book are beale s and bennett s both in their time surgeon to english south sea whale ship and both exact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volume is necessarily small but so far a it go it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description a yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic life not complete in any literature far above all other hunted whale his is an unwritten life now the various specie of whale need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all it department by subsequent laborer a no better man advance to take this matter in hand i hereupon offer my own poor endeavor i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various specie or in this place at least to much of any description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder but it is a ponderous task no ordinary letter sorter in the post office is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have one s hand among the unspeakable foundation rib and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful taunting in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through library and sailed through ocean i have had to do with whale with these visible hand i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminary to settle first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarter it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of nature a d linn u declares i hereby separate the whale from the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year shark and shad alewife and herring against linn u s express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same sea with the leviathan the ground upon which linn u would fain have banished the whale from the water he state a follows on account of their warm bilocular heart their lung their movable eyelid their hollow ear penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege natur jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friend simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmate of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reason set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect doe the whale differ from other fish above linn u ha given you those item but in brief they are these lung and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next how shall we define the whale by his obvious external so a conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail there you have him however contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation a walrus spout much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is still more cogent a coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsman have not a flat but a vertical or up and down tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no mean exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded a alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology now then come the grand division of the entire whale host i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and dugong pig fish and sow fish of the coffin of nantucket are included by many naturalist among the whale but a these pig fish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouth of river and feeding on wet hay and especially a they do not spout i deny their credential a whale and have presented them with their passport to quit the kingdom of cetology first according to magnitude i divide the whale into three primary book subdivisible into chapter and these shall comprehend them all both small and large i the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale a the type of the folio i present the sperm whale of the octavo the grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise folio among these i here include the following chapter i the sperm whale ii the right whale iii the fin back whale iv the hump backed whale v the razor back whale vi the sulphur bottom whale book i folio chapter i sperm whale this whale among the english of old vaguely known a the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the german and the macrocephalus of the long word he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whale to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarity will in many other place be enlarged upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it is absurd some century ago when the sperm whale wa almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil wa only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those day spermaceti it would seem wa popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england a the greenland or right whale it wa the idea also that this same spermaceti wa that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally express in those time also spermaceti wa exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only a an ointment and medicament it wa only to be had from the druggist a you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when a i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known it original name wa still retained by the dealer no doubt to enhance it value by a notion so strangely significant of it scarcity and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti wa really derived book i folio chapter ii right whale in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathan being the one first regularly hunted by man it yield the article commonly known a whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known a whale oil an inferior article in commerce among the fisherman he is indiscriminately designated by all the following title the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the specie thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in the second specie of my folio it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalist the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swede it is the whale which for more than two century past ha been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic sea it is the whale which the american fisherman have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil bank on the nor west coast and various other part of the world designated by them right whale cruising ground some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the american but they precisely agree in all their grand feature nor ha there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivision based upon the most inconclusive difference that some department of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale book i folio chapter iii fin back under this head i reckon a monster which by the various name of fin back tall spout and long john ha been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passenger crossing the atlantic in the new york packet track in the length he attains and in his baleen the fin back resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lip present a cable like aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting fold of large wrinkle his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some three or four foot long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at time be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripple and this gnomon like fin stand up and cast shadow upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with it style and wavy hour line graved on it on that ahaz dial the shadow often go back the fin back is not gregarious he seems a whale hater a some men are man hater very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen water his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming a to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the fin back is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic specie denominated whalebone whale that is whale with baleen of these so called whalebone whale there would seem to be several variety most of which however are little known broad nosed whale and beaked whale pike headed whale bunched whale under jawed whale and rostrated whale are the fisherman s name for a few sort in connection with this appellative of whalebone whale it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusion to some kind of whale yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked part or feature very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinction which the whale in his kind present how then the baleen hump back fin and teeth these are thing whose peculiarity are indiscriminately dispersed among all sort of whale without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particular thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each ha a hump but there the similitude cease then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these ha baleen but there again the similitude cease and it is just the same with the other part above mentioned in various sort of whale they form such irregular combination or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation a utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the whale naturalist ha split but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal part of the whale in his anatomy there at least we shall be able to hit the right classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whale s anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowel of the various leviathan why there you will not find distinction a fiftieth part a available to the systematizer a those external one already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whale bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed book i folio chapter iv hump back this whale is often seen on the northern american coast he ha been frequently captured there and towed into harbor he ha a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular name for him doe not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also ha a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he ha baleen he is the most gamesome and light hearted of all the whale making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them book i folio chapter v razor back of this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunter and philosopher though no coward he ha never yet shown any part of him but his back which rise in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor doe anybody else book i folio chapter vi sulphur bottom another retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tile in some of his profounder diving he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern sea and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is never chased he would run away with rope walk of line prodigy are told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer thus end book i folio and now begin book ii octavo octavoes these embrace the whale of middling magnitude among which present may be numbered i the grampus ii the black fish iii the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killer why this book of whale is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while the whale of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinder s quarto volume in it dimensioned form doe not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume doe book ii octavo chapter i grampus though this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing ha furnished a proverb to landsman is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whale but possessing all the grand distinctive feature of the leviathan most naturalist have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twenty five foot in length and of corresponding dimension round the waist he swim in herd he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some fisherman his approach is regarded a premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale book ii octavo chapter ii black fish i give the popular fisherman s name for all these fish for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish so called because blackness is the rule among almost all whale so call him the hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angle of his lip are curved upwards he carry an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale average some sixteen or eighteen foot in length he is found in almost all latitude he ha a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which look something like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunter sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment a some frugal housekeeper in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whale will yield you upwards of thirty gallon of oil book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostril whale another instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen foot in length while it horn average five foot though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen foot strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found on the sinister side which ha an ill effect giving it owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left handed man what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answer it would be hard to say it doe not seem to be used like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailor tell me that the narwhale employ it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin said it wa used for an ice piercer for the narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrust his horn up and so break through but you can not prove either of these surmise to be correct my own opinion is that however this one sided horn may really be used by the narwhale however that may be it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlet the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old author i have gathered that this same sea unicorn s horn wa in ancient day regarded a the great antidote against poison and a such preparation of it brought immense price it wa also distilled to a volatile salt for fainting lady the same way that the horn of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it wa in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tell me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace a his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knee he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knee did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature the narwhale ha a very picturesque leopard like look being of a milk white ground colour dotted with round and oblong spot of black his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar sea book ii octavo chapter iv killer of this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he wa about the bigness of a grampus he is very savage a sort of feegee fish he sometimes take the great folio whale by the lip and hang there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he ha exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of it indistinctness for we are all killer on land and on sea bonaparte and shark included book ii octavo chapter v thrasher this gentleman is famous for his tail which he us for a ferule in thrashing his foe he mount the folio whale s back and a he swim he work his passage by flogging him a some schoolmaster get along in the world by a similar process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaw even in the lawless sea thus end book ii octavo and begin book iii duodecimo duodecimoes these include the smaller whale i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy mouthed porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fish not commonly exceeding four or five foot should be marshalled among whale a word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creature set down above a duodecimoes are infallibly whale by the term of my definition of what a whale is i e a spouting fish with a horizontal tail book iii duodecimo chapter huzza porpoise this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoise and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always swim in hilarious shoal which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like cap in a fourth of july crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine spirit they invariably come from the breezy billow to windward they are the lad that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheer at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a well fed plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaw is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jeweller and watchmaker sailor put it on their hone porpoise meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spout indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise a pirate very savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many time but never yet saw him captured book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealy mouthed porpoise the largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far a it is known the only english name by which he ha hitherto been designated is that of the fisher right whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentleman like figure he ha no fin on his back most other porpoise have he ha a lovely tail and sentimental indian eye of a hazel hue but his mealy mouth spoil all though his entire back down to his side fin is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct a the mark in a ship s hull called the bright waist that line streak him from stem to stern with two separate colour black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which make him look a if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal bag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise beyond the duodecimo this system doe not proceed inasmuch a the porpoise is the smallest of the whale above you have all the leviathan of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive half fabulous whale which a an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their fore castle appellation for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigator who may complete what i have here but begun if any of the following whale shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitude the bottle nose whale the junk whale the pudding headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authority there might be quoted other list of uncertain whale blessed with all manner of uncouth name but i omit them a altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sound full of leviathanism but signifying nothing finally it wa stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected you can not but plainly see that i have kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even a the great cathedral of cologne wa left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small erection may be finished by their first architect grand one true one ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing anything this whole book is but a draught nay but the draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience chapter the specksnyder concerning the officer of the whale craft this seems a good a place a any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship board arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officer a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale fleet the large importance attached to the harpooneer s vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two century and more ago the command of a whale ship wa not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but wa divided between him and an officer called the specksnyder literally this word mean fat cutter usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in those day the captain s authority wa restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whale hunting department and all it concern the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he rank simply a senior harpooneer and a such is but one of the captain s more inferior subaltern nevertheless a upon the good conduct of the harpooneer the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstance night watch on a whaling ground the command of the ship s deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demand that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished a their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded a their social equal now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is this the first life aft the last forward hence in whale ship and merchantman alike the mate have their quarter with the captain and so too in most of the american whaler the harpooneer are lodged in the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meal in the captain s cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyage now or ever made by man the peculiar peril of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their profit not upon fixed wage but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these thing do in some case tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantman generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instance live together for all that the punctilious external at least of the quarter deck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ship in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost a much outward homage a if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot cloth and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod wa the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted wa implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoe from his foot ere stepping upon the quarter deck and though there were time when owing to peculiar circumstance connected with event hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual term whether of condescension or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab wa by no mean unobservant of the paramount form and usage of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those form and usage a it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private end than they were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those form that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship for be a man s intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external art and entrenchment always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever keep god s true prince of the empire from the world s hustings and leaf the highest honor that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small thing when extreme political superstition invest them that in some royal instance even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency but when a in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herd crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in it fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art a the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still move before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperor and king i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale hunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trapping and housing are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it must need be plucked at from the sky and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air chapter the cabin table it is noon and dough boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf of bread face from the cabin scuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarter boat ha just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shroud he swing himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr starbuck disappears into the cabin when the last echo of his sultan s step ha died away and starbuck the first emir ha every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rous from his quietude take a few turn along the plank and after a grave peep into the binnacle say with some touch of pleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounge about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise take up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessor but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarter deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sort of knowing wink in all sort of direction and kicking off his shoe he strike into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk s head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he go down rollicking so far at least a he remains visible from the deck reversing all other procession by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pause ship a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahab s presence in the character of abjectus or the slave it is not the least among the strange thing bred by the intense artificialness of sea usage that while in the open air of the deck some officer will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officer the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander s cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him a he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner table of invited guest that man s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that man s royalty of state transcends belshazzar s for belshazzar wa not the greatest who ha but once dined his friend ha tasted what it is to be c sar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship master then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea life just mentioned over his ivory inlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sea lion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cub in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served they were a little child before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eye all fastened upon the old man s knife a he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic a the weather no and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef wa locked ahab thereby motioned starbuck s plate towards him the mate received his meat a though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial elector so these cabin meal were somehow solemn meal eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself wa dumb what a relief it wa to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he wa the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shinbone of the saline beef his would have been the drumstick for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chance were ahab had never so much a noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owner of the ship denied it to him on account of it clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless water butter wa at a premium and therefore wa not for him a subaltern however it wa flask ala wa a butterless man another thing flask wa the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up consider for hereby flask s dinner wa badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon show symptom of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthful that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it wa that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it wa to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger a keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of old fashioned beef in the forecastle a i used to when i wa before the mast there s the fruit of promotion now there s the vanity of glory there s the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask s official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance wa to go aft at dinner time and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky light sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab now ahab and his three mate formed what may be called the first table in the pequod s cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth wa cleared or rather wa restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneer were bidden to the feast they being it residuary legatee they made a sort of temporary servant hall of the high and mighty cabin in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain s table wa the entire care free license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellow the harpooneer while their master the mate seemed afraid of the sound of the hinge of their own jaw the harpooneer chewed their food with such a relish that there wa a report to it they dined like lord they filled their belly like indian ship all day loading with spice such portentous appetite had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancy made by the previous repast often the pale dough boy wa fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hop skip and jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoon wise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted dough boy s memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he wa naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this bread faced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitation of these three savage dough boy s whole life wa one continual lip quiver commonly after seeing the harpooneer furnished with all thing they demanded he would escape from their clutch into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blind of it door till all wa over it wa a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indian s crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limb making the low cabin framework to shake a when an african elephant go passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro wa wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthful he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostril snuffed in the sublime life of the world not by beef or by bread are giant made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough so much so that the trembling dough boy almost looked to see whether any mark of teeth lurked in his own lean arm and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bone might be picked the simple witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fit of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneer carried in their pocket for their lance and other weapon and with which whetstone at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knife that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy how could he forget that in his island day queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretion ala dough boy hard fare the white waiter who wait upon cannibal not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three salt sea warrior would rise and depart to his credulous fable mongering ear all their martial bone jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbard but though these barbarian dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habit they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtime and just before sleeping time when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarter in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captain who a a set rather incline to the opinion that by right the ship s cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mate and harpooneer of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it wa something a a street door enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and a a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin wa no companionship socially ahab wa inaccessible though nominally included in the census of christendom he wa still an alien to it he lived in the world a the last of the grisly bear lived in settled missouri and a when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the wood burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paw so in his inclement howling old age ahab s soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paw of it gloom chapter the mast head it wa during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seaman my first mast head came round in most american whalemen the mast head are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel s leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand mile and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three four or five year voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her say an empty vial even then her mast head are kept manned to the last and not till her skysail pole sail in among the spire of the port doe she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more now a the business of standing mast head ashore or afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let u in some measure expatiate here i take it that the earliest stander of mast head were the old egyptian because in all my research i find none prior to them for though their progenitor the builder of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest mast head in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck wa put to it a that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of god s wrath therefore we can not give these babel builder priority over the egyptian and that the egyptian were a nation of mast head stander is an assertion based upon the general belief among arch ologists that the first pyramid were founded for astronomical purpose a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair like formation of all four side of those edifice whereby with prodigious long uplifting of their leg those old astronomer were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new star even a the look out of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylite the famous christian hermit of old time who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on it summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander of mast head who wa not to be driven from his place by fog or frost rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post of modern stander of mast head we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stand with arm folded some one hundred and fifty foot in the air careless now who rule the deck below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stand high aloft on his towering main mast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillar his column mark that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortal will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun metal stand his mast head in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsel the distracted deck upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirit penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoal and what rock must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast head stander of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stand accountable the worthy obed tell u that in the early time of the whale fishery ere ship were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spar along the sea coast to which the look out ascended by mean of nailed cleat something a fowl go upstairs in a hen house a few year ago this same plan wa adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the ready manned boat nigh the beach but this custom ha now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper mast head that of a whale ship at sea the three mast head are kept manned from sun rise to sun set the seaman taking their regular turn a at the helm and relieving each other every two hour in the serene weather of the tropic it is exceedingly pleasant the mast head nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred foot above the silent deck striding along the deep a if the mast were gigantic stilt while beneath you and between your leg a it were swim the hugest monster of the sea even a ship once sailed between the boot of the famous colossus at old rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the wave the tranced ship indolently roll the drowsy trade wind blow everything resolve you into languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazette extra with startling account of commonplace never delude you into unnecessary excitement you hear of no domestic affliction bankrupt security fall of stock are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner for all your meal for three year and more are snugly stowed in cask and your bill of fare is immutable in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four year voyage a often happens the sum of the various hour you spend at the mast head would amount to several entire month and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such a pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivance in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallant mast where you stand upon two thin parallel stick almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallant cross tree here tossed about by the sea the beginner feel about a cosy a he would standing on a bull s horn to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watch coat but properly speaking the thickest watch coat is no more of a house than the unclad body for a the soul is glued inside of it fleshy tabernacle and can not freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alp in winter so a watch coat is not so much of a house a it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you can not put a shelf or chest of drawer in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch coat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast head of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tent or pulpit called crow s nest in which the look out of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen sea in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the iceberg in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the re discovery of the lost icelandic colony of old greenland in this admirable volume all stander of mast head are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow s nest of the glacier which wa the name of captain sleet s good craft he called it the sleet s crow s nest in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own child after our own name we father being the original inventor and patentee so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the sleet s crow s nest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable side screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little trap hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrella comforter and coat in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical convenience when captain sleet in person stood his mast head in this crow s nest of his he tell u that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhale or vagrant sea unicorn infesting those water for you can not successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it wa plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe a he doe all the little detailed convenience of his crow s nest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treat u to a very scientific account of his experiment in this crow s nest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the error resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnet an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship s plank and in the glacier s case perhaps to there having been so many broken down blacksmith among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviation azimuth compass observation and approximate error he know very well captain sleet that he wa not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditation a to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case bottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow s nest within easy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case bottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with mittened finger and hooded head he wa studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird s nest within three or four perch of the pole but if we southern whale fisher are not so snugly housed aloft a captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counter balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive sea in which we south fisher mostly float for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pasture and so at last mount to my ultimate destination let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could i being left completely to myself at such a thought engendering altitude how could i but lightly hold my obligation to observe all whale ship standing order keep your weather eye open and sing out every time and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye ship owner of nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fishery any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offer to ship with the ph don instead of bowditch in his head beware of such an one i say your whale must be seen before they can be killed and this sunken eyed young platonist will tow you ten wake round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these monition at all unneeded for nowadays the whale fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent minded young men disgusted with the carking care of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perch himself upon the mast head of some luckless disappointed whale ship and in moody phrase ejaculate roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubber hunter sweep over thee in vain very often do the captain of such ship take those absent minded young philosopher to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage half hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition a that in their secret soul they would rather not see whale than otherwise but all in vain those young platonist have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are short sighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have left their opera glass at home why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lad we ve been cruising now hard upon three year and thou hast not raised a whale yet whale are scarce a hen s teeth whenever thou art up here perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoal of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opium like listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absent minded youth by the blending cadence of wave with thought that at last he loses his identity take the mystic ocean at his foot for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange half seen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimly discovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thought that only people the soul by continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebb away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like cranmer s sprinkled pantheistic ash forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tide of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity come back in horror over descartian vortex you hover and perhaps at mid day in the fairest weather with one half throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheist chapter the quarter deck enter ahab then all it wa not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab a wa his wont ascended the cabin gangway to the deck there most sea captain usually walk at that hour a country gentleman after the same meal take a few turn in the garden soon his steady ivory stride wa heard a to and fro he paced his old round upon plank so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stone with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger foot print the foot print of his one unsleeping ever pacing thought but on the occasion in question those dent looked deeper even a his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought wa ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the main mast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him a he turned and pace in him a he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement d ye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick that s in him peck the shell twill soon be out the hour wore on ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwark and inserting his bone leg into the auger hole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship board except in some extraordinary case send everybody aft repeated ahab mast head there come down when the entire ship s company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive face were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwark and then darting his eye among the crew started from his standpoint and a though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turn upon the deck with bent head and half slouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried what do ye do when ye see a whale men sing out for him wa the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voice good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tone observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them and what do ye next men lower away and after him and what tune is it ye pull to men a dead whale or a stove boat more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariner began to gaze curiously at each other a if marvelling how it wa that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless question but they were all eagerness again a ahab now half revolving in his pivot hole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus all ye mast header have before now heard me give order about a white whale look ye d ye see this spanish ounce of gold holding up a broad bright coin to the sun it is a sixteen dollar piece men d ye see it mr starbuck hand me yon top maul while the mate wa getting the hammer ahab without speaking wa slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirt of his jacket a if to heighten it lustre and without using any word wa meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheel of his vitality in him receiving the top maul from starbuck he advanced towards the main mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raise me a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raise me that white headed whale with three hole punctured in his starboard fluke look ye whosoever of ye raise me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boy huzza huzza cried the seaman a with swinging tarpaulin they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast it s a white whale i say resumed ahab a he threw down the topmaul a white whale skin your eye for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started a if each wa separately touched by some specific recollection captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash doe he fan tail a little curious sir before he go down said the gay header deliberately and ha he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab and he have one two three oh good many iron in him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twiske tee be twisk like him him faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round a though uncorking a bottle like him him corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoon lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white a a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep shearing aye tashtego and he fan tail like a split jib in a squall death and devil men it is moby dick ye have seen moby dick moby dick captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain ahab i have heard of moby dick but it wa not moby dick that took off thy leg who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it wa moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart stricken moose aye aye it wa that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arm with measureless imprecation he shouted out aye aye and i ll chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition s flame before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both side of land and over all side of earth till he spout black blood and roll fin out what say ye men will ye splice hand on it now i think ye do look brave aye aye shouted the harpooneer and seaman running closer to the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but what s this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for moby dick i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaw of death too captain ahab if it fairly come in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whale not my commander s vengeance how many barrel will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if money s to be the measurer man and the accountant have computed their great counting house the globe by girdling it with guinea one to every three part of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here he smites his chest whispered stubb what s that for methinks it ring most vast but hollow vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous hark ye yet again the little lower layer all visible object man are but a pasteboard mask but in each event in the living act the undoubted deed there some unknown but still reasoning thing put forth the moulding of it feature from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think there s naught beyond but ti enough he task me he heap me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy man i d strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creation but not my master man is even that fair play who s over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye more intolerable than fiend glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat ha melted thee to anger glow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm word are small indignity i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheek of spotted tawn living breathing picture painted by the sun the pagan leopard the unrecking and unworshipping thing that live and seek and give no reason for the torrid life they feel the crew man the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale see stubb he laugh see yonder chilian he snort to think of it stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling can not starbuck and what is it reckon it ti but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back when every foremast hand ha clutched a whetstone ah constrainings seize thee i see the billow lift thee speak but speak aye aye thy silence then that voice thee aside something shot from my dilated nostril he ha inhaled it in his lung starbuck now is mine can not oppose me now without rebellion god keep me keep u all murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibration of the wind in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sail against the mast a for a moment their heart sank in for again starbuck s downcast eye lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the wind blew on the sail filled out the ship heaved and rolled a before ah ye admonition and warning why stay ye not when ye come but rather are ye prediction than warning ye shadow yet not so much prediction from without a verification of the foregoing thing within for with little external to constrain u the innermost necessity in our being these still drive u on the measure the measure cried ahab receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneer he ordered them to produce their weapon then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoon in their hand while his three mate stood at his side with their lance and the rest of the ship s company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eye met his a the bloodshot eye of the prairie wolf meet the eye of their leader ere he rush on at their head in the trail of the bison but ala only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian drink and pas he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman the crew alone

yet see that ha boy come back bad penny come not sooner hand it me why now this pewter had run brimming again wer t not thou st vitus imp away thou ague advance ye mate cross your lance full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the three level radiating lance at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed a though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life the three mate quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright in vain cried ahab but maybe ti well for did ye three but once take the full forced shock then mine own electric thing that had perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye dead perchance ye need it

dick to his death the long barbed steel goblet were lifted and to cry and malediction against the white whale the spirit were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss starbuck paled and turned and shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the round among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and ahab retired within his cabin chapter sunset the

chapter moby dick i ishmael wa one of that crew my shout had gone up with the rest my oath had been welded with theirs and stronger i shouted and more did i hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a wild mystical sympathetical feeling wa in me ahab s quenchless feud seemed mine with greedy ear i learned the history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oath of violence and revenge for some time past though at interval only the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized sea mostly frequented by the sperm whale fisherman but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who a yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him wa small indeed for owing to the large number of whale cruiser the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitude so a seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single news telling sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the time of sailing from home all these with other circumstance direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole world wide whaling fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it wa hardly to be doubted that several vessel reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailant had completely escaped them to some mind it wa not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick yet a of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instance of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore it wa that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunter perhaps for the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more a it were to the peril of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and a for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost a boldly and fearlessly lowered for him a for any other whale of that specie but at length such calamity did ensue in these assault not restricted to sprained wrist and ankle broken limb or devouring amputation but fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulse all accumulating and piling their terror upon moby dick those thing had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunter to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come nor did wild rumor of all sort fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true history of these deadly encounter for not only do fabulous rumor naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible event a the smitten tree give birth to it fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumor abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and a the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumor which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen a a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailor but of all sailor they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye it greatest marvel but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest water that though you sailed a thousand mile and passed a thousand shore you would not come to any chiseled hearth stone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitude and longitude pursuing too such a calling a he doe the whaleman is wrapped by influence all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery space the outblown rumor of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hint and half formed f tal suggestion of supernatural agency which eventually invested moby dick with new terror unborrowed from anything that visibly appears so that in many case such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumor at least had heard of the white whale few of those hunter were willing to encounter the peril of his jaw but there were still other and more vital practical influence at work not even at the present day ha the original prestige of the sperm whale a fearfully distinguished from all other specie of the leviathan died out of the mind of the whalemen a a body there are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would perhaps either from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nation not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatch these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tale of southern whaling nor is the pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prow which stem him and a if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary time thrown it shadow before it we find some book naturalist olassen and povelson declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious a continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time a cuvier s were these or almost similar impression effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish shark included are struck with the most lively terror and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rock with such violence a to cause instantaneous death and however the general experience in the fishery may amend such report a these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitude of their vocation revived in the mind of the hunter so that overawed by the rumor and portent concerning him not a few of the fisherman recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier day of the sperm whale fishery when it wa oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the peril of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathan might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition a the sperm whale wa not for mortal man that to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are some remarkable document that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these thing were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specific detail of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniment were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered one of the wild suggestion referred to a at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the mind of the superstitiously inclined wa the unearthly conceit that moby dick wa ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitude at one and the same instant of time nor credulous a such mind must have been wa this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for a the secret of the current in the sea have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden way of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuer and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculation regarding them especially concerning the mystic mode whereby after sounding to a great depth he transport himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant point it is a thing well known to both american and english whale ship and a well a thing placed upon authoritative record year ago by scoresby that some whale have been captured far north in the pacific in whose body have been found the barb of harpoon darted in the greenland sea nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instance it ha been declared that the interval of time between the two assault could not have exceeded very many day hence by inference it ha been believed by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a problem to man wa never a problem to the whale so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigy related in old time of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there wa said to be a lake in which the wreck of ship floated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose water were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narration are almost fully equalled by the reality of the whalemen forced into familiarity then with such prodigy a these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assault the white whale had escaped alive it can not be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstition declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though grove of spear should be planted in his flank he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billow hundred of league away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there wa enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power for it wa not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whale but a wa elsewhere thrown out a peculiar snow white wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent feature the token whereby even in the limitless uncharted sea he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him the rest of his body wa so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleaming nor wa it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror a that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific account he had over and over again evinced in his assault more than all his treacherous retreat struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuer with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several time been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boat to splinter or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several fatality had attended his chase but though similar disaster however little bruited ashore were by no mean unusual in the fishery yet in most instance such seemed the white whale s infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused wa not wholly regarded a having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitch of inflamed distracted fury the mind of his more desperate hunter were impelled when amid the chip of chewed boat and the sinking limb of torn comrade they swam out of the white curd of the whale s direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on a if at a birth or a bridal his three boat stove around him and oar and men both whirling in the eddy one captain seizing the line knife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale a an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep life of the whale that captain wa ahab and then it wa that suddenly sweeping his sickle shaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahab s leg a a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice small reason wa there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woe but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperation the white whale swam before him a the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agency which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which ha been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christian ascribe one half of the world which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring it idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torment all that stir up the lee of thing all truth with malice in it all that crack the sinew and cake the brain all the subtle demonism of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon the whale s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then a if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot heart s shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania in him took it instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long month of day and week ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape then it wa that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad that it wa only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact that at interval during the passage he wa a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and wa moreover intensified by his delirium that his mate were forced to lace him fast even there a he sailed raving in his hammock in a strait jacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gale and when running into more sufferable latitude the ship with mild stun sail spread floated across the tranquil tropic and to all appearance the old man s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swell and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected front however pale and issued his calm order once again and his mate thanked god the direful madness wa now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form ahab s full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flow narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but a in his narrow flowing monomania not one jot of ahab s broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all it concentred cannon upon it own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object this is much yet ahab s larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundity and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand however grand and wonderful now quit it and take your way ye nobler sadder soul to those vast roman hall of thermes where far beneath the fantastic tower of man s upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquity and throned on torsoes so with a broken throne the great god mock that captive king so like a caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablature of age wind ye down there ye prouder sadder soul question that proud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalty and from your grim sire only will the old state secret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my mean are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling wa only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea wa likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptom the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reason he wa all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness a the bloody hunt of whale gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fang of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brute or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underling to the attack but be all this a it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all engrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintance on shore but half dreamed of what wa lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous soul have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruise the profit to be counted down in dollar from the mint he wa intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then wa this grey headed ungodly old man chasing with curse a job s whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegade and castaway and cannibal morally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge how it wa that they so aboundingly responded to the old man s ire by what evil magic their soul were possessed that at time his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale a much their insufferable foe a his how all this came to be what the white whale wa to them or how to their unconscious understanding also in some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the sea of life all this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner that work in u all how can one tell whither lead his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his pick who doe not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow of a seventy four can stand still for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill chapter the whiteness of the whale what the white whale wa to ahab ha been hinted what at time he wa to me a yet remains unsaid aside from those more obvious consideration touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any man s soul some alarm there wa another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him which at time by it intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable wa it that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form it wa the whiteness of the whale that above all thing appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chapter might be naught though in many natural object whiteness refiningly enhances beauty a if imparting some special virtue of it own a in marble japonica and pearl and though various nation have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old king of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephant above all their other magniloquent ascription of dominion and the modern king of siam unfurling the same snow white quadruped in the royal standard and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow white charger and the great austrian empire c sarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this pre eminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness ha been even made significant of gladness for among the roman a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathy and symbolizing this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble thing the innocence of bride the benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum wa the deepest pledge of honor though in many clime whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of king and queen drawn by milk white steed though even in the higher mystery of the most august religion it ha been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian fire worshipper the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythology great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow white bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog wa by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian priest derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomp of the romish faith white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the vision of st john white robe are given to the redeemed and the four and twenty elder stand clothed in white before the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated association with whatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strike more of panic to the soul than that redness which affright in blood this elusive quality it is which cause the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly association and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bound witness the white bear of the pole and the white shark of the tropic what but their smooth flaky whiteness make them the transcendent horror they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fierce fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage a the white shrouded bear or shark with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rise from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stand invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotion in our mind the polar bear frightens u with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror a for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary mood strangely tally with the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish mass for the dead begin with requiem eternam eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habit the french call him requin bethink thee of the albatross whence come those cloud of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sail in all imagination not coleridge first threw that spell but god s great unflattering laureate nature i remember the first albatross i ever saw it wa during a prolonged gale in water hard upon the antarctic sea from my forenoon watch below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatch i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at interval it arched forth it vast archangel wing a if to embrace some holy ark wondrous fluttering and throbbing shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cry a some king s ghost in supernatural distress through it inexpressible strange eye methought i peeped to secret which took hold of god a abraham before the angel i bowed myself the white thing wa so white it wing so wide and in those for ever exiled water i had lost the miserable warping memory of tradition and of town long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i can not tell can only hint the thing that darted through me then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird wa this a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i learned that goney wa some seaman s name for albatross so that by no possibility could coleridge s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impression which were mine when i saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of term there are bird called grey albatross and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotion a when i beheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line a the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round it neck with the ship s time and place and then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man wa taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing folding the invoking and adoring cherub most famous in our western annals and indian tradition is that of the white steed of the prairie a magnificent milk white charger large eyed small headed bluff chested and with the dignity of a thousand monarch in his lofty overscorning carriage he wa the elected xerxes of vast herd of wild horse whose pasture in those day were only fenced by the rocky mountain and the alleghanies at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening lead on the host of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housing more resplendent than gold and silver beater could have furnished him a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eye of the old trapper and hunter revived the glory of those primeval time when adam walked majestic a a god bluff browed and fearless a this mighty steed whether marching amid his aide and marshal in the van of countless cohort that endlessly streamed it over the plain like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subject browsing all around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostril reddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest indian he wa the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stand on legendary record of this noble horse that it wa his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other instance where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shock the eye a that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bear the albino is a well made a other men ha no substantive deformity and yet this mere aspect of all pervading whiteness make him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so nor in quite other aspect doe nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agency fail to enlist among her force this crowning attribute of the terrible from it snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern sea ha been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instance ha the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate white hood of ghent murder their bailiff in the market place nor in some thing doe the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it can not well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there a if indeed that pallor were a much like the badge of consternation in the other world a of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstition do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantom all ghost rising in a milk white fog yea while these terror seize u let u add that even the king of terror when personified by the evangelist ride on his pallid horse therefore in his other mood symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in it profoundest idealized significance it call up a peculiar apparition to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the citation of some of those instance wherein this thing of whiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct association calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over u the same sorcery however modified can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct u to the hidden cause we seek let u try but in a matter like this subtlety appeal to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these hall and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impression about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day doe the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless procession of slow pacing pilgrim down cast and hooded with new fallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the middle american state why doe the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what is there apart from the tradition of dungeoned warrior and king which will not wholly account for it that make the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structure it neighbor the byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer tower the white mountain of new hampshire whence in peculiar mood come that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of virginia s blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitude and longitude doe the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lull u with mortal thought of long lacquered mild afternoon on the wave followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunset or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tale of central europe doe the tall pale man of the hartz forest whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glide through the green of the grove why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imp of the blocksburg nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedral toppling earthquake nor the stampedoes of her frantic sea nor the tearlessness of arid sky that never rain nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spire wrenched cope stone and cross all adroop like canted yard of anchored fleet and her suburban avenue of house wall lying over upon each other a a tossed pack of card it is not these thing alone which make tearless lima the strangest saddest city thou can st see for lima ha taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old a pizarro this whiteness keep her ruin for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spread over her broken rampart the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fix it own distortion i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of object otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearance whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statement may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following example first the mariner when drawing nigh the coast of foreign land if by night he hear the roar of breaker start to vigilance and feel just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculty but under precisely similar circumstance let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness a if from encircling headland shoal of combed white bear were swimming round him then he feel a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened water is horrible to him a a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still off sounding heart and helm they both go down he never rest till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it wa not so much the fear of striking hidden rock a the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the snow howdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitude and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitude much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference view an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the antarctic sea where at time by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the power of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbow speaking hope and solace to his misery view what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with it lean ice monument and splintered cross but thou sayest methinks that white lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont far removed from all beast of prey why is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he can not even see it but only smell it wild animal muskiness why will he start snort and with bursting eye paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any goring of wild creature in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smell can not recall to him anything associated with the experience of former peril for what know he this new england colt of the black bison of distant oregon no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousand of mile from oregon still when he smell that savage musk the rending goring bison herd are a present a to the deserted wild foal of the prairie which this instant they may be trampling into dust thus then the muffled rolling of a milky sea the bleak rustling of the festooned frost of mountain the desolate shifting of the windrowed snow of prairie all these to ishmael are a the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt though neither know where lie the nameless thing of which the mystic sign give forth such hint yet with me a with the colt somewhere those thing must exist though in many of it aspect this visible world seems formed in love the invisible sphere were formed in fright but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeal with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentous why a we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual thing nay the very veil of the christian s deity and yet should be a it is the intensifying agent in thing the most appalling to mankind is it that by it indefiniteness it shadow forth the heartless void and immensity of the universe and thus stab u from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depth of the milky way or is it that a in essence whiteness is not so much a colour a the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colour is it for these reason that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snow a colourless all colour of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosopher that all other earthly hue every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinge of sunset sky and wood yea and the gilded velvet of butterfly and the butterfly cheek of young girl all these are but subtile deceit not actually inherent in substance but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely paint like the harlot whose allurement cover nothing but the charnel house within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produce every one of her hue the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all object even tulip and rose with it own blank tinge pondering all this the palsied universe lie before u a leper and like wilful traveller in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glass upon their eye so the wretched infidel gaze himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wrap all the prospect around him and of all these thing the albino whale wa the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery hunt chapter hark hist did you hear that noise cabaco it wa the middle watch a fair moonlight the seaman were standing in a cordon extending from one of the fresh water butt in the waist to the scuttle butt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the bucket to fill the scuttle butt standing for the most part on the hallowed precinct of the quarter deck they were careful not to speak or rustle their foot from hand to hand the bucket went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel it wa in the midst of this repose that archy one of the cordon whose post wa near the after hatch whispered to his neighbor a cholo the word above hist did you hear that noise cabaco take the bucket will ye archy what noise d ye mean there it is again under the hatch don t you hear it a cough it sounded like a cough cough be damned pas along that return bucket there again there it is it sound like two or three sleeper turning over now caramba have done shipmate will ye it s the three soaked biscuit ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye nothing else look to the bucket say what ye will shipmate i ve sharp ear aye you are the chap ain t ye that heard the hum of the old quakeress s knitting needle fifty mile at sea from nantucket you re the chap grin away we ll see what turn up hark ye cabaco there is somebody down in the after hold that ha not yet been seen on deck and i suspect our old mogul know something of it too i heard stubb tell flask one morning watch that there wa something of that sort in the wind tish the bucket chapter the chart had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea chart spread them before him on his screwed down table then seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various line and shading which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional course over space that before were blank at interval he would refer to pile of old log book beside him wherein were set down the season and place in which on various former voyage of various ship sperm whale had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chain over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleam and shadow of line upon his wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himself wa marking out line and course on the wrinkled chart some invisible pencil wa also tracing line and course upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead but it wa not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin ahab thus pondered over his chart almost every night they were brought out almost every night some pencil mark were effaced and others were substituted for with the chart of all four ocean before him ahab wa threading a maze of current and eddy with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the way of the leviathan it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped ocean of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew the set of all tide and current and thereby calculating the drifting of the sperm whale s food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained season for hunting him in particular latitude could arrive at reasonable surmise almost approaching to certainty concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale s resorting to given water that many hunter believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the log for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migration of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring shoal or the flight of swallow on this hint attempt have been made to construct elaborate migratory chart of the sperm whale since the above wa written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april th by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and portion of it are presented in the circular this chart divide the ocean into district of five degree of latitude by five degree of longitude perpendicularly through each of which district are twelve column for the twelve month and horizontally through each of which district are three line one to show the number of day that have been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the number of day in which whale sperm or right have been seen besides when making a passage from one feeding ground to another the sperm whale guided by some infallible instinct say rather secret intelligence from the deity mostly swim in vein a they are called continuing their way along a given ocean line with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these case the direction taken by any one whale be straight a a surveyor s parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confined to it own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these time he is said to swim generally embrace some few mile in width more or less a the vein is presumed to expand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale ship s mast head when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at particular season within that breadth and along that path migrating whale may with great confidence be looked for and hence not only at substantiated time upon well known separate feeding ground could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanse of water between those ground he could by his art so place and time himself on his way a even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting there wa a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality perhaps though the gregarious sperm whale have their regular season for particular ground yet in general you can not conclude that the herd which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instance where the contrary of this ha proved true in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitary and hermit among the matured aged sperm whale so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those spot at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feeding ground where he had at time revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual stopping place and ocean inn so to speak not his place of prolonged abode and where ahab s chance of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion ha only been made to whatever way side antecedent extra prospect were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibility would become probability and a ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase the season on the line for there and then for several consecutive year moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those water for awhile a the sun in it annual round loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac there it wa too that most of the deadly encounter with the white whale had taken place there the wave were storied with his deed there also wa that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hope upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those hope nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart a to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the season on the line no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southward double cape horn and then running down sixty degree of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequod s sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexion of thing because an interval of three hundred and sixty five day and night wa before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in sea far remote from his periodical feeding ground should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china sea or in any other water haunted by his race so that monsoon pampas nor wester harmattan trade any wind but the levanter and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zig zag world circle of the pequod s circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even a a white bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfare of constantinople yes for the peculiar snow white brow of moby dick and his snow white hump could not but be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself a after poring over his chart till long after midnight he would throw himself back in revery tallied him and shall he escape his broad fin are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheep s ear and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trance of torment doe that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleep with clenched hand and wake with his own bloody nail in his palm often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dream of the night which resuming his own intense thought through the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his life spot became insufferable anguish and when a wa sometimes the case these spiritual throe in him heaved his being up from it base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flame and lightning shot up and accursed fiend beckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eye ahab would burst from his state room a though escaping from a bed that wa on fire yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptom of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest token of it intensity for at such time crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock wa not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again the latter wa the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other time employed it for it outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it wa no longer an integral but a the mind doe not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahab s case yielding up all his thought and fancy to his one supreme purpose that purpose by it own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against god and devil into a kind of self assumed independent being of it own nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it wa conjoined fled horror stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eye when what seemed ahab rushed from his room wa for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thought have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus make him a prometheus a vulture feed upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates chapter the affidavit so far a what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed a indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particular in the habit of sperm whale the foregoing chapter in it earlier part is a important a one a will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some mind a to the natural verity of the main point of this affair i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citation of item practically or reliably known to me a a whaleman and from these citation i take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known three instance where a whale after receiving a harpoon ha effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three year ha been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two iron both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where three year intervened between the flinging of the two harpoon and i think it may have been something more than that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two year often endangered by serpent savage tiger poisonous miasma with all the other common peril incident to wandering in the heart of unknown region meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on it travel no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with it flank all the coast of africa but to no purpose this man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have known three instance similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whale struck and upon the second attack saw the two iron with the respective mark cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the three year instance it so fell out that i wa in the boat both time first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale s eye which i had observed there three year previous i say three year but i am pretty sure it wa more than that here are three instance then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many other instance from person whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instance where a particular whale in the ocean ha been at distant time and place popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked wa not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarity a distinguished from other whale for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarity by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil no the reason wa this that from the fatal experience of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale a there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most fisherman were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulin when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devil ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutation to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not only did each of these famous whale enjoy great individual celebrity nay you may call it an ocean wide renown not only wa he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle story after death but he wa admitted into all the right privilege and distinction of a name had a much a name indeed a cambyses or c sar wa it not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long did st lurk in the oriental strait of that name whose spout wa oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay wa it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of all cruiser that crossed their wake in the vicinity of the tattoo land wa it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at time assumed the semblance of a snow white cross against the sky wa it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphic upon the back in plain prose here are four whale a well known to the student of cetacean history a marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various time creating great havoc among the boat of different vessel were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captain who heaved up their anchor with that express object a much in view a in setting out through the narragansett wood captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other thing which to me seem important a in printed form establishing in all respect the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of those disheartening instance where truth requires full a much bolstering a error so ignorant are most landsman of some of the plainest and most palpable wonder of the world that without some hint touching the plain fact historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at moby dick a a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory first though most men have some vague flitting idea of the general peril of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception of those peril and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disaster and death by casualty in the fishery ever find a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whale line off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do you suppose that that poor fellow s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to morrow at your breakfast no because the mail are very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ship every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boat s crew for god s sake be economical with your lamp and candle not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of man s blood wa spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two fold enormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plague of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in some case sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious a with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale ha done it first in the year the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket wa cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spout lowered her boat and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whale ere long several of the whale were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boat issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than ten minute she settled down and fell over not a surviving plank of her ha been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land in their boat being returned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the god shipwrecked him again upon unknown rock and breaker for the second time his ship wa utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he ha never tempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who wa chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few mile of the scene of the catastrophe the following are extract from chace s narrative every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it wa anything but chance which directed his operation he made two several attack upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which according to their direction were calculated to do u the most injury by being made ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two object for the shock to effect which the exact man uvres which he made were necessary his aspect wa most horrible and such a indicated resentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companion a if fired with revenge for their suffering again at all event the whole circumstance taken together all happening before my own eye and producing at the time impression in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impression i can not now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion here are his reflection some time after quitting the ship during a black night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling water were nothing the fear of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rock with all the other ordinary subject of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflection until day again made it appearance in another place p he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal secondly the ship union also of nantucket wa in the year totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic particular of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunter i have now and then heard casual allusion to it thirdly some eighteen or twenty year ago commodore j then commanding an american sloop of war of the first class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captain on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich island conversation turning upon whale the commodore wa pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentleman present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloop of war a to cause her to leak so much a a thimbleful very good but there is more coming some week after the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he wa stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moment confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the commodore s craft such a thwack that with all his pump going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the commodore s interview with that whale a providential wa not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now refer you to langsdorff s voyage for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you must know by the way wa attached to the russian admiral krusenstern s famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begin his seventeenth chapter by the thirteenth of may our ship wa ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather wa very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing for some day we had very little wind it wa not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale the body of which wa larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but wa not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which wa in full sail wa almost upon him so that it wa impossible to prevent it striking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger a this gigantic creature setting up it back raised the ship three foot at least out of the water the mast reeled and the sail fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain d wolf applied immediately to the pump to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured now the captain d wolf here alluded to a commanding the ship in question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventure a a sea captain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however wa by no mean a large one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down manly book of old fashioned adventure so full too of honest wonder the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier s old chum i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff that i can not forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed lionel it seems wa on his way to john ferdinando a he call the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he say about four o clock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty league from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed the shock wa so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement wa a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the suddenness of the shock made the gun leap in their carriage and several of the men were shaken out of their hammock captain davis who lay with his head on a gun wa thrown out of his cabin lionel then go on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock wa after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed with several more example one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at time of the sperm whale in more than one instance he ha been known not only to chase the assailing boat back to their ship but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lance hurled at him from it deck the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and a for his strength let me say that there have been example where the line attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water a a horse walk off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then act not so often with blind rage a with wilful deliberate design of destruction to his pursuer nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minute but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain fact of the present day but that these marvel like all marvel are mere repetition of the age so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon verily there is nothing new under the sun in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the day when justinian wa emperor and belisarius general a many know he wrote the history of his own time a work every way of uncommon value by the best authority he ha always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particular not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned now in this history of his procopius mention that during the term of his prefecture at constantinople a great sea monster wa captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed vessel at interval in those water for a period of more than fifty year a fact thus set down in substantial history can not easily be gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise specie this sea monster wa is not mentioned but a he destroyed ship a well a for other reason he must have been a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep water connecting with it even now i am certain that those sea are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of thing a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigation have recently proved to me that in modern time there have been isolated instance of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale now a a vessel of war readily pass through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pas out of the mediterranean into the propontis in the propontis a far a i can learn none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale squid or cuttle fish lurks at the bottom of that sea because large creature but by no mean the largest of that sort have been found at it surface if then you properly put these statement together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning procopius s sea monster that for half a century stove the ship of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale chapter surmise though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his thought and action ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interest to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he wa by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s way altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motif much more influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whale and that the more monster he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chance that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were still additional consideration which though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no mean incapable of swaying him to accomplish his object ahab must use tool and of all tool used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respect wa over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation starbuck s body and starbuck s coerced will were ahab s so long a ahab kept his magnet at starbuck s brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captain s quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale wa seen during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapse of rebellion against his captain s leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influence were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick wa noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few men s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watch his officer and men must have some nearer thing to think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailor of all sort are more or less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outer weather and they inhale it fickleness and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all thing requisite that temporary interest and employment should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash nor wa ahab unmindful of another thing in time of strong emotion mankind disdain all base consideration but such time are evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the heart of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breed a certain generous knight errantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetite for even the high lifted and chivalric crusader of old time were not content to traverse two thousand mile of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglary picking pocket and gaining other pious perquisite by the way had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object that final and romantic object too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all hope of cash aye cash they may scorn cash now but let some month go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor wa there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod s voyage ahab wa now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequence of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it wa possible for his crew to be subjected to for all these reason then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod s voyage observe all customary usage and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession be all this a it may his voice wa now often heard hailing the three mast head and admonishing them to keep a bright look out and not omit reporting even a porpoise this vigilance wa not long without reward chapter the mat maker it wa a cloudy sultry afternoon the seaman were lazily lounging about the deck or vacantly gazing over into the lead coloured water queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword mat for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding wa all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self i wa the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat a i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarn of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and a queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the thread and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed a if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fate there lay the fixed thread of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other thread with it own this warp seemed necessity and here thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable thread meantime queequeg s impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly a the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savage s sword thought i which thus finally shape and fashion both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance aye chance free will and necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly working together the straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from it ultimate course it every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given thread and chance though restrained in it play within the right line of necessity and sideways in it motion directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turn rule either and ha the last featuring blow at event thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the cloud whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the cross tree wa that mad gay header tashtego his body wa reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden interval he continued his cry to be sure the same sound wa that very moment perhaps being heard all over the sea from hundred of whalemen s look out perched a high in the air but from few of those lung could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence a from tashtego the indian s a he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadow of fate and by those wild cry announcing their coming there she blow there there there she blow she blow where away on the lee beam about two mile off a school of them instantly all wa commotion the sperm whale blow a a clock tick with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribe of his genus there go fluke wa now the cry from tashtego and the whale disappeared quick steward cried ahab time time dough boy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to ahab the ship wa now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whale had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bow for that singular craft at time evinced by the sperm whale when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mill round and swiftly swim off in the opposite quarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action for there wa no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of the men selected for shipkeepers that is those not appointed to the boat by this time relieved the indian at the main mast head the sailor at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tub were fixed in their place the crane were thrust out the mainyard wa backed and the three boat swung over the sea like three samphire basket over high cliff outside of the bulwark their eager crew with one hand clung to the rail while one foot wa expectantly poised on the gunwale so look the long line of man of war s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy s ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation wa heard that took every eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who wa surrounded by five dusky phantom that seemed fresh formed out of air chapter the first lowering the phantom for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackle and band of the boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boat though technically called the captain s on account of it hanging from the starboard quarter the figure that now stood by it bow wa tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from it steel like lip a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness wa a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companion of this figure were of that vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal native of the manilla a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariner supposed to be the paid spy and secret confidential agent on the water of the devil their lord whose counting room they suppose to be elsewhere while yet the wondering ship s company were gazing upon these stranger ahab cried out to the white turbaned old man at their head all ready there fedallah ready wa the half hissed reply lower away then d ye hear shouting across the deck lower away there i say such wa the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaf whirled round in the block with a wallow the three boat dropped into the sea while with a dexterous off handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailor goat like leaped down the rolling ship s side into the tossed boat below hardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five stranger rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so a to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eye again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmate of the other boat obeyed not the command captain ahab said starbuck spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boat thou flask pull out more to leeward aye aye sir cheerily cried little king post sweeping round his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew there there there again there she blow right ahead boy lay back never heed yonder yellow boy archy oh i don t mind em sir said archy i knew it all before now didn t i hear em in the hold and didn t i tell cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaway mr flask pull pull my fine heart alive pull my child pull my little one drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom still showed sign of uneasiness why don t you break your backbone my boy what is it you stare at those chap in yonder boat tut they are only five more hand come to help u never mind from where the more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstone devil are good fellow enough so so there you are now that s the stroke for a thousand pound that s the stroke to sweep the stake hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my hero three cheer men all heart alive easy easy don t be in a hurry don t be in a hurry why don t you snap your oar you rascal bite something you dog so so so then softly softly that s it that s it long and strong give way there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallion ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleeper and pull pull will ye pull can t ye pull won t ye why in the name of gudgeon and ginger cake don t ye pull pull and break something pull and start your eye out here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mother s son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth that s it that s it now ye do something that look like it my steel bit start her start her my silver spoon start her marling spike stubb s exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passion with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would say the most terrific thing to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely a a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocation without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly gaped open mouthed at time that the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew then again stubb wa one of those odd sort of humorist whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous a to put all inferior on their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck wa now pulling obliquely across stubb s bow and when for a minute or so the two boat were pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inch a he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from stubb s what think ye of those yellow boy sir smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong boy in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lad but never mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what will spring my men spring there s hogshead of sperm ahead mr stubb and that s what ye came for pull my boy sperm sperm s the play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand aye aye i thought a much soliloquized stubb when the boat diverged a soon a i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and that s what he went into the after hold for so often a dough boy long suspected they were hidden down there the white whale s at the bottom of it well well so be it can t be helped all right give way men it ain t the white whale to day give way now the advent of these outlandish stranger at such a critical instant a the lowering of the boat from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship s company but archy s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and stubb s confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjecture a to dark ahab s precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious shadow i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn a well a the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah meantime ahab out of hearing of his officer having sided the furthest to windward wa still ranging ahead of the other boat a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew wa pulling him those tiger yellow creature of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five trip hammer they rose and fell with regular stroke of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer a for fedallah who wa seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depression of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencer s thrown half backward into the air a if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab wa seen steadily managing his steering oar a in a thousand boat lowering ere the white whale had torn him all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boat s five oar were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boat in the rear paused on their way the whale had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it every man look out along his oar cried starbuck thou queequeg stand up nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eye gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it wa also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself wa seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea not very far distant flask s boat wa also lying breathlessly still it commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two foot above the level of the stern platform it is used for catching turn with the whale line it top is not more spacious than the palm of a man s hand and standing upon such a base a that flask seemed perched at the mast head of some ship which had sunk to all but her truck but little king post wa small and short and at the same time little king post wa full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand point of his did by no mean satisfy king post i can t see three sea off tip u up an oar there and let me on to that upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulder for a pedestal good a mast head a any sir will you mount that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you fifty foot taller whereupon planting his foot firmly against two opposite plank of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to flask s foot and then putting flask s hand on his hearse plumed head and bidding him spring a he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulder and here wa flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross running sea still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstance but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo wa yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen haired flask seemed a snow flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro s lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tide and her season for that meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far gazing solicitude the whale might have made one of their regular sounding not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case stubb a his wont in such case it seems wa resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumb end but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eye had been setting to windward like two fixed star suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat cry out in a quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give way there they are to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puff of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billow the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled a it were like the air over intensely heated plate of iron beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whale were swimming seen in advance of all the other indication the puff of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning courier and detached flying outrider all four boat were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on a a mass of interblending bubble borne down a rapid stream from the hill pull pull my good boy said starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eye darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed a two visible needle in two unerring binnacle compass he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the silence of the boat wa at interval startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whisper now harsh with command now soft with entreaty how different the loud little king post sing out and say something my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolt beach me beach me on their black back boy only do that for me and i ll sign over to you my martha s vineyard plantation boy including wife and child boy lay me on lay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed after he s got fit that flask ha fit yes give him fit that s the very word pitch fit into em merrily merrily heart alive pudding for supper you know merry s the word pull babe pull suckling pull all but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbone and bite your knife in two that s all take it easy why don t ye take it easy i say and burst all your liver and lung but what it wa that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger yellow crew of his these were word best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel shark in the audacious sea may give ear to such word when with tornado brow and eye of red murder and foam glued lip ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile all the boat tore on the repeated specific allusion of flask to that whale a he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat s bow with it tail these allusion of his were at time so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this wa against all rule for the oarsman must put out their eye and ram a skewer through their neck usage pronouncing that they must have no organ but ear and no limb but arm in these critical moment it wa a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swell of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made a they rolled along the eight gunwale like gigantic bowl in a boundless bowling green the brief suspended agony of the boat a it would tip for an instant on the knife like edge of the sharper wave that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glen and hollow the keen spurring and goading to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sled like slide down it other side all these with the cry of the headsman and harpooneer and the shuddering gasp of the oarsman with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boat with outstretched sail like a wild hen after her screaming brood all this wa thrilling not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead man s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotion than that man doe who for the first time find himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase wa now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadow flung upon the sea the jet of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whale seemed separating their wake the boat were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whale running dead to leeward our sail wa now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oar could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row lock soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be seen give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall come there s white water again close to spring soon after two cry in quick succession on each side of u denoted that the other boat had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightning like hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his foot though not one of the oarsman wa then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eye on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound a of fifty elephant stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat wa still booming through the mist the wave curling and hissing around u like the erected crest of enraged serpent that s his hump there there give it to him whispered starbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it wa the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath u the whole crew were half suffocated a they were tossed helter skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped though completely swamped the boat wa nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the floating oar and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our place there we sat up to our knee in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eye the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to u from the bottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl the wave dashed their buckler together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around u like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaw of death in vain we hailed the other boat a well roar to the live coal down the chimney of a flaming furnace a hail those boat in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadow of night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempt to bale out the boat the oar were useless a propeller performing now the office of life preserver so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failure starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg a the standard bearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eye a the dawn came on the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his foot hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking a of rope and yard hitherto muffled by the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mist were dimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea a the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon u within a distance of not much more than it length floating on the wave we saw the abandoned boat a for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship s bow like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it wa seen no more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the sea and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall came close to the other boat had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given u up but wa still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing an oar or a lance pole chapter the hyena there are certain queer time and occasion in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man take this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspect that the joke is at nobody s expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolt down all event all creed and belief and persuasion all hard thing visible and invisible never mind how knobby a an ostrich of potent digestion gobble down bullet and gun flint and a for small difficulty and worrying prospect of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly good natured hit and jolly punch in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of come over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it come in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like the peril of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale it object queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and i wa still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water queequeg my fine friend doe this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such thing did often happen mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oil jacket wa now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman s discretion certain i ve lowered for whale from a leaking ship in a gale off cape horn mr flask said i turning to little king post who wa standing close by you are experienced in these thing and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back foremost into death s jaw can t you twist that smaller said flask yes that s the law i should like to see a boat s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that here then from three impartial witness i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squall and capsizing in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matter of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hand of him who steered the boat oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat wa chiefly to be imputed to starbuck s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding wa famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbuck s boat and finally considering in what a devil s chase i wa implicated touching the white whale taking all thing together i say i thought i might a well go below and make a rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee it may seem strange that of all men sailor should be tinkering at their last will and testament but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion this wa the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing after the ceremony wa concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone wa rolled away from my heart besides all the day i should now live would be a good a the day that lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many month or week a the case might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bar of a snug family vault now then thought i unconsciously rolling up the sleeve of my frock here go for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost chapter ahab s boat and crew fedallah who would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug hole with my timber toe oh he s a wonderful old man i don t think it so strange after all on that account said flask if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing that would disable him but he ha one knee and good part of the other left you know i don t know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel among whale wise people it ha often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active peril of the chase so tamerlane s soldier often argued with tear in their eye whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering that with two leg man is but a hobbling wight in all time of danger considering that the pursuit of whale is always under great and extraordinary difficulty that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstance is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale boat in the hunt a a general thing the joint owner of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although his friend at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitude of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his order in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him a a regular headsman in the hunt above all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men a that same boat s crew he well knew that such generous conceit never entered the head of the owner of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boat s crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desire on that head nevertheless he had taken private measure of his own touching all that matter until cabaco s published discovery the sailor had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hand had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboat for service when some time after this ahab wa now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole pin with his own hand for what wa thought to be one of the spare boat and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewer which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this wa observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat a if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat a it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boat s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it wa observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these thing i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no mean involve the remotest suspicion a to any boat s crew being assigned to that boat now with the subordinate phantom what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonder soon wane besides now and then such unaccountable odds and end of strange nation come up from the unknown nook and ash hole of the earth to man these floating outlaw of whaler and the ship themselves often pick up such queer castaway creature found tossing about the open sea on plank bit of wreck oar whaleboat canoe blown off japanese junk and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle but be all this a it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantom soon found their place among the crew though still a it were somehow distinct from them yet that hair turbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahab s peculiar fortune nay so far a to have some sort of a half hinted influence heaven know but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew but one can not sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah he wa such a creature a civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dream and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic community especially the oriental isle to the east of the continent those insulated immemorial unalterable country which even in these modern day still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth s primal generation when the memory of the first man wa a distinct recollection and all men his descendant unknowing whence he came eyed each other a real phantom and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to genesis the angel indeed consorted with the daughter of men the devil also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amour chapter the spirit spout day week passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising ground that off the azores off the cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it wa while gliding through these latter water that one serene and moonlight night when all the wave rolled by like scroll of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet wa seen far in advance of the white bubble at the bow lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight night it wa his wont to mount to the main mast head and stand a look out there with the same precision a if it had been day and yet though herd of whale were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotion then the seaman beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hour his turban and the moon companion in one sky but when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive night without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice wa heard announcing that silvery moon lit jet every reclining mariner started to his foot a if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blow had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it wa a most unwonted hour yet so impressive wa the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering walking the deck with quick side lunging stride ahab commanded the t gallant sail and royal to be set and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then with every mast head manned the piled up craft rolled down before the wind the strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollow of so many sail made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the foot while still she rushed along a if two antagonistic influence were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched ahab s face that night you would have thought that in him also two different thing were warring while his one live leg made lively echo along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin tap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrow the eager glance shot yet the silvery jet wa no more seen that night every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time this midnight spout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some day after lo at the same silent hour it wa again announced again it wa descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared a if it had never been and so it served u night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight a the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two day or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring u on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness a it seemed which in many thing invested the pequod were there wanting some of the seaman who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote time or in however far apart latitude and longitude that unnearable spout wa cast by one self same whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition a if it were treacherously beckoning u on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon u and rend u at last in the remotest and most savage sea these temporary apprehension so vague but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all it blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm a for day and day we voyaged along through sea so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urn like prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape wind began howling around u and we rose and fell upon the long troubled sea that are there when the ivory tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark wave in her madness till like shower of silver chip the foam flake flew over her bulwark then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sight more dismal than before close to our bow strange form in the water darted hither and thither before u while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea raven and every morning perched on our stay row of these bird were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp a though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roosting place for their homeless self and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea a if it vast tide were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoso a called of yore for long allured by the perfidious silence that before had attended u we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where guilty being transformed into those fowl and these fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon but calm snow white and unvarying still directing it fountain of feather to the sky still beckoning u on from before the solitary jet would at time be descried during all this blackness of the element ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mate in tempestuous time like these after everything above and aloft ha been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalist so with his ivory leg inserted into it accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hour and hour would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelash together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous sea that burstingly broke over it bow stood in a line along the bulwark in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping wave each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung a in a loosened belt few or no word were spoken and the silent ship a if manned by painted sailor in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac wave by night the same muteness of humanity before the shriek of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowline still wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old man s aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eye sitting straight in his floor screwed chair the rain and half melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those chart of tide and current which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the body wa erect the head wa thrown back so that the closed eye were pointed towards the needle of the tell tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling the cabin compass is called the tell tale because without going to the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course of the ship terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter the albatross south eastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross by name a she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the fore mast head i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fishery a whaler at sea and long absent from home a if the wave had been fuller this craft wa bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her side this spectral appearance wa traced with long channel of reddened rust while all her spar and her rigging were like the thick branch of tree furred over with hoar frost only her lower sail were set a wild sight it wa to see her long bearded look out at those three mast head they seemed clad in the skin of beast so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four year of cruising standing in iron hoop nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast head of one ship to those of the other yet those forlorn looking fisherman mildly eyeing u a they passed said not one word to our own look out while the quarter deck hail wa being heard from below ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale but a the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwark wa in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship wa still increasing the distance between while in various silent way the seaman of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whale s name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed a though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel wa a nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailed ahoy there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letter to the pacific ocean and this time three year if i am not at home tell them to address them to at that moment the two wake were fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular way shoal of small harmless fish that for some day before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fin and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger s flank though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifle capriciously carry meaning swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the word but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voice up helm keep her off round the world round the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feeling but whereto doe all that circumnavigation conduct only through numberless peril to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before u were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distance and discover sight more sweet and strange than any cyclades or island of king solomon then there were promise in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mystery we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swim before all human heart while chasing such over this round globe they either lead u on in barren maze or midway leave u whelmed chapter the gam the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken wa this the wind and sea betokened storm but even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded her judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasion if so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put for a it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five minute with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usage of whaling vessel when meeting each other in foreign sea and especially on a common cruising ground if two stranger crossing the pine barren in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wild these twain for the life of them can not well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barren and salisbury plain of the sea two whaling vessel descrying each other at the end of the earth off lone fanning s island or the far away king s mill how much more natural i say that under such circumstance these ship should not only interchange hail but come into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessel owned in one seaport and whose captain officer and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sort of dear domestic thing to talk about for the long absent ship the outward bounder perhaps ha letter on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some paper of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb worn file and in return for that courtesy the outward bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessel crossing each other s track on the cruising ground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a transfer of letter from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letter may be for the people of the ship she now meet besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathy of sailor but likewise with all the peculiar congeniality arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privation and peril nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long a both party speak one language a is the case with american and english though to be sure from the small number of english whaler such meeting do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he doe not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whaler sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whaler regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript provincialism a a sort of sea peasant but where this superiority in the english whalemen doe really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankee in one day collectively kill more whale than all the english collectively in ten year but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale hunter which the nantucketer doe not take much to heart probably because he know that he ha a few foible himself so then we see that of all ship separately sailing the sea the whaler have most reason to be sociable and they are so whereas some merchant ship crossing each other s wake in the mid atlantic will oftentimes pas on without so much a a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high sea like a brace of dandy in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each other s rig a for men of war when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of silly bowing and scraping such a ducking of ensign that there doe not seem to be much right down hearty good will and brotherly love about it at all a touching slave ship meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other a soon a possible and a for pirate when they chance to cross each other s cross bone the first hail is how many skull the same way that whaler hail how many barrel and that question once answered pirate straightway steer apart for they are infernal villain on both side and don t like to see overmuch of each other s villanous likeness but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable free and easy whaler what doe the whaler do when she meet another whaler in any sort of decent weather she ha a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ship that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouter and blubber boiler and such like pretty exclamation why it is that all merchant seaman and also all pirate and man of war s men and slave ship sailor cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale ship this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of pirate say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs ha any peculiar glory about it it sometimes end in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he ha no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate ha no solid basis to stand on but what is a gam you might wear out your index finger running up and down the column of dictionary and never find the word dr johnson never attained to that erudition noah webster s ark doe not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word ha now for many year been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankee certainly it need a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view let me learnedly define it gam noun a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a cruising ground when after exchanging hail they exchange visit by boat crew the two captain remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mate on the other there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here all profession have their own little peculiarity of detail so ha the whale fishery in a pirate man of war or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheet on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steer himself with a pretty little milliner s tiller decorated with gay cord and ribbon but the whale boat ha no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all high time indeed if whaling captain were wheeled about the water on castor like gouty old alderman in patent chair and a for a tiller the whale boat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore a in gamming a complete boat s crew must leave the ship and hence a the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eye of the whole visible world resting on him from the side of the two ship this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his leg nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the after oar reciprocating by rapping his knee in front he is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched leg but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of two pole and you can not stand them up then again it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted eye it would never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hand indeed a token of his entire buoyant self command he generally carry his hand in his trowsers pocket but perhaps being generally very large heavy hand he carry them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instance well authenticated one too where the captain ha been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the nearest oarsman s hair and hold on there like grim death chapter the town ho s story a told at the golden inn the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corner of a great highway where you meet more traveller than in any other part it wa not very long after speaking the goney that another homeward bound whaleman the town ho wa encountered she wa manned almost wholly by polynesian in the short gam that ensued she gave u strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white whale wa now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town ho s story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgment of god which at time are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance with it own particular accompaniment forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ear of captain ahab or his mate for that secret part of the story wa unknown to the captain of the town ho himself it wa the private property of three confederate white seaman of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunction of secrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he wa wakened he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seaman in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod s main mast interweaving in it proper place this darker thread with the story a publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record the ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin for my humor s sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friend one saint s eve smoking upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavalier the young don pedro and sebastian were on the closer term with me and hence the interluding question they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time some two year prior to my first learning the event which i am about rehearsing to you gentleman the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket wa cruising in your pacific here not very many day sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she wa somewhere to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pump according to daily usage it wa observed that she made more water in her hold than common they supposed a sword fish had stabbed her gentleman but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitude and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold a low down a wa possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariner working at the pump at wide and easy interval but no good luck came more day went by and not only wa the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the island there to have his hull hove out and repaired though no small passage wa before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pump were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those six and thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breeze the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo lakeman buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass on the eastern shore of our lake erie don but i crave your courtesy may be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentleman in square sail brig and three masted ship well nigh a large and stout a any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land locked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impression popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh water sea of ours erie and ontario and huron and superior and michigan possess an ocean like expansiveness with many of the ocean s noblest trait with many of it rimmed variety of race and of clime they contain round archipelago of romantic isle even a the polynesian water do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nation a the atlantic is they furnish long maritime approach to our numerous territorial colony from the east dotted all round their bank here and there are frowned upon by battery and by the goat like craggy gun of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victory at interval they yield their beach to wild barbarian whose red painted face flash from out their peltry wigwam for league and league are flanked by ancient and unentered forest where the gaunt pine stand like serried line of king in gothic genealogy those same wood harboring wild afric beast of prey and silken creature whose exported fur give robe to tartar emperor they mirror the paved capital of buffalo and cleveland a well a winnebago village they float alike the full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blast a direful a any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwreck are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all it shrieking crew thus gentleman though an inlander steelkilt wa wild ocean born and wild ocean nurtured a much of an audacious mariner a any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet wa he quite a vengeful and full of social quarrel a the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitude of buck horn handled bowie knife yet wa this nantucketer a man with some good hearted trait and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave s right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all event he had proved so thus far but radney wa doomed and made mad and steelkilt but gentleman you shall hear it wa not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the town ho s leak seemed again increasing but only so a to require an hour or more at the pump every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skipper think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be that he and his shipmate would never again remember it on account of all hand gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage sea far from you to the westward gentleman is it altogether unusual for ship to keep clanging at their pump handle in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those water some really landless latitude that her captain begin to feel a little anxious much this way had it been with the town ho so when her leak wa found gaining once more there wa in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sail to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose wa a little of a coward and a little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person a any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentleman therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seaman declared that it wa only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pump there wa on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them a they stood with their foot continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear a any mountain spring gentleman that bubbling from the pump ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spout at the lee scupper hole now a you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours watery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellow men find one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern s tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine a it may gentleman at all event steelkilt wa a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housing of your last viceroy s snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentleman which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagne s father but radney the mate wa ugly a a mule yet a hardy a stubborn a malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it espying the mate drawing near a he wa toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings aye aye my merry lad it s a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and let s have a taste by the lord it s worth bottling i tell ye what men old rad s investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boy that sword fish only began the job he s come back again with a gang of ship carpenter saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvement i suppose if old rad were here now i d tell him to jump overboard and scatter em they re playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but he s a simple old soul rad and a beauty too boy they say the rest of his property is invested in looking glass i wonder if he d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose damn your eye what s that pump stopping for roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailor talk thunder away at it aye aye sir said steelkilt merry a a cricket lively boy lively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engine the men tossed their hat off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lung wa heard which denotes the fullest tension of life s utmost energy quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eye bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now what cozening fiend it wa gentleman that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the plank and also a shovel and remove some offensive matter consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large now gentleman sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all time but raging gale is regularly attended to every evening it ha been known to be done in the case of ship actually foundering at the time such gentleman is the inflexibility of sea usage and the instinctive love of neatness in seaman some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their face but in all vessel this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boy if boy there be aboard besides it wa the stronger men in the town ho that had been divided into gang taking turn at the pump and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gang consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duty such being the case with his comrade i mention all these particular so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men but there wa more than this the order about the shovel wa almost a plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt a though radney had spat in his face any man who ha gone sailor in a whale ship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but a he sat still for a moment and a he steadfastly looked into the mate s malignant eye and perceived the stack of powder cask heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them a he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being a repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling gentleman stole over steelkilt therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he wa temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck wa not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lad a the customary sweeper who not being billeted at the pump had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted cooper s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by heated and irritated a he wa by his spasmodic toil at the pump for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inch of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it wa to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne a much a comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatch and thus spoke to the officer mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable malediction retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentleman the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the god immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate wa stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale ere the cry could go aft steelkilt wa shaking one of the backstay leading far aloft to where two of his comrade were standing their masthead they were both canallers canallers cried don pedro we have seen many whale ship in our harbour but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they canallers don are the boatman belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of it nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous north aye well then don refill my cup your chicha s very fine and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may throw side light upon my story for three hundred and sixty mile gentleman through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous city and most thriving village through long dismal uninhabited swamp and affluent cultivated field unrivalled for fertility by billiard room and bar room through the holy of holy of great forest on roman arch over indian river through sun and shade by happy heart or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk county and especially by row of snow white chapel whose spire stand almost like milestone flow one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life there s your true ashantee gentleman there howl your pagan where you ever find them next door to you under the long flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of church for by some curious fatality a it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooter that they ever encamp around the hall of justice so sinner gentleman most abound in holiest vicinity is that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern well for our northern friend dame isabella s inquisition wane in lima laughed don sebastian proceed senor a moment pardon cried another of the company in the name of all u limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no mean overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this coast corrupt a lima it but bear out your saying too church more plentiful than billiard table and for ever open and corrupt a lima so too venice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st mark st dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you pour out again freely depicted in his own vocation gentleman the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for day and day along his green turfed flowery nile he indolently float openly toying with his red cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sport his slouched and gaily ribboned hat betoken his grand feature a terror to the smiling innocence of the village through which he float his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in city once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turn from one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming quality of your man of violence that at time he ha a stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait a to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentleman what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains so many of it most finished graduate and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captain nor doe it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousand of our rural boy and young men born along it line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn field and recklessly ploughing the water of the most barbaric sea i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffle no need to travel the world s one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north the generation were cold and holy a the hill but the story i left off gentleman where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he wa surrounded by the three junior mate and the four harpooneer who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the rope like baleful comet the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailor joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harm s way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale pike calling upon his officer to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarter deck at interval he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperado were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large cask in a line with the windlass these sea parisian entrenched themselves behind the barricade come out of that ye pirate roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come out of that ye cut throat steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistol could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his steelkilt s death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hand fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgent instantly to return to their duty will you promise not to touch u if we do demanded their ringleader turn to turn to i make no promise to your duty do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he once more raised a pistol sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of u turn to unless you swear not to raise a rope yarn against u what say ye men turning to his comrade a fierce cheer wa their response the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentence a these it s not our fault we didn t want it i told him to take his hammer away it wa boy s business he might have known me before this i told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ain t those mincing knife down in the forecastle there men look to those handspike my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word don t be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat u decently and we re your men but we won t be flogged turn to i make no promise turn to i say look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him there are a few of u here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise d ye see now a you well know sir we can claim our discharge a soon a the anchor is down so we don t want a row it s not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we won t be flogged turn to roared the captain steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then said i tell you what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we won t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack u but till you say the word about not flogging u we don t do a hand s turn down into the forecastle then down with ye i ll keep ye there till ye re sick of it down ye go shall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bear into a cave a the lakeman s bare head wa just level with the plank the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hand upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon them ten in number leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral all night a wide awake watch wa kept by all the officer forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it wa feared the insurgent might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hour of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pump whose clinking and clanking at interval through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoner to work but with a yell they refused water wa then lowered down to them and a couple of handful of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter deck twice every day for three day this wa repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling wa heard a the customary summons wa delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fear of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineer bolted up into the air from the desperate arm below that sought to restrain them only three were left better turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer shut u up again will ye cried steelkilt oh certainly said the captain and the key clicked it wa at this point gentleman that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associate and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place a black a the bowel of despair it wa then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knife long crescentic heavy implement with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not that wa the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what wa more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader a fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly a his two comrade would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentleman the foul play of these miscreant must come out upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treachery together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their soul to each other in three sentence and bound the sleeper with cord and gagged him with cord and shrieked out for the captain at midnight thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mate and harpooneer rushed for the forecastle in a few minute the scuttle wa opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader wa shoved up into the air by his perfidious ally who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarter of meat and there they hung till morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them the vulture would not touch ye ye villain at sunrise he summoned all hand and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought upon the whole he would do so he ought to justice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular but a for you ye carrion rogue turning to the three men in the rigging for you i mean to mince ye up for the try pot and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the back of the two traitor till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their head sideways a the two crucified thief are drawn my wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldn t give up take that gag from his mouth and let u hear what he can say for himself for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaw and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss what i say is this and mind it well if you flog me i murder you say ye so then see how ye frighten me and the captain drew off with the rope to strike best not hissed the lakeman but i must and the rope wa once more drawn back for the stroke steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hand started back paced the deck rapidly two or three time and then suddenly throwing down his rope said i won t do it let him go cut him down d ye hear but a the junior mate were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested them radney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene such wa the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe you are a coward hissed the lakeman so i am but take that the mate wa in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilt s threat whatever that might have been the three men were then cut down all hand were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seaman the iron pump clanged a before just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor wa heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitor running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaty cuff and kick could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ship s run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilt s instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all order to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thing namely not to sing out for whale in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other peril the town ho still maintained her mast head and her captain wa just a willing to lower for a fish that moment a on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate wa quite a ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale but though the lakeman had induced the seaman to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all wa over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricle of his heart he wa in radney the chief mate s watch and a if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstance steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwark of the quarter deck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which wa hoisted up there a little above the ship s side in this attitude it wa well known he sometimes dozed there wa a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this wa the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o clock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watch below what are you making there said a shipmate what do you think what doe it look like like a lanyard for your bag but it s an odd one seems to me yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arm s length before him but i think it will answer shipmate i haven t enough twine have you any but there wa none in the forecastle then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft you don t mean to go a begging to him said a sailor why not do you think he won t do me a turn when it s to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it wa given him neither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman s monkey jacket a he wa tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twenty four hour after his trick at the silent helm nigh to the man who wa apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour wa then to come and in the fore ordaining soul of steelkilt the mate wa already stark and stretched a a corpse with his forehead crushed in but gentleman a fool saved the would be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hand into it own the damning thing he would have done it wa just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the deck that a stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the main chain all at once shouted out there she roll there she roll jesu what a whale it wa moby dick moby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do whale have christening whom call you moby dick a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don but that would be too long a story how how cried all the young spaniard crowding nay don don nay nay i can not rehearse that now let me get more into the air sir the chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend look faint fill up his empty glass no need gentleman one moment and i proceed now gentleman so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yard of the ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast head all wa now a phrensy the white whale the white whale wa the cry from captain mate and harpooneer who undeterred by fearful rumour were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curse the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentleman a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these event a if verily mapped out before the world itself wa charted the mutineer wa the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it wa his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boat were lowered the mate s got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt a he strained at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he wa always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his bandaged cry wa to beach him on the whale s topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whiteness together till of a sudden the boat struck a against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant a he fell on the whale s slippery back the boat righted and wa dashed aside by the swell while radney wa tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant wa dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaw and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down meantime at the first tap of the boat s bottom the lakeman had slackened the line so a to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thought but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale wa free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatter of radney s red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boat gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared in good time the town ho reached her port a savage solitary place where no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palm eventually a it turned out seizing a large double war canoe of the savage and setting sail for some other harbor the ship s company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islander to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous ally wa this small band of white necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme wa the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officer he anchored the ship a far off shore a possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bow stacked his musket on the poop and warning the islander not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred mile distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe wa descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of coral he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked war canoe the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much a clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubble and foam what do you want of me cried the captain where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt no lie i am bound to tahiti for more men very good let me board you a moment i come in peace with that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain cross your arm sir throw back your head now repeat after me a soon a steelkilt leaf me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six day if i do not may lightning strike me a pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrade watching the boat till it wa fairly beached and drawn up to the root of the cocoa nut tree steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended him two ship were about to sail for france and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution some ten day after the french ship sailed the whale boat arrived and the captain wa forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitian who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings where steelkilt now is gentleman none know but upon the island of nantucket the widow of radney still turn to the sea which refuse to give up it dead still in dream see the awful white whale that destroyed him are you through said don sebastian quietly i am don then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own conviction this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to press also bear with all of u sir sailor for we all join in don sebastian s suit cried the company with exceeding interest is there a copy of the holy evangelist in the golden inn gentleman nay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised this may grow too serious will you be so good a to bring the priest also don though there are no auto da f s in lima now said one of the company to another i fear our sailor friend run risk of the archiepiscopacy let u withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need of this excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelist you can this is the priest he brings you the evangelist said don sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it so help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye gentleman is in substance and it great item true i know it to be true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney chapter of the monstrous picture of whale i shall ere long paint to you a well a one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale a he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portrait of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such picture of the whale all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusion will be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculpture for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous time when on the marble panelling of temple the pedestal of statue and on shield medallion cup and coin the dolphin wa drawn in scale of chain armor like saladin s and a helmeted head like st george s ever since then ha something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular picture of the whale but in many scientific presentation of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale s is to be found in the famous cavern pagoda of elephanta in india the brahmin maintain that in the almost endless sculpture of that immemorial pagoda all the trade and pursuit every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured age before any of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known a the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so a only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong it look more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palm of the true whale s majestic fluke but go to the old gallery and look now at a great christian painter s portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is guido s picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the sea monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange creature a that nor doe hogarth in painting the same scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it ha a sort of howdah on it back and it distended tusked mouth into which the billow are rolling might be taken for the traitor gate leading from the thames by water into the tower then there are the prodromus whale of old scotch sibbald and jonah s whale a depicted in the print of old bible and the cut of old primer what shall be said of these a for the book binder s whale winding like a vine stalk round the stock of a descending anchor a stamped and gilded on the back and title page of many book both old and new that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figure on antique vas though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this book binder s fish an attempt at a whale because it wa so intended when the device wa first introduced it wa introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the th century during the revival of learning and in those day and even down to a comparatively late period dolphin were popularly supposed to be a specie of the leviathan in the vignette and other embellishment of some ancient book you will at time meet with very curious touch at the whale where all manner of spout jet d eau hot spring and cold saratoga and baden baden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the title page of the original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some curious whale but quitting all these unprofessional attempt let u glance at those picture of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineation by those who know in old harris s collection of voyage there are some plate of whale extracted from a dutch book of voyage a d entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plate the whale like great raft of log are represented lying among ice isle with white bear running over their living back in another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular fluke then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn into the south sea for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fishery in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marine to mention but one thing about it let me say that it ha an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow window some five foot long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give u jonah looking out of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilation of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake look at that popular work goldsmith s animated nature in the abridged london edition of there are plate of an alleged whale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale look much like an amputated sow and a for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboy then again in bernard germain count de lac p de a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several picture of the different specie of the leviathan all these are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man a touching that specie declares not to have it counterpart in nature but the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blundering business wa reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron in he published a natural history of whale in which he give what he call a picture of the sperm whale before showing that picture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier s sperm whale is not a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell perhaps he got it a his scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortion that is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lad with the pencil those chinese are many queer cup and saucer inform u a for the sign painter whale seen in the street hanging over the shop of oil dealer what shall be said of them they are generally richard iii whale with dromedary hump and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tart that is whaleboat full of mariner their deformity floundering in sea of blood and blue paint but these manifold mistake in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawing have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about a correct a a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all it undashed pride of hull and spar though elephant have stood for their full length the living leviathan ha never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable water and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched line of battle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so a to preserve all his mighty swell and undulation and not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full grown platonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whale hoisted to a ship s deck such is then the outlandish eel like limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hint may be derived touching his true form not at all for it is one of the more curious thing about this leviathan that his skeleton give very little idea of his general shape though jeremy bentham s skeleton which hang for candelabra in the library of one of his executor correctly conveys the idea of a burly browed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremy s other leading personal characteristic yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan s articulated bone in fact a the great hunter say the mere skeleton of the whale bear the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal a the insect doe to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelope it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head a in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin the bone of which almost exactly answer to the bone of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin ha four regular bone finger the index middle ring and little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering a the human finger in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve u said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle u without mitten for all these reason then any way you may look at it you must need conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really look like and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan chapter of the less erroneous picture of whale and the true picture of whaling scene in connexion with the monstrous picture of whale i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous story of them which are to be found in certain book both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pas that matter by i know of only four published outline of the great sperm whale colnett s huggins s frederick cuvier s and beale s in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to huggins s is far better than theirs but by great odds beale s is the best all beale s drawing of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whale in various attitude capping his second chapter his frontispiece boat attacking sperm whale though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and life like in it general effect some of the sperm whale drawing in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though of the right whale the best outline picture are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he ha but one picture of whaling scene and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such picture only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale a seen by his living hunter but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some detail not the most correct presentation of whale and whaling scene to be anywhere found are two large french engraving well executed and taken from painting by one garnery respectively they represent attack on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundity of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven plank the prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monster s spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping a if from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true the half emptied line tub float on the whitened sea the wooden pole of the spilled harpoon obliquely bob in it the head of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expression of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical detail of this whale but let that pas since for the life of me i could not draw so good a one in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that roll his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from the patagonian cliff his jet are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowel below sea fowl are pecking at the small crab shell fish and other sea candy and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carry on his pestilent back and all the while the thick lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving ton of tumultuous white curd in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swell like a skiff caught nigh the paddle wheel of an ocean steamer thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sail of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale pole inserted into his spout hole who garnery the painter is or wa i know not but my life for it he wa either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lad for painting action go and gaze upon all the painting of europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas a in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fight his way pell mell through the consecutive great battle of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern light and the successive armed king and emperor dash by like a charge of crowned centaur not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battle piece of garnery the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of thing seems to be peculiarly evinced in what painting and engraving they have of their whaling scene with not one tenth of england s experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the american they have nevertheless furnished both nation with the only finished sketch at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale draughtsman seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of thing such a the vacant profile of the whale which so far a picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving u a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniature of narwhale and porpoise treat u to a series of classical engraving of boat hook chopping knife and grapnel and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety six fac simile of magnified arctic snow crystal i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager i honor him for a veteran but in so important a matter it wa certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace in addition to those fine engraving from garnery there are two other french engraving worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other account it is a quiet noon scene among the isle of the pacific a french whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sail of the ship and the long leaf of the palm in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when considered with reference to it presenting the hardy fisherman under one of their few aspect of oriental repose the other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hove to upon the open sea and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the act of cutting in hove over to the monster a if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whale in the distance the harpoon and lance lie levelled for use three oarsman are just setting the mast in it hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stand half erect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torment of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithy and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squall and rain seems to quicken the activity of the excited seaman chapter of whale in paint in teeth in wood in sheet iron in stone in mountain in star on tower hill a you go down to the london dock you may have seen a crippled beggar or kedger a the sailor say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg there are three whale and three boat and one of the boat presumed to contain the missing leg in all it original integrity is being crunched by the jaw of the foremost whale any time these ten year they tell me ha that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification ha now come his three whale are a good whale a were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump a unquestionable a stump a any you will find in the western clearing but though for ever mounted on that stump never a stump speech doe the poor whaleman make but with downcast eye stand ruefully contemplating his own amputation throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketch of whale and whaling scene graven by the fisherman themselves on sperm whale teeth or lady busks wrought out of the right whale bone and other like skrimshander article a the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivance they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hour of ocean leisure some of them have little box of dentistical looking implement specially intended for the skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their jack knife alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner s fancy long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him i e what is called savagery your true whale hunter is a much a savage a an iroquois i myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibal and ready at any moment to rebel against him now one of the peculiar characteristic of the savage in his domestic hour is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian war club or spear paddle in it full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is a great a trophy of human perseverance a a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken sea shell or a shark s tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden net work ha been achieved and it ha cost steady year of steady application a with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailor savage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single shark s tooth of his one poor jack knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite a workmanlike but a close packed in it maziness of design a the greek savage achilles s shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness a the print of that fine old dutch savage albert durer wooden whale or whale cut in profile out of the small dark slab of the noble south sea war wood are frequently met with in the forecastle of american whaler some of them are done with much accuracy at some old gable roofed country house you will see brass whale hung by the tail for knocker to the road side door when the porter is sleepy the anvil headed whale would be best but these knocking whale are seldom remarkable a faithful essay on the spire of some old fashioned church you will see sheet iron whale placed there for weather cock but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intent and purpose so labelled with hand off you can not examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit in bony ribby region of the earth where at the base of high broken cliff mass of rock lie strewn in fantastic grouping upon the plain you will often discover image a of the petrified form of the leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day break against them in a surf of green surge then again in mountainous country where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical height here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpse of the profile of whale defined along the undulating ridge but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sight and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand point else so chance like are such observation of the hill that your precise previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the soloma island which still remain incognita though once high ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whale in the starry heaven and boat in pursuit of them a when long filled with thought of war the eastern nation saw army locked in battle among the cloud thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolution of the bright point that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic sky i have boarded the argo navis and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish with a frigate s anchor for my bridle bitt and fasces of harpoon for spur would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost sky to see whether the fabled heaven with all their countless tent really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight chapter brit steering north eastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadow of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feed for league and league it undulated round u so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless field of ripe and golden wheat on the second day number of right whale were seen who secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaw sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibre of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouth wa in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip a morning mower who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythe through the long wet grass of marshy mead even so these monster swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swath of blue upon the yellow sea that part of the sea known among whalemen a the brazil bank doe not bear that name a the bank of newfoundland do because of there being shallow and sounding there but because of this remarkable meadow like appearance caused by the vast drift of brit continually floating in those latitude where the right whale is often chased but it wa only the sound they made a they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mower seen from the mast head especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black form looked more like lifeless mass of rock than anything else and a in the great hunting country of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pas on the plain recumbent elephant without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevation of the soil even so often with him who for the first time beholds this specie of the leviathan of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense magnitude render it very hard really to believe that such bulky mass of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all part with the same sort of life that life in a dog or a horse indeed in other respect you can hardly regard any creature of the deep with the same feeling that you do those of the shore for though some old naturalist have maintained that all creature of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialty where for example doe the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answer to the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him but though to landsman in general the native inhabitant of the sea have ever been regarded with emotion unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown world to discover his one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific of all mortal disaster have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen ten and hundred of thousand of those who have gone upon the water though but a moment s consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impression man ha lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it the

the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering mast mildly waved to that languid breeze a three mild palm on a plain and still at wide interval in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burnished sun glade on the water seemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered wave whispered together a they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre wa seen by daggoo from the main mast head in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snow slide new slid from the hill thus glistening for a moment a slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on re appearing once more with a stiletto like cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled out there there again there she breach right ahead the white whale the white whale upon this the seaman rushed to the yard arm a in swarming time the bee rush to the bough bare headed in the sultry sun ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his order to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he wa now prepared to connect the idea of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued however this wa or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave order for lowering the four boat were soon on the water ahab s in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oar suspended we were awaiting it reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thought of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret sea have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlong in length and breadth of a glancing cream colour lay floating on the water innumerable long arm radiating from it centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anaconda a if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billow an unearthly formless chance like apparition of life a with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated water where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimed almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost what wa it sir said flask the great live squid which they say few whale ship ever beheld and returned to their port to tell of it but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest a silently following whatever superstition the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance ha gone far to invest it with portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague idea concerning it true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food for though other specie of whale find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zone below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists at time when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arm of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty foot in length they fancy that the monster to which these arm belonged ordinarily cling by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other specie is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in which the bishop describes it a alternately rising and sinking with some other particular he narrates in all this the two correspond but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it by some naturalist who have vaguely heard rumor of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttle fish to which indeed in certain external respect it would seem to belong but only a the anak of the tribe chapter the line with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described a well a for the better understanding of all similar scene elsewhere presented i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale line the line originally used in the fishery wa of the best hemp slightly vapored with tar not impregnated with it a in the case of ordinary rope for while tar a ordinarily used make the hemp more pliable to the rope maker and also render the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected but a most seaman are beginning to learn tar in general by no mean add to the rope s durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss of late year the manilla rope ha in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp a a material for whale line for though not so durable a hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an sthetics in all thing is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla is a a golden haired circassian to behold the whale line is only two third of an inch in thickness at first sight you would not think it so strong a it really is by experiment it one and fifty yarn will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pound so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three ton in length the common sperm whale line measure something over two hundred fathom towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the worm pipe of a still though but so a to form one round cheese shaped mass of densely bedded sheaf or layer of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese a the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebody s arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in it tub some harpooneer will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so a in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkle and twist in the english boat two tub are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tub there is some advantage in this because these twin tub being so small they fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly three foot in diameter and of proportionate depth make a rather bulky freight for a craft whose plank are but one half inch in thickness for the bottom of the whale boat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line tub the boat look a if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding cake to present to the whale both end of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eye splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over it edge completely disengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two account first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep a to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instance the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale a it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist it consort second this arrangement is indispensable for common safety s sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute a he sometimes doe he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no town crier would ever find her again before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man s oar so that it jog against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men a they alternately sit at the opposite gunwale to the leaded chock or groove in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chock it hang in a slight festoon over the bow and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathom called box line being coiled upon the box in the bow it continues it way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is then attached to the short warp the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the short warp go through sundry mystification too tedious to detail thus the whale line fold the whole boat in it complicated coil twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the oarsman are involved in it perilous contortion so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem a indian juggler with the deadliest snake sportively festooning their limb nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacy and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortion be put in play like ringed lightning he can not be thus circumstanced without a shudder that make the very marrow in his bone to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habit strange thing what can not habit accomplish gayer sally more merry mirth better joke and brighter repartee you never heard over your mahogany than you will hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat when thus hung in hangman s noose and like the six burgher of calais before king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaw of death with a halter around every neck a you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disaster some few of which are casually chronicled of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam engine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for you can not sit motionless in the heart of these peril because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain self adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the all seeing sun himself could never pierce you out again a the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself a the seemingly harmless rifle hold the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line a it silently serpentines about the oarsman before being brought into actual play this is a thing which carry more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men live enveloped in whale line all are born with halter round their neck but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortal realize the silent subtle ever present peril of life and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whale boat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side chapter stubb kill a whale if to starbuck the apparition of the squid wa a thing of portent to queequeg it wa quite a different object when you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale the next day wa exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the pequod s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpse of porpoise dolphin flying fish and other vivacious denizen of more stirring water than those off the rio de la plata or the in shore ground off peru it wa my turn to stand at the foremast head and with my shoulder leaning against the slackened royal shroud to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway a a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seaman at the main and mizzen mast head were already drowsy so that at last all three of u lifelessly swung from the spar and for every swing that we made there wa a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman the wave too nodded their indolent crest and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all suddenly bubble seemed bursting beneath my closed eye like vice my hand grasped the shroud some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathom off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the sun s ray like a mirror but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale wa thy last a if struck by some enchanter s wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voice from all part of the vessel simultaneously with the three note from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry a the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air clear away the boat luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spoke the sudden exclamation of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boat were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripple a he swam that thinking after all he might not a yet be alarmed ahab gave order that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whisper so seated like ontario indian on the gunwale of the boat we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sail being set presently a we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty foot into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up there go fluke wa the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite wa granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smoker s boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honor of the capture it wa obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuer all silence of cautiousness wa therefore no longer of use paddle were dropped and oar came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy he wa going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale s enormous head consists though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably doe so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cut water formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot boat start her start her my men don t hurry yourselves take plenty of time but start

the gay header in reply raising some old war whoop to the sky a every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave but

smacking his lip over a mouthful of grenadier s steak and thus with oar and yell the keel cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth like desperado they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry wa heard stand up tashtego give it to him the harpoon wa hurled stern all the oarsman backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrist it wa the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turn with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of it increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fume from his pipe a the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb s hand from which the hand cloth or square of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these time had accidentally dropped it wa like holding an enemy s sharp two edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed sea water into it more turn were taken so that the line began holding it place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fin stubb and tashtego here changed place stem for stern a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop wa used to dash the running line with water in many other ship a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from it now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keel one cleaving the water the other the air a the boat churned on through both opposing element at once a continual cascade played at the bow a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantic and pacific seemed passed a they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight haul in haul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hand began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat wa being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale s horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling the red tide now poured from all side of the monster like brook down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlong behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back it reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after jet of white smoke wa agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman a at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blow against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale pull up pull up he now cried to the bowsman a the waning whale relaxed in his wrath pull up close to and the boat ranged along the fish s flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning a if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he wa fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought wa the innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout hole with sharp cracking agonized respiration at last gush after gush of clotted red gore a if it had been the purple lee of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flank into the sea his heart had burst he s dead mr stubb said daggoo yes both pipe smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ash over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made chapter the dart a word concerning an incident in the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale boat push off from the ship with the headsman or whale killer a temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whale fastener pulling the foremost oar the one known a the harpooneer oar now it need a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement ha to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty foot but however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamation and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one s compass while all the other muscle are strained and half started what that is none know but those who have tried it for one i can not bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry stand up and give it to him he now ha to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essay to pitch it somehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty fair chance for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneer are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood vessel in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four year with four barrel no wonder that to many ship owner whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that make the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale start to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else it is then they change place and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft take his proper station in the bow of the boat now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bow from first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstance obvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation ha convinced me that in the vast majority of failure in the fishery it ha not by any mean been so much the speed of the whale a the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that ha caused them to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneer of this world must start to their foot from out of idleness and not from out of toil chapter the crotch out of the trunk the branch grow out of them the twig so in productive subject grow the chapter the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two foot in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly project from the prow thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to it hurler who snatch it up a readily from it rest a a backwoodsman swing his rifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoon reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second iron but these two harpoon each by it own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chance but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightning like in his movement to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless a the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all event be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hand tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such case the spare coil of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instance prudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualty furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharp edged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the line or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all direction nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse consider now how it must be in the case of four boat all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these quality in him a well a to the thousand concurring accident of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second iron may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied with several harpoon to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particular are faithfully narrated here a they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passage in scene hereafter to be painted chapter stubb s supper stubb s whale had been killed some distance from the ship it wa a calm so forming a tandem of three boat we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now a we eighteen men with our thirty six arm and one hundred and eighty thumb and finger slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long interval good evidence wa hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hang ho or whatever they call it in china four or five laborer on the foot path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along a if laden with pig lead in bulk darkness came on but three light up and down in the pequod s main rigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lantern over the bulwark vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual order for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature wa dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him a if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick wa yet to be slain and though a thousand other whale were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod s deck that all hand were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chain are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the port hole but by those clanking link the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bow the whale now lie with it black hull close to the vessel s and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spar and rigging aloft the two ship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullock whereof one reclines while the other remains standing a little item may a well be related here the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship ha upon the whale when moored alongside is by the fluke or tail and a from it greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side fin it flexibility even in death cause it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you can not get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at it outer end and a weight in it middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with it broad fluke or lobe if moody ahab wa now all quiescence at least so far a could be known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still good natured excitement such an unwonted bustle wa he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affair one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb wa soon made strangely manifest stubb wa a high liver he wa somewhat intemperately fond of the whale a a flavorish thing to his palate a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small here be it known that though these wild fisherman do not a a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expense of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak wa cut and cooked and lighted by two lantern of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan head a if that capstan were a sideboard nor wa stubb the only banqueter on whale s flesh that night mingling their mumbling with his own mastication thousand on thousand of shark swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on it fatness the few sleeper below in their bunk were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tail against the hull within a few inch of the sleeper heart peering over the side you could just see them a before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black water and turning over on their back a they scooped out huge globular piece of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthful remains a part of the universal problem of all thing the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight shark will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship s deck like hungry dog round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butcher over the deck table are thus cannibally carving each other s live meat with carving knife all gilded and tasselled the shark also with their jewel hilted mouth are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all party and though shark also are the invariable outrider of all slave ship crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instance might be set down touching the set term place and occasion when shark do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless number and in gayer or more jovial spirit than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil worship and the expediency of conciliating the devil but a yet stubb heeded not the mumbling of the banquet that wa going on so nigh him no more than the shark heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lip cook cook where s that old fleece he cried at length widening his leg still further a if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish a if stabbing with his lance cook you cook sail this way cook the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old black there wa something the matter with his knee pan which he did not keep well scoured like his other pan this old fleece a they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoop this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb s sideboard when with both hand folded before him and resting on his two legged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so a to bring his best ear into play cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth don t you think this steak is rather overdone you ve been beating this steak too much cook it s too tender don t i always say that to be good a whale steak must be tough there are those shark now over the side don t you see they prefer it tough and rare what a shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to em tell em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and deliver my message here take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard now then go and preach to em sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwark and then with one hand dropping his light low over the sea so a to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the shark while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that wa said fellow critter i se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin ob de lip massa stubb say dat you can fill your dam belly up to de hatching but by gor you must stop dat dam racket cook here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder cook why damn your eye you mustn t swear

voice and cried cussed fellow critter kick up de damndest row a ever you can fill your dam belly till dey bust and den die now cook said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan stand just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular attention all dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you cook what dat do wid de teak said the old black testily silence how old are you cook bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred year cook and don t know yet how to cook a whale steak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question where were you born cook hind de hatchway in ferry boat goin ober de roanoke born in a ferry boat that s queer too but i want to know what country you were born in cook didn t i say de roanoke country he cried sharply no you didn t cook but i ll tell you what i m coming to cook you must go home and be born over again you don t know how to cook a whale steak yet bress my soul if i cook noder one he growled angrily turning round to depart come back cook here hand me those tongs now take that bit of steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked a it should be take it i say holding the tongs towards him take it and taste it faintly smacking his withered lip over it for a moment the old negro muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the church passed one once in cape down said the old man sullenly and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape town where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearer a his beloved fellow creature have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie a you did just now eh said stubb where do you expect to go to cook go to bed berry soon he mumbled half turning a he spoke avast heave to i mean when you die cook it s an awful question now what s your answer when dis old brack man dy said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor he hisself won t go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch him fetch him how in a coach and four a they fetched elijah and fetch him where

grizzled head a if to get both ear in front at one and the same time well then cook you see this whale steak of yours wa so very bad that i have put it out of sight a soon a possible you see that don t you well for the future when you cook another whale steak for my private table here the capstan i ll tell you what to do so a not to spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it d ye hear and now to morrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tip of his fin have them put in pickle a for the end of the fluke have them soused cook there now ye may go but fleece had hardly got three pace off when he wa recalled cook give me cutlet for supper to morrow night in the mid watch d ye hear away you sail then halloa stop make a bow before you go avast heaving again whale ball for breakfast don t forget wish by gor whale eat him stead of him eat whale i m bressed if he ain t more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock chapter the whale a a dish that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feed his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light a you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must need go a little into the history and philosophy of it it is upon record that three century ago the tongue of the right whale wa esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large price there also that in henry viiith s time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoise which you remember are a specie of whale porpoise indeed are to this day considered fine eating the meat is made into ball about the size of billiard ball and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle ball or veal ball the old monk of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the crown the fact is that among his hunter at least the whale would by all hand be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meat pie nearly one hundred foot long it take away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whale but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whale and have rare old vintage of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doctor recommends strip of blubber for infant a being exceedingly juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishman who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel that these men actually lived for several month on the mouldy scrap of whale which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scrap are called fritter which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old amsterdam housewife dough nut or oly cook when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most self denying stranger can hardly keep his hand off but what further depreciates the whale a a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which would be a fine eating a the buffalo s which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent half jellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of it growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watch of the night it is a common thing for the seaman to dip their ship biscuit into the huge oil pot and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made in the case of a small sperm whale the brain are accounted a fine dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobe being withdrawn precisely resembling two large pudding they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calf head which is quite a dish among some epicure and every one know that some young buck among the epicure by continually dining upon calf brain by and by get to have a little brain of their own so a to be able to tell a calf s head from their own head which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf s head before him is somehow one of the saddest sight you can see the head look a sort of reproachfully at him with an et tu brute expression it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsman seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned i e that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by it own light but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox wa regarded a a murderer perhaps he wa hung and if he had been put on his trial by ox he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer doe go to the meat market of a saturday night and see the crowd of live biped staring up at the long row of dead quadruped doe not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal s jaw cannibal who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest goose to the ground and feastest on their bloated liver in thy pat de foie gras but stubb he eats the whale by it own light doe he and that is adding insult to injury is it look at your knife handle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made of what but the bone of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to gander formally indite his circular it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pen chapter the shark massacre when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not a a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires all hand to set about it therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm a lee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchor watch shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all go well but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable host of shark gather round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hour say on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning in most other part of the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at time considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling spade a procedure notwithstanding which in some instance only seems to tickle them into still greater activity but it wa not thus in the present case with the pequod s shark though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sight to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea wa one huge cheese and those shark the maggot in it nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchor watch after his supper wa concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitement wa created among the shark for immediately suspending the cutting stage over the side and lowering three lantern so that they cast long gleam of light over the turbid sea these two mariner darting their long whaling spade kept up an incessant murdering of the shark by striking the keen steel deep into their skull seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling host the marksman could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelation of the incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each other s disembowelment but like flexible bow bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor wa this all it wa unsafe to meddle with the corps and ghost of these creature a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joint and bone after what might be called the individual life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these shark almost took poor queequeg s hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw the whaling spade used for cutting in is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a man s spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only it side are perfectly flat and it upper end considerably narrower than the lower this weapon is always kept a sharp a possible and when being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in it socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty foot long is inserted for a handle queequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly lifting his hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin chapter cutting in it wa a saturday night and such a sabbath a followed ex officio professor of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod wa turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red ox to the sea god in the first place the enormous cutting tackle among other ponderous thing comprising a cluster of block generally painted green and which no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grape wa swayed up to the main top and firmly lashed to the lower mast head the strongest point anywhere above a ship s deck the end of the hawser like rope winding through these intricacy wa then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackle wa swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pound wa attached and now suspended in stage over the side starbuck and stubb the mate armed with their long spade began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side fin this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship careen over on her side every bolt in her start like the nail head of an old house in frosty weather she tremble quiver and nod her frighted mast head to the sky more and more she lean over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billow till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship roll upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rise into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now a the blubber envelope the whale precisely a the rind doe an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely a an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keep the whale rolling over and over in the water and a the blubber in one strip uniformly peel off along the line called the scarf simultaneously cut by the spade of starbuck and stubb the mate and just a fast a it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till it upper end graz the main top the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blood dripping mass sway to and fro a if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swing else it may box his ear and pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneer now advance with a long keen weapon called a boarding sword and watching his chance he dexterously slice out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so a to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hand to stand off once more make a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicing severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanket piece swing clear and is all ready for lowering the heaver forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down go the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber room into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hand keep coiling away the long blanket piece a if it were a great live mass of plaited serpent and thus the work proceeds the two tackle hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heaver singing the blubber room gentleman coiling the mate scarfing the ship straining and all hand swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction chapter the blanket i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale i have had controversy about it with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalist ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence of firm close grained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and range from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inch in thickness now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature s skin a being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fact these are no argument against such a presumption because you can not raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale s body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shred of isinglass only it is almost a flexible and soft a satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contract and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bit which i use for mark in my whale book it is transparent a i said before and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whale through their own spectacle a you may say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded a the skin of the creature a the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new born child but no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin a in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrel of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in it expressed state is only three fourth and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yield such a lake of liquid a that reckoning ten barrel to the ton you have ten ton for the net weight of only three quarter of the stuff of the whale s skin in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvel he present almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re crossed with numberless straight mark in thick array something like those in the finest italian line engraving but these mark do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it a if they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some instance to the quick observant eye those linear mark a in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineation these are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cypher on the wall of pyramid hieroglyphic then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphic upon one sperm whale in particular i wa much struck with a plate representing the old indian character chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisade on the bank of the upper mississippi like those mystic rock too the mystic marked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian rock reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomenon which the exterior of the sperm whale present he not seldom display the back and more especially his flank effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratch altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new england rock on the sea coast which agassiz imago to bear the mark of violent scraping contact with vast floating iceberg i should say that those rock must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me that such scratch in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whale for i have most remarked them in the large full grown bull of the specie a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale it ha already been said that it is stript from him in long piece called blanket piece like most sea term this one is very happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber a in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weather in all sea time and tide what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy sea of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean water but these be it observed are your cold blooded lungless fish whose very belly are refrigerator creature that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg a a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale ha lung and warm blood freeze his blood and he dy how wonderful is it then except after explanation that this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is a indispensable a it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lip for life in those arctic water where when seaman fall overboard they are sometimes found month afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the heart of field of ice a a fly is found glued in amber but more surprising is it to know a ha been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer it doe seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick wall and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peter s and like the great whale retain o man in all season a temperature of thine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine thing of erection how few are domed like st peter s of creature how few vast a the whale chapter the funeral haul in the chain let the carcase go astern the vast tackle have now done their duty the peeled white body of the beheaded whale flash like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it ha not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal slowly it float more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate shark and the air above vexed with rapacious flight of screaming fowl whose beak are like so many insulting poniard in the whale the vast white headless phantom float further and further from the ship and every rod that it so float what seem square rood of shark and cubic rood of fowl augment the murderous din for hour and hour from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breeze that great mass of death float on and on till lost in infinite perspective there s a most doleful and most mocking funeral the sea vulture all in pious mourning the air shark all punctiliously in black or speckled in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free nor is this the end desecrated a the body is a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare espied by some timid man of war or blundering discovery vessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowl nevertheless still show the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whale s unharming corpse with trembling finger is set down in the log shoal rock and breaker hereabouts beware and for year afterwards perhaps ship shun the place leaping over it a silly sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there when a stick wa held there s your law of precedent there s your utility of tradition there s the story of your obstinate survival of old belief never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air there s orthodoxy thus while in life the great whale s body may have been a real terror to his foe in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world are you a believer in ghost my friend there are other ghost than the cock lane one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in them chapter the sphynx it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan he wa beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeon very much pride themselves and not without reason consider that the whale ha nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten foot intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstance he ha to cut many foot deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much a getting one single peep into the ever contracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted part and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by it insertion into the skull do you not marvel then at stubb s boast that he demanded but ten minute to behead a sperm whale when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whale s head embrace nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden a that even by the immense tackle of a whaler this were a vain a thing a to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jeweller scale the pequod s whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head wa hoisted against the ship s side about half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by it native element and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast head and every yard arm on that side projecting like a crane over the wave there that blood dripping head hung to the pequod s waist like the giant holofernes s from the girdle of judith when this last task wa accomplished it wa noon and the seaman went below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus wa more and more unfolding it noiseless measureless leaf upon the sea a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin taking a few turn on the quarter deck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the main chain he took stubb s long spade still remaining there after the whale s decapitation and striking it into the lower part of the half suspended mass placed it other end crutch wise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eye attentively fixed on this head it wa a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the sphynx s in the desert speak thou vast and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with moss speak mighty head and tell u the secret thing that is in thee of all diver thou hast dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleam ha moved amid this world s foundation where unrecorded name and navy rust and untold hope and anchor rot where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bone of million of the drowned there in that awful water land there wa thy most familiar home thou hast been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailor s side where sleepless mother would give their life to lay them down thou saw st the locked lover when leaping from their flaming ship heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when heaven seemed false to them thou saw st the murdered mate when tossed by pirate from the midnight deck for hour he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderer still sailed on unharmed while swift lightning shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arm o head thou hast seen enough to split the planet and make an infidel of abraham and not one syllable is thine sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the main mast head aye well now that s cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting himself while whole thunder cloud swept aside from his brow that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man where away three point on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to u better and better man would now st paul would come along that way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogy not the smallest atom stir or life on matter but ha it cunning duplicate in mind chapter the jeroboam s story hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the pequod began to rock by and by through the glass the stranger s boat and manned mast head proved her a whale ship but a she wa so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal wa set to see what response would be made here be it said that like the vessel of military marine the ship of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signal being collected in a book with the name of the respective vessel attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale commander are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distance and with no small facility the pequod s signal wa at last responded to by the stranger s setting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring her yard she bore down ranged abeam under the pequod s lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but a the side ladder wa being rigged by starbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain wa fearful of infecting the pequod s company for though himself and boat s crew remained untainted and though his ship wa half a rifle shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod but this did by no mean prevent all communication preserving an interval of some few yard between itself and the ship the jeroboam s boat by the occasional use of it oar contrived to keep parallel to the pequod a she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her main topsail aback though indeed at time by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearing again subject to this and other the like interruption now and then a conversation wa sustained between the two party but at interval not without still another interruption of a very different sort pulling an oar in the jeroboam s boat wa a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notability make up all totality he wa a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with freckle and wearing redundant yellow hair a long skirted cabalistically cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeve of which were rolled up on his wrist a deep settled fanatic delirium wa in his eye so soon a this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimed that s he that s he the long togged scaramouch the town ho s company told u of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spoke the town ho according to this account and what wa subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story wa this he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shaker where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meeting having several time descended from heaven by the way of a trap door announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vest pocket but which instead of containing gunpowder wa supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady common sense exterior and offered himself a a green hand candidate for the jeroboam s whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon the ship s getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet he announced himself a the archangel gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth a the deliverer of the isle of the sea and vicar general of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these thing the dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terror of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the mind of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of him a such a man however wa not of much practical use in the ship especially a he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individual s intention wa to land him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seal and vial devoting the ship and all hand to unconditional perdition in case this intention wa carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciple among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel wa sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he wa therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pas that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all this wa that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mate and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague a he called it wa at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailor mostly poor devil cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his instruction sometimes rendering him personal homage a to a god such thing may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatic half so striking in respect to the measureless self deception of the fanatic himself a his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the pequod i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwark to captain mayhew who stood in the boat s stern come on board but now gabriel started to his foot think think of the fever yellow and bilious beware of the horrible plague gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and it seethings drowned all speech hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted back think think of thy whale boat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible tail i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead a if dragged by fiend nothing wa said for some moment while a succession of riotous wave rolled by which by one of those occasional caprice of the sea were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm whale s head jogged about very violently and gabriel wa seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant when this interlude wa over captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruption from gabriel whenever his name wa mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whale ship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shaker receiving the bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick wa fairly sighted from the mast head macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangel s denunciation and forewarning macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onset he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to the main royal mast head wa tossing one arm in frantic gesture and hurling forth prophecy of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailant of his divinity now while macey the mate wa standing up in his boat s bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe wa venting his wild exclamation upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by it quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the body of the oarsman next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life wa smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yard not a chip of the boat wa harmed nor a hair of any oarsman s head but the mate for ever sank it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accident in the sperm whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost a frequent a any sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boat s bow is knocked off or the thigh board in which the headsman stand is torn from it place and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instance than one when the body ha been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead the whole calamity with the falling form of macey wa plainly descried from the ship raising a piercing shriek the vial the vial gabriel called off the terror stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciple believed that he had specifically fore announced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many mark in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such question to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab answered aye straightway then gabriel once more started to his foot glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed finger think think of the blasphemer dead and down there beware of the blasphemer s end ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have just bethought me of my letter bag there is a letter for one of thy officer if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag every whale ship take out a goodly number of letter for various ship whose delivery to the person to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four ocean thus most letter never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three year or more soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it wa sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the post boy can st not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye it s but a dim scrawl what s this a he wa studying it out starbuck took a long cutting spade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without it coming any closer to the ship meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr har yes mr harry a woman s pinny hand the man s wife i ll wager aye mr harry macey ship jeroboam why it s macey and he s dead poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let me have it nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going that way curse throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbuck s hand he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat but a he did so the oarsman expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ship s stern so that a if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel s eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boat knife and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahab s foot then gabriel shrieked out to his comrade to give way with their oar and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod a after this interlude the seaman resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange thing were hinted in reference to this wild affair chapter the monkey rope in the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forward among the crew now hand are wanted here and then again hand are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything ha to be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavor the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it wa mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale s back the blubber hook wa inserted into the original hole there cut by the spade of the mate but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass a that same hook get fixed in that hole it wa inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it wa a harpooneer to descend upon the monster s back for the special purpose referred to but in very many case circumstance require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded the whale be it observed lie almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate part operated upon so down there some ten foot below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounder about half on the whale and half in the water a the vast mass revolves like a tread mill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costume a shirt and sock in which to my eye at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him a will presently be seen being the savage s bowsman that is the person who pulled the bow oar in his boat the second one from forward it wa my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard scrabble scramble upon the dead whale s back you have seen italian organ boy holding a dancing ape by a long cord just so from the ship s steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey rope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist it wa a humorously perilous business for both of u for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkey rope wa fast at both end fast to queequeg s broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united u queequeg wa my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liability which the hempen bond entailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motion i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality wa now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that another s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death therefore i saw that here wa a sort of interregnum in providence for it even handed equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further pondering while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam him still further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine wa the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most case he one way or other ha this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortal if your banker break you snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pill you die true you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chance of life but handle queequeg s monkey rope heedfully a i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it the monkey rope is found in all whaler but it wa only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original usage wa introduced by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey rope holder i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this wa not the only jamming jeopardy he wa exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the shark now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creature swarmed round it like bee in a beehive and right in among those shark wa queequeg who often pushed them aside with his floundering foot a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey a a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkey rope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark he wa provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stage tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale spade wherewith they slaughtered a many shark a they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure wa very disinterested and benevolent of them they meant queequeg s best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the shark were at time half hidden by the blood muddled water those indiscreet spade of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hook poor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his yojo and gave up his life into the hand of his god well well my dear comrade and twin brother thought i a i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matter it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of u men in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those shark your foe those spade your friend and what between shark and spade you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now a with blue lip and blood shot eye the exhausted savage at last climb up the chain and stand all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advance and with a benevolent consolatory glance hand him what some hot cognac no hand him ye god hand him a cup of tepid ginger and water ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near yes this must be ginger peering into the a yet untasted cup then standing a if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me mr dough boy where lie the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use dough boy to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ginger what the devil is ginger sea coal firewood lucifer match tinder gunpowder what the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please then watching the mate s countenance he added the steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitter by which he blow back the life into a half drowned man i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough aye aye steward cried stubb we ll teach you to drug a harpooneer none of your apothecary s medicine here you want to poison u do ye you have got out insurance on our life and want to murder u all and pocket the proceeds do ye it wa not me cried dough boy it wa aunt charity that brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneer any spirit but only this ginger jub so she called it ginger jub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the locker and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captain s order grog for the harpooneer on a whale enough replied starbuck only don t hit him again but oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellow s a weazel what were you about saying sir only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea caddy in the other the first contained strong spirit and wa handed to queequeg the second wa aunt charity s gift and that wa freely given to the wave chapter stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk over him it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale s prodigious head hanging to the pequod s side but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matter press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackle may hold now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by it occasional patch of yellow brit gave unusual token of the vicinity of right whale a specie of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near and though all hand commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creature and though the pequod wa not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed number of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement wa made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered nor wa this long wanting tall spout were seen to leeward and two boat stubb s and flask s were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast head but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boat must be fast an interval passed and the boat were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemed a if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rod of the plank he wholly disappeared from view a if diving under the keel cut cut wa the cry from the ship to the boat which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel s side but having plenty of line yet in the tub and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so a to get ahead of the ship for a few minute the struggle wa intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oar in another the contending strain threatened to take them under but it wa only a few foot advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor wa felt running like lightning along the keel a the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bow snapping and quivering and so flinging off it dripping that the drop fell like bit of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boat were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boat after him so that they performed a complete circuit meantime they hauled more and more upon their line till close flanking him on both side stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitude of shark that had before swum round the sperm whale s body rushed to the fresh blood that wa spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash a the eager israelite did at the new bursting fountain that poured from the smitten rock at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse while the two headsman were engaged in making fast cord to his fluke and in other way getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them i wonder what the old man want with this lump of foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan want with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boat s bow did you never hear that the ship which but once ha a sperm whale s head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whale s on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize why not i don t know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ship charm but i sometimes think he ll charm the ship to no good at last i don t half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake s head stubb sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwark and no one by look down there flask pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hand aye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship he s the devil i say the reason why you don t see his tail is because he tuck it up out of sight he carry it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it he s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toe of his boot he sleep in his boot don t he he hasn t got any hammock but i ve seen him lay of night in a coil of rigging no doubt and it s because of his cursed tail he coil it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging what s the old man have so much to do with him for striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose bargain about what why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then he ll surrender moby dick pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that i don t know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye why they say a how he went a sauntering into the old flag ship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor wa at home well he wa at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching his hoof up and say i want john what for say the old governor what business is that of yours say the devil getting mad i want to use him take him say the governor and by the lord flask if the devil didn t give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him i ll eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharp ain t you all ready there well then pull ahead and let s get the whale alongside i think i remember some such story a you were telling said flask when at last the two boat were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but i can t remember where three spaniard adventure of those three bloody minded soldadoes did ye read it there flask i guess ye did no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me stubb do you suppose that that devil you wa speaking of just now wa the same you say is now on board the pequod am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesn t the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil wa dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil ha a latch key to get into the admiral s cabin don t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well that s the figure one now take all the hoop in the pequod s hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldn t begin to be fedallah s age nor all the cooper in creation couldn t show hoop enough to make oughts enough but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a sea toss if you got a good chance now if he s so old a all those hoop of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboard tell me that give him a good ducking anyhow but he d crawl back duck him again and keep ducking him suppose he should take it into his head to duck you though yes and drown you what then i should like to see him try it i d give him such a pair of black eye that he wouldn t dare to show his face in the admiral s cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he life and hereabouts on the upper deck where he sneak so much damn the devil flask so you suppose i m afraid of the devil who s afraid of him except the old governor who daresn t catch him and put him in double darbies a he deserves but let him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped he d roast for him there s a governor do you suppose fedallah want to kidnap captain ahab do i suppose it you ll know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp look out on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on i ll just take him by the nape of his neck and say look here beelzebub you don t do it and if he make any fuss by the lord i ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stump do you see and then i rather guess when he find himself docked in that queer fashion he ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his leg and what will you do with the tail stubb do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get home what else now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb mean or not mean here we are at the ship the boat were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chain and other necessary were already prepared for securing him didn t i tell you so said flask yes you ll soon see this right whale s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti s in good time flask s saying proved true a before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale s head now by the counterpoise of both head she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in locke s head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant s and you come back again but in very poor plight thus some mind for ever keep trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunder head overboard and then you will float light and right in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceeding commonly take place a in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lip and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown piece but nothing like this in the present case had been done the carcase of both whale had dropped astern and the head laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening pannier meantime fedallah wa calmly eyeing the right whale s head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkle there to the line in his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the parsee s shadow wa there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahab s a the crew toiled on laplandish speculation were bandied among them concerning all these passing thing chapter the sperm whale s head contrasted view here now are two great whale laying their head together let u join them and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathan the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whale regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extreme of all the known variety of the whale a the external difference between them is mainly observable in their head and a a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod s side and a we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deck where i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these head both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale s which the right whale s sadly lack there is more character in the sperm whale s head a you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fisherman technically call a grey headed whale let u now note what is least dissimilar in these head namely the two most important organ the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whale s jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colt s eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale s eye it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whale s eye corresponds to that of a man s ear and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey object through your ear you would find that you could only command some thirty degree of vision in advance of the straight side line of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two back so to speak but at the same time also two front side front for what is it that make the front of a man what indeed but his eye moreover while in most other animal that i can now think of the eye are so planted a imperceptibly to blend their visual power so a to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whale s eye effectually divided a they are by many cubic foot of solid head which tower between them like a great mountain separating two lake in valley this of course must wholly separate the impression which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentry box with two joined sash for his window but with the whale these two sash are separately inserted making two distinct window but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whale s eye is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scene a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter a touching the leviathan but i must be content with a hint so long a a man s eye are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he can not then help mechanically seeing whatever object are before him nevertheless any one s experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of thing at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two thing however large or however small at one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two object and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner a to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eye in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than man s that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospect one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he can then is it a marvellous a thing in him a if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstration of two distinct problem in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle whim but it ha always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillation of movement displayed by some whale when beset by three or four boat the timidity and liability to queer fright so common to such whale i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite power of vision must involve them but the ear of the whale is full a curious a the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two head for hour and never discover that organ the ear ha no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ear this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former ha an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so a to be quite imperceptible from without is it not curious that so vast a being a the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare s but if his eye were broad a the lens of herschel s great telescope and his ear capacious a the porch of cathedral would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at all why then do you try to enlarge your mind subtilize it let u now with whatever lever and steam engine we have at hand cant over the sperm whale s head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let u hold on here by this tooth and look about u where we are what a really beautiful and chaste looking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy a bridal satin but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so a to get it overhead and expose it row of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such ala it prof to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spike fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathom down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen foot long hanging straight down at right angle with his body for all the world like a ship s jib boom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sort perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinge of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock jaw upon him in most case this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fisherman fashion all sort of curious article including cane umbrella stock and handle to riding whip with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board a if it were an anchor and when the proper time come some few day after the other work queequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentist are set to drawing teeth with a keen cutting spade queequeg lance the gum then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth a michigan ox drag stump of old oak out of wild wood land there are generally forty two teeth in all in old whale much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slab and piled away like joist for building house chapter the right whale s head contrasted view crossing the deck let u now have a good long look at the right whale s head a in general shape the noble sperm whale s head may be compared to a roman war chariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the right whale s head bear a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot toed shoe two hundred year ago an old dutch voyager likened it shape to that of a shoemaker s last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny but a you come nearer to this great head it begin to assume different aspect according to your point of view if you stand on it summit and look at these two f shaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol and these spiracle the aperture in it sounding board then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comb like incrustation on the top of the mass this green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fisher the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eye solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a bird s nest in it crotch at any rate when you watch those live crab that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy ha been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea whose green crown ha been put together for him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenter s measurement about twenty foot long and five foot deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some gallon of oil and more a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an important interval wa sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquake caused the beach to gape over this lip a over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve foot high and run to a pretty sharp angle a if there were a regular ridge pole there while these ribbed arched hairy side present u with those wondrous half vertical scimetar shaped slat of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blind which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned the edge of these bone are fringed with hairy fibre through which the right whale strain the water and in whose intricacy he retains the small fish when openmouthed he go through the sea of brit in feeding time in the central blind of bone a they stand in their natural order there are certain curious mark curve hollow and ridge whereby some whalemen calculate the creature s age a the age of an oak by it circular ring though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it ha the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable in old time there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancy concerning these blind one voyager in purchas call them the wondrous whisker inside of the whale s mouth another hog bristle a third old gentleman in hackluyt us the following elegant language there are about two hundred and fifty fin growing on each side of his upper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth this reminds u that the right whale really ha a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hair on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tuft impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance a every one know these same hog bristle fin whisker blind or whatever you please furnish to the lady their busks and other stiffening contrivance but in this particular the demand ha long been on the decline it wa in queen anne s time that the bone wa in it glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and a those ancient dame moved about gaily though in the jaw of the whale a you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaw for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone but now forget all about blind and whisker for a moment and standing in the right whale s mouth look around you afresh seeing all these colonnade of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon it thousand pipe for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkey the tongue which is glued a it were to the floor of the mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in piece in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before u at a passing glance i should say it wa a six barreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different head to sum up then in the right whale s there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whale s nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blind of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale ha two external spout hole the sperm whale only one look your last now on these venerable hooded head while they yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in following can you catch the expression of the sperm whale s there it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkle in the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie like placidity born of a speculative indifference a to death but mark the other head s expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessel s side so a firmly to embrace the jaw doe not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter year chapter the battering ram ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whale s head i would have you a a sensible physiologist simply particularly remark it front aspect in all it compacted collectedness i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever battering ram power may be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel a to one of the most appalling but not the less true event perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head present an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that the lower part of that front slope considerably backwards so a to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom like lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed a though your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale ha no external nose and that what nose he ha his spout hole is on the top of his head you observe that his eye and ear are at the side of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale s head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty foot from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is a one wad finally though a will soon be revealed it content partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wrap the body of the whale a the rind wrap an orange just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who ha not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebound from it it is a though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horse hoof i do not think that any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiaman chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the dock what do the sailor do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox hide that bravely and uninjured take the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspike and iron crow bar by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but supplementary to this it ha hypothetically occurred to me that a ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraction and a the sperm whale a far a i know ha no such provision in him considering too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swim with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of it envelope considering the unique interior of his head it ha hypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lung celled honeycomb there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so a to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destructive of all element contributes now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swim behind it all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated a piled wood is by the cord and all obedient to one volition a the smallest insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the speciality and concentration of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feat i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eye brow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giant only to encounter how small the chance for the provincial then what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess s veil at lais chapter the great heidelburgh tun now come the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon regarding the sperm whale s head a a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoin whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaw and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bone it broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal part which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics i know not that it ha been defined before a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having it sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both side the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand infiltrated cell of tough elastic white fibre throughout it whole extent the upper part known a the case may be regarded a the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and a that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whale s vast plaited forehead form innumerable strange device for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover a that of heidelburgh wa always replenished with the most excellent of the wine of the rhenish valley so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintage namely the highly prized spermaceti in it absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begin to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoot a when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whale s case generally yield about five hundred gallon of sperm though from unavoidable circumstance considerable of it is spilled leak and dribble away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun wa coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl coloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whale s case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embrace the entire length of the entire top of the head and since a ha been elsewhere set forth the head embrace one third of the whole length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty foot for a good sized whale you have more than twenty six foot for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship s side a in decapitating the whale the operator s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he ha therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out it invaluable content it is this decapitated end of the head also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackle whose hempen combination on one side make quite a wilderness of rope in that quarter thus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous and in this particular instance almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale s great heidelburgh tun is tapped chapter cistern and bucket nimble a a cat tashtego mount aloft and without altering his erect posture run straight out upon the overhanging mainyard arm to the part where it exactly project over the hoisted tun he ha carried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two part travelling through a single sheaved block securing this block so that it hang down from the yard arm he swing one end of the rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then hand over hand down the other part the indian drop through the air till dexterously he land on the summit of the head there still high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously cry he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayer from the top of a tower a short handled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently search for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasure hunter in some old house sounding the wall to find where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious search is over a stout iron bound bucket precisely like a well bucket ha been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hand these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person ha reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guide the bucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seaman at the whip up come the bucket again all bubbling like a dairy maid s pail of new milk carefully lowered from it height the full freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again go through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego ha to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun until some twenty foot of the pole have gone down now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tub had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened whether it wa that tashtego that wild indian wa so heedless and reckless a to let go for a moment his one handed hold on the great cabled tackle suspending the head or whether the place where he stood wa so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reason how it wa exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden a the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up my god poor tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped head foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to his sens swing the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so a the better to secure his slippery hand hold on the whip itself the hoister ran him high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reached it interior bottom meantime there wa a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea a if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it wa only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggle the perilous depth to which he had sunk at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head wa clearing the whip which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackle a sharp cracking noise wa heard and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hook suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook a if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motion of the head come down come down yelled the seaman to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackle so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out in heaven s name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridge there avast how will that help him jamming that iron bound bucket on top of his head avast will ye stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket almost in the same instant with a thunder boom the enormous mass dropped into the sea like niagara s table rock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath a half swinging now over the sailor head and now over the water daggoo through a thick mist of spray wa dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackle while poor buried alive tashtego wa sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a naked figure with a boarding sword in his hand wa for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwark the next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush wa made to the side and every eye counted every ripple a moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hand now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue wave a sight strange to see a an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave both both it is both cried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg wa seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego wa long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunge near it bottom so a to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg wa presented but well knowing that that wa not a it ought to be and might occasion great trouble he had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old way head foremost a for the great head itself that wa doing a well a could be expected and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego wa successfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediment which is a lesson by no mean to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the gay header s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsman though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one s falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the indian s considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale s well but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale wa the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of it lighter content leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well a double welded hammered substance a i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sink in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance wa in the present instance materially counteracted by the other part of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run a you may say yes it wa a running delivery so it wa now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be recalled the delicious death of an ohio honey hunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed how many think ye have likewise fallen into plato s honey head and sweetly perished there chapter the prairie to scan the line of his face or feel the bump on the head of this leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist ha a yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost a hopeful a for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkle on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treat of the various face of men but also attentively study the face of horse bird serpent and fish and dwells in detail upon the modification of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hint touching the phrenological characteristic of other being than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semi science to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all thing i achieve what i can physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he ha no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the feature and since it perhaps most modifies and finally control their combined expression hence it would seem that it entire absence a an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale for a in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open work belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidias s marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportion are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent a on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly boat your noble conception of him are never insulted by the reflection that he ha a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne in some particular perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this aspect is sublime in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull ha a touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defile the elephant s brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is a that great golden seal affixed by the german emperor to their decree it signifies god done this day by my hand but in most creature nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line few are the forehead which like shakespeare s or melancthon s rise so high and descend so low that the eye themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lake and all above them in the forehead s wrinkle you seem to track the antlered thought descending there to drink a the highland hunter track the snow print of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty god like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread power more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eye ear or mouth no face he ha none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddle dumbly lowering with the doom of boat and ship and men nor in profile doe this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed it grandeur doe not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semi crescentic depression in the forehead s middle which in man is lavater s mark of genius but how genius in the sperm whale ha the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their child magian thought they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale ha no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small a to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birth right the merry may day god of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to jove s high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphic but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man s and every being s face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty language could not read the simplest peasant s face in it profounder and more subtle meaning how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whale s brow i but put that brow before you read it if you can chapter the nut if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square in the full grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty foot in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is a the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base but in life a we have elsewhere seen this inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull form a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this crater in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inch in length and a many in depth repose the mere handful of this monster s brain the brain is at least twenty foot from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind it vast outwork like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortification of quebec so like a choice casket is it secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale ha any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic yard of his sperm magazine lying in strange fold course and convolution to their apprehension it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him a the seat of his intelligence it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creature s living intact state is an entire delusion a for his true brain you can then see no indication of it nor feel any the whale like all thing that are mighty wear a false brow to the common world if you unload his skull of it spermy heap and then take a rear view of it rear end which is the high end you will be struck by it resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of men s skull and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depression on one part of it summit in phrenological phrase you would say this man had no self esteem and no veneration and by those negation considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimension of the whale s proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you if you attentively regard almost any quadruped s spine you will be struck with the resemblance of it vertebr to a strung necklace of dwarfed skull all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebr are absolutely undeveloped skull but the curious external resemblance i take it the german were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebr of which he wa inlaying in a sort of basso relievo the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologist have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigation from the cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a man s character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine a in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck vertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inch across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards a it pass through the remaining vertebr the canal taper in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance the spinal cord a the brain and directly communicates with the brain and what is still more for many foot after emerging from the brain s cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain under all these circumstance would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale s spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate a it may with the phrenologist i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm whale s hump this august hump if i mistake not rise over one of the larger vertebr and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from it relative situation then i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know chapter the pequod meet the virgin the predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and german are now among the least but here and there at very wide interval of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respect while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain wa impelled towards u impatiently standing in the bow instead of the stern what ha he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something wavingly held by the german impossible a lamp feeder not that said stubb no no it s a coffee pot mr starbuck he s coming off to make u our coffee is the yarman don t you see that big tin can there alongside of him that s his boiling water oh he s all right is the yarman go along with you cried flask it s a lamp feeder and an oil can he s out of oil and ha come a begging however curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowing oil on the whale ground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coal to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp feeder a flask did declare a he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lamp feeder and oil can with some remark touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness his last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flying fish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship wa indeed what in the fishery is technically called a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin his necessity supplied derick departed but he had not gained his ship s side when whale were almost simultaneously raised from the mast head of both vessel and so eager for the chase wa derick that without pausing to put his oil can and lamp feeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp feeder now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boat that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequod s keel there were eight whale an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flank a closely a so many span of horse in harness they left a great wide wake a though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many fathom in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress a well a by the unusual yellowish incrustation overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathan to be at all social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the white bone or swell at his broad muzzle wa a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile current meet his spout wa short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shred followed by strange subterranean commotion in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the water behind him to upbubble who s got some paregoric said stubb he ha the stomach ache i m afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomach ache adverse wind are holding mad christmas in him boy it s the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be he s lost his tiller a an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horse careen buries roll and wallow on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib end expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say only wait a bit old chap and i ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whale line near him mind he don t sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the german will have him with one intent all the combined rival boat were pointed for this one fish because not only wa he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he wa nearest to them and the other whale were going with such great velocity moreover a almost to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the pequod s keel had shot by the three german boat last lowered but from the great start he had had derick s boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rival the only thing they feared wa that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pas him a for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp feeder at the other boat the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mock and dare me with the very poor box i filled for him not five minute ago then in his old intense whisper give way greyhound dog to it i tell ye what it is men cried stubb to his crew it s against my religion to get mad but i d like to eat that villainous yarman pull won t ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why don t some of ye burst a blood vessel who s that been dropping an anchor overboard we don t budge an inch we re becalmed halloo here s grass growing in the boat s bottom and by the lord the mast there s budding this won t do boy look at that yarman the short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not oh see the suds he make cried flask dancing up and down what a hump oh do pile on the beef lay like a log oh my lad do spring slap jack and quahog for supper you know my lad baked clam and muffin oh do do spring he s a hundred barreller don t lose him now don t oh don t see that yarman oh won t ye pull for your duff my lad such a sog such a sogger don t ye love sperm there go three thousand dollar men a bank a whole bank the bank of england oh do do do what s that yarman about now at this moment derick wa in the act of pitching his lamp feeder at the advancing boat and also his oil can perhaps with the double view of retarding his rival way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty thousand line of battle ship load of red haired devil what d ye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in two and twenty piece for the honor of old gayhead what d ye say i say pull like god dam cried the indian fiercely but evenly incited by the taunt of the german the pequod s three boat now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mate stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of there she slide now hurrah for the white ash breeze down with the yarman sail over him but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber wa striving to free his white ash and while in consequence derick s boat wa nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage that wa a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forward and slantingly ranged up on the german s quarter an instant more and all four boat were diagonically in the whale s immediate wake while stretching from them on both side wa the foaming swell that he made it wa a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale wa now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circle in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawk but the bird ha a voice and with plaintive cry will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea wa chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there wa enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moment more would give the pequod s boat the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tiger queequeg tashtego daggoo instinctively sprang to their foot and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barb and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket iron entered the whale blinding vapor of foam and white fire the three boat in the first fury of the whale s headlong rush bumped the german s aside with such force that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keel don t be afraid my butter box cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them a he shot by ye ll be picked up presently all right i saw some shark astern st bernard s dog you know relieve distressed traveller hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrah here we go like three tin kettle at the tail of a mad cougar this put me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain make the wheel spoke fly boy when you fasten to him that way and there s danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feel when he s going to davy jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carry the everlasting mail but the monster s run wa a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three line flew round the loggerhead with such a force a to gouge deep groove in them while so fearful were the harpooneer that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the line that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turn with the rope to hold on till at last owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead lined chock of the boat whence the three rope went straight down into the blue the gunwale of the bow were almost even with the water while the three stern tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position wa a little ticklish but though boat have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on a it is called this hooking up by the sharp barb of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torment the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foe yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stay under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whale something less than square foot the pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here above ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathom of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmosphere one whaleman ha estimated it at the weight of twenty line of battle ship with all their gun and store and men on board a the three boat lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into it eternal blue noon and a not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much a a ripple or a bubble came up from it depth what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the sea wa writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inch of perpendicular rope were visible at the bow seems it credible that by three such thin thread the great leviathan wa suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bit of board is this the creature of whom it wa once so triumphantly said canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron or his head with fish spear the sword of him that layeth at him can not hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron a straw the arrow can not make him flee dart are counted a stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophet for with the strength of a thousand thigh in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountain of the sea to hide him from the pequod s fish spear in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadow that the three boat sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantom flitting over his head stand by men he stir cried starbuck a the three line suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them a by magnetic wire the life and death throb of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bow the boat gave a sudden bounce upwards a a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bear are scared from it into the sea haul in haul in cried starbuck again he s rising the line of which hardly an instant before not one hand s breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coil flung back all dripping into the boat and soon the whale broke water within two ship s length of the hunter his motion plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animal there are certain valve or flood gate in many of their vein whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain direction not so with the whale one of whose peculiarity it is to have an entire non valvular structure of the blood vessel so that when pierced even by so small a point a a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant stream yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous it interior fountain that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even a in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the well spring of far off and undiscernible hill even now when the boat pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying fluke and the lance were darted into him they were followed by steady jet from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spout hole in his head wa only at interval however rapid sending it affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life a they significantly call it wa untouched a the boat now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged wa plainly revealed his eye or rather the place where his eye had been were beheld a strange misgrown mass gather in the knot hole of the noblest oak when prostrate so from the point which the whale s eye had once occupied now protruded blind bulb horribly pitiable to see but pity there wa none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eye he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridal and other merry making of men and also to illuminate the solemn church that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once avast cried starbuck there s no need of that but humane starbuck wa too late at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crew all over with shower of gore capsizing flask s boat and marring the bow it wa his death stroke for by this time so spent wa he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secret of his belly lay like a log and died it wa most piteous that last expiring spout a when by unseen hand the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with half stifled melancholy gurglings the spray column lower and lower to the ground so the last long dying spout of the whale soon while the crew were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptom of sinking with all it treasure unrifled immediately by starbuck s order line were secured to it at different point so that ere long every boat wa a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inch beneath them by the cord by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale wa transferred to her side and wa strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke chain for it wa plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon wa found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but a the stump of harpoon are frequently found in the dead body of captured whale with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must need have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious wa the fact of a lance head of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before america wa discovered what other marvel might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop wa put to further discovery by the ship s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the body s immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of affair hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arm with the body then when the command wa given to break clear from it such wa the immovable strain upon the timber head to which the fluke chain and cable were fastened that it wa impossible to cast them off meantime everything in the pequod wa aslant to cross to the other side of the deck wa like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwark and cabin were started from their place by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspike and crow were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke chain to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged end could not be at all approached while every moment whole ton of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over hold on hold on won t ye cried stubb to the body don t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspike and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cut the big chain knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter s heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest fluke chain but a few stroke full of spark were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing nor ha any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale float with great buoyancy with it side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the only whale that thus sank were old meagre and broken hearted creature their pad of lard diminished and all their bone heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whale in the highest health and swelling with noble aspiration prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant hero do sometimes sink be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other specie where one of that sort go down twenty right whale do this difference in the specie is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blind alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instance where after the lapse of many hour or several day the sunken whale again rise more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gas are generated in him he swell to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a line of battle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on sounding among the bay of new zealand when a right whale give token of sinking they fasten buoy to him with plenty of rope so that when the body ha gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again it wa not long after the sinking of the body that a cry wa heard from the pequod s mast head announcing that the jungfrau wa again lowering her boat though the only spout in sight wa that of a fin back belonging to the specie of uncapturable whale because of it incredible power of swimming nevertheless the fin back s spout is so similar to the sperm whale s that by unskilful fisherman it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keel and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase oh many are the fin back and many are the dericks my friend chapter the honor and glory of whaling there are some enterprise in which a careful disorderliness is the true method the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my research up to the very spring head of it so much the more am i impressed with it great honorableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many great demi god and hero prophet of all sort who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity the gallant perseus a son of jupiter wa the first whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood wa not killed with any sordid intent those were the knightly day of our profession when we only bore arm to succor the distressed and not to fill men s lamp feeder every one know the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king wa tied to a rock on the sea coast and a leviathan wa in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid it wa an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneer of the present day inasmuch a this leviathan wa slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temple there stood for many age the vast skeleton of a whale which the city s legend and all the inhabitant asserted to be the identical bone of the monster that perseus slew when the roman took joppa the same skeleton wa carried to italy in triumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it wa from joppa that jonah set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it is that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicle whale and dragon are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other thou art a a lion of the water and a a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some version of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale let not the modern painting of this scene mislead u for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin like shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those time when the true form of the whale wa unknown to artist and considering that a in perseus case st george s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or sea horse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draught of the scene to hold this so called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistine dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horse s head and both the palm of his hand fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good right we harpooneer of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knight of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frock and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st george s decoration than they whether to admit hercules among u or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythology that antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoicing good deed wa swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly make a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan but by the best contradictory authority this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice vers certainly they are very similar if i claim the demi god then why not the prophet nor do hero saint demigod and prophet alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal king of old time we find the head water of our fraternity in nothing short of the great god themselves that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which give u the dread vishnoo one of the three person in the godhead of the hindoo give u this divine vishnoo himself for our lord vishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnation ha for ever set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of god saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of it periodical dissolution he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the veda or mystical book whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hint to young architect these veda were lying at the bottom of the water so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depth rescued the sacred volume wa not this vishnoo a whaleman then even a a man who ride a horse is called a horseman perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo there s a member roll for you what club but the whaleman s can head off like that chapter jonah historically regarded reference wa made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greek and roman who standing out from the orthodox pagan of their time equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those tradition did not make those tradition one whit the less fact for all that one old sag harbor whaleman s chief reason for questioning the hebrew story wa this he had one of those quaint old fashioned bible embellished with curious unscientific plate one of which represented jonah s whale with two spout in his head a peculiarity only true with respect to a specie of the leviathan the right whale and the variety of that order concerning which the fisherman have this saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small but to this bishop jebb s anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hint the bishop that we consider jonah a tombed in the whale s belly but a temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whale s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist table and comfortably seat all the player possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thought the right whale is toothless another reason which sag harbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet wa something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale s gastric juice but this objection likewise fall to the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale even a the french soldier in the russian campaign turned their dead horse into tent and crawled into them besides it ha been divined by other continental commentator that when jonah wa thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figure head and i would add possibly called the whale a some craft are nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life preserver an inflated bag of wind which the endangered prophet swam to and so wa saved from a watery doom poor sag harbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for his want of faith it wa this if i remember right jonah wa swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three day he wa vomited up somewhere within three day journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three day journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that but wa there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three day not to speak of the tigris water near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in besides this idea of jonah s weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz it reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar but all these foolish argument of old sag harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea i say it only show his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah s going to nineveh via the cape of good hope wa advanced a a signal magnification of the general miracle and so it wa besides to this day the highly enlightened turk devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three century ago an english traveller in old harris s voyage speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in which mosque wa a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil chapter pitchpoling to make them run easily and swiftly the axle of carriage are anointed and for much the same purpose some whaler perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that a such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pain in that occupation crawling under it bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness a though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft s bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event towards noon whale were raised but so soon a the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight a of cleopatra s barge from actium nevertheless the boat pursued and stubb s wa foremost by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted straining upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boat up to his flank wa impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained of all the wondrous device and dexterity the sleight of hand and countless subtlety to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine man uvre with the lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all it exercise boast nothing like it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale it grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve foot in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter material pine it is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon a compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawback a a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling come into play look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergency wa specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling look at him he stand upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty foot ahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along it length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gather up the coil of the warp in one hand so a to secure it free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before his waistband s middle he level it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the butt end in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stand fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen foot in the air he mind you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel span the foaming distance and quiver in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spout red blood that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb ti july s immortal fourth all fountain must run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then tashtego lad i d have ye hold a canakin to the jet and we d drink round it yea verily heart alive we d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the living stuff again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to it master like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale go into his flurry the tow line is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern fold his hand and mutely watch the monster die chapter the fountain that for six thousand year and no one know how many million of age before the great whale should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mistifying the garden of the deep a with so many sprinkling or mistifying pot and that for some century back thousand of hunter should have been close by the fountain of the whale watching these sprinkling and spoutings that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minute past one o clock p m of this sixteenth day of december a d it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vapor this is surely a noteworthy thing let u then look at this matter along with some interesting item contingent every one know that by the peculiar cunning of their gill the finny tribe in general breathe the air which at all time is combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise it head above the surface but owing to his marked internal structure which give him regular lung like a human being s the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visit to the upper world but he can not in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm whale s mouth is buried at least eight foot beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe ha no connexion with his mouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head if i say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch a it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood it vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific word assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostril and not fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then live without breathing anomalous a it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically life by interval his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much a in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he ha no gill how is this between his rib and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli like vessel which vessel when he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand fathom in the sea he carry a surplus stock of vitality in him just a the camel crossing the waterless desert carry a surplus supply of drink for future use in it four supplementary stomach the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out a the fisherman phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested rising say he stay eleven minute and jet seventy time that is respires seventy breath then whenever he rise again he will be sure to have his seventy breath over again to a minute now if after he fetch a few breath you alarm him so that he sound he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breath are told will he finally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that in different individual these rate are different but in any one they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the whale s rising expose him to all the fatal hazard of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathom beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter a the great necessity that strike the victory to thee in man breathing is incessantly going on one breath only serving for two or three pulsation so that whatever other business he ha to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time it ha been said that the whale only breathes through his spout hole if it could truthfully be added that his spout are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answer to his nose is that identical spout hole and being so clogged with two element it could not be expected to have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the spout whether it be water or whether it be vapor no absolute certainty can a yet be arrived at on this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale ha no proper olfactories but what doe he want of them no rose no violet no cologne water in the sea furthermore a his windpipe solely open into the tube of his spouting canal and a that long canal like the grand erie canal is furnished with a sort of lock that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale ha no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumble he talk through his nose but then again what ha the whale to say seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended a it is for the conveyance of air and for several foot laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gas pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street but the question return whether this gas pipe is also a water pipe in other word whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it can not be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally take in water but the sperm whale s food is far beneath the surface and there he can not spout even if he would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the period of his jet and the ordinary period of respiration but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain thing i have ever found your plain thing the knottiest of all and a for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided a to what it is precisely the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water fall from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such time you should think that you really perceived drop of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from it vapor or how do you know that they are not those identical drop superficially lodged in the spout hole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whale s head for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid day sea in a calm with his elevated hump sun dried a a dromedary s in the desert even then the whale always carry a small basin of water on his head a under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it you can not go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapory shred of the jet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise i can not say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eye it will blind you the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even if we can not prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reason to this conclusion i am impelled by consideration touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch a it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on sounding or near shore all other whale sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from the head of all ponderous profound being such a plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always go up a certain semi visible steam while in the act of thinking deep thought while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cup of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition and how nobly it raise our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplation and that vapor a you will sometimes see it glorified by a rainbow a if heaven itself had put it seal upon his thought for d ye see rainbow do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapor and so through all the thick mist of the dim doubt in my mind divine intuition now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubt many deny but doubt or denial few along with them have intuition doubt of all thing earthly and intuition of some thing heavenly this combination make neither believer nor infidel but make a man who regard them both with equal eye chapter the tail other poet have warbled the praise of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i celebrate a tail reckoning the largest sized sperm whale s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it taper to about the girth of a man it comprises upon it upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square foot the compact round body of it root expands into two broad firm flat palm or fluke gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junction these fluke slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wing leaving a wide vacancy between in no living thing are the line of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic border of these fluke at it utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty foot across the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinew but cut into it and you find that three distinct stratum compose it upper middle and lower the fibre in the upper and lower layer are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layer this triune structure a much a anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman wall the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tile always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relic of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry but a if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibre and filament which passing on either side the loin and running down into the fluke insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it nor doe this it amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of it motion where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power on the contrary those motion derive their most appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength ha much to do with the magic take away the tied tendon that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and it charm would be gone a devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe he wa overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed a a roman triumphal arch when angelo paint even god the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian picture in which his idea ha been most successfully embodied these picture so destitute a they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hand it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtue of his teaching such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in it flexion are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no fairy s arm can transcend it five great motion are peculiar to it first when used a a fin for progression second when used a a mace in battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking fluke first being horizontal in it position the leviathan s tail act in a different manner from the tail of all other sea creature it never wriggle in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail is the sole mean of propulsion scroll wise coiled forward beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which give that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his side fin only serve to steer by second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fight another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflict with man he chiefly and contemptuously us his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curve away his fluke from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend to it mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no rib of man or boat can withstand it your only salvation lie in eluding it but if it come sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of it material a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result these submerged side blow are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere child s play some one strip off a frock and the hole is stopped third i can not demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant s trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness move his immense fluke from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailor s whisker woe to that sailor whisker and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flower market and with low salutation presented nosegay to damsel and then caressed their zone on more account than one a pity it is that the whale doe not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary sea you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kitten like he play on the ocean a if it were a hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palm of his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for mile you would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that wa the smoke from the touch hole fifth a in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the fluke lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deep his entire fluke with at least thirty foot of his body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breach somewhere else to be described this peaking of the whale s fluke is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundity the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven so in dream have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in gazing at such scene it is all in all what mood you are in if in the dantean the devil will occur to you if in that of isaiah the archangel standing at the mast head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whale in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked fluke a it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the god wa never beheld even in persia the home of the fire worshipper a ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all being for according to king juba the military elephant of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunk uplifted in the profoundest silence the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far a some aspect of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organ on an equality much less the creature to which they respectively belong for a the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared with leviathan s tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephant s trunk were a the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale s ponderous fluke which in repeated instance have one after the other hurled entire boat with all their oar and crew into the air very much a an indian juggler toss his ball though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch a in that particular the elephant stand in much the same respect to the whale that a dog doe to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some point of curious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability to express it at time there are gesture in it which though they would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gesture that i have heard hunter who have declared them akin to free mason sign and symbol that the whale indeed by these method intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other motion of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he ha none thou shalt see my back part my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i can not completely make out his back part and hint what he will about his face i say again he ha no face chapter the grand armada the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending south eastward from the territory of birmah form the most southerly point of all asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long island of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelago this rampart is pierced by several sally port for the convenience of ship and whale conspicuous among which are the strait of sunda and malacca by the strait of sunda chiefly vessel bound to china from the west emerge into the china sea those narrow strait of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing midway in that vast rampart of island buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seaman a java head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spice and silk and jewel and gold and ivory with which the thousand island of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such treasure by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the all grasping western world the shore of the strait of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortress which guard the entrance to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the dane these oriental do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top sail from the endless procession of ship before the wind which for century past by night and by day have passed between the island of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargo of the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no mean renounce their claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas of the malay lurking among the low shaded cove and islet of sumatra have sallied out upon the vessel sailing through the strait fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spear though by the repeated bloody chastisement they have received at the hand of european cruiser the audacity of these corsair ha of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessel which in those water have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair fresh wind the pequod wa now drawing nigh to these strait ahab purposing to pas through them into the javan sea and thence cruising northward over water known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine island and gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there by these mean the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising ground of the world previous to descending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he wa most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it but how now in this zoned quest doe ahab touch no land doe his crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now the circus running sun ha raced within his fiery ring and need no sustenance but what s in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while other hull are loaded down

hold she is ballasted with utility not altogether with unusable pig lead and kentledge she carry year water in her clear old prime nantucket water which when three year afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in cask from the peruvian or indian stream hence it is that while other ship may have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score of port the whale ship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seaman like themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answer well boy here s the ark now a many sperm whale had been captured off the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the strait of sunda indeed a most of the ground roundabout wa generally recognised by the fisherman a an excellent spot for cruising therefore a the pequod gained more and more upon java head the look out were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliff of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostril the fresh cinnamon wa snuffed in the air yet not a single jet wa descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the strait when the customary cheering cry wa heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted u but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four ocean the sperm whale instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached company a in former time are now frequently met with in extensive herd sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem a if numerous nation of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravan may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising ground you may now sometimes sail for week and month together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousand on thousand broad on both bow at the distance of some two or three mile and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whale jet were up playing and sparkling in the noon day air unlike the straight perpendicular twin jet of the right whale which dividing at top fall over in two branch like the cleft drooping bough of a willow the single forward slanting spout of the sperm whale present a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward seen from the pequod s deck then a she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapory spout individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimney of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height a marching army approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountain accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whale now seem hurrying forward through the strait gradually contracting the wing of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneer handling their weapon and loudly cheering from the head of their yet suspended boat if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these strait of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental sea to witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped white elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with stun sail piled on stun sail we sailed along driving these leviathan before u when of a sudden the voice of tashtego wa heard loudly directing attention to something in our wake corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of detached white vapor rising and falling something like the spout of the whale only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivot hole cry aloft there and rig whip and bucket to wet the sail malay sir and after u a if too long lurking behind the headland till the pequod should fairly have entered the strait these rascally asiatic were now in hot pursuit to make up for their over cautious delay but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind wa herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropist to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit mere riding whip and rowel to her that they were a with glass under arm ahab to and fro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monster he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirate chasing him some such fancy a the above seemed his and when he glanced upon the green wall of the watery defile in which the ship wa then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same gate he wa now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirate and inhuman atheistical devil were infernally cheering him on with their curse when all these conceit had passed through his brain ahab s brow wa left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide ha been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from it place but thought like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirate astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad water beyond then the harpooneer seemed more to grieve that the swift whale had been gaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malay but still driving on in the wake of the whale at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word wa passed to spring to the boat but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notified of the three keel that were after them though a yet a mile in their rear than they rallied again and forming in close rank and battalion so that their spout all looked like flashing line of stacked bayonet moved on with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirt and drawer we sprang to the white ash and after several hour pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing commotion among the whale gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fisherman perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial column in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephant in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation in all direction expanding in vast irregular circle and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this wa still more strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed a it were helplessly floated like water logged dismantled ship on the sea had these leviathan been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolf they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creature though banding together in ten of thousand the lion maned buffalo of the west have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human being how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre s pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helter skelter for the outlet crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whale before u for there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men though many of the whale a ha been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that a a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place a is customary in those case the boat at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirt of the shoal in about three minute time queequeg s harpoon wa flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our face and then running away with u like light steered straight for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstance is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet doe it present one of the more perilous vicissitude of the fishery for a the swift monster drag you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb a blind and deaf the whale plunged forward a if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him a we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all side menaced a we flew by the crazed creature to and fro rushing about u our beset boat wa like a ship mobbed by ice isle in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channel and strait knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed but not a bit daunted queequeg steered u manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal fluke were suspended overhead while all the time starbuck stood up in the bow lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whale he could reach by short dart for there wa no time to make long one nor were the oarsman quite idle though their wonted duty wa now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp u hard down with your tail there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan like extremity all whaleboat carry certain curious contrivance originally invented by the nantucket indian called druggs two thick square of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each other s grain at right angle a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly among gallied whale that this drugg is used for then more whale are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm whale are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and if you can not kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at time like these the drugg come into requisition our boat wa furnished with three of them the first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whale staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like malefactor with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seat of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boat s bottom a the seat slid from under him on both side the sea came in at the wounded plank but we stuffed two or three drawer and shirt in and so stopped the leak for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged harpoon were it not that a we advanced into the herd our whale s way greatly diminished moreover that a we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorder seemed waning so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whale into the innermost heart of the shoal a if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storm in the roaring glen between the outermost whale were heard but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin like surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet mood yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumult of the outer concentric circle and saw successive pod of whale eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied span of horse in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circus rider might easily have over arched the middle one and so have gone round on their back owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whale more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape wa at present afforded u we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed u in the wall that had only admitted u in order to shut u up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cow and calf the woman and child of this routed host now inclusive of the occasional wide interval between the revolving outer circle and inclusive of the space between the various pod in any one of those circle the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square mile at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this circumstance because a if the cow and calf had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and a if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of it stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whale now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which it wa impossible not to marvel at like household dog they came snuffling round u right up to our gunwale and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their forehead starbuck scratched their back with his lance but fearful of the consequence for the time refrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eye a we gazed over the side for suspended in those watery vault floated the form of the nursing mother of the whale and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mother the lake a i have hinted wa to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and a human infant while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast a if leading two different life at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence even so did the young of these whale seem looking up towards u but not at u a if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new born sight floating on their side the mother also seemed quietly eyeing u one of these little infant that from certain queer token seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen foot in length and some six foot in girth he wa a little frisky though a yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lie bent like a tartar s bow the delicate side fin and the palm of his fluke still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby s ear newly arrived from foreign part line line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him fast who line him who struck two whale one big one little what ail ye man cried starbuck look e here said queequeg pointing down a when the stricken whale that from the tub ha reeled out hundred of fathom of rope a after deep sounding he float up again and show the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now starbuck saw long coil of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to it dam not seldom in the rapid vicissitude of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secret of the sea seemed divulged to u in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan amour in the deep the sperm whale a with all other specie of the leviathan but unlike most other fish breed indifferently at all season after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine month producing but one at a time though in some few known instance giving birth to an esau and jacob a contingency provided for in suckling by two teat curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the breast themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious part in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter s lance the mother s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rod the milk is very sweet and rich it ha been tasted by man it might do well with strawberry when overflowing with mutual esteem the whale salute more hominum and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternation and affright did these inscrutable creature at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planet of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy meanwhile a we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacle in the distance evinced the activity of the other boat still engaged in drugging the whale on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreat were afforded them but the sight of the enraged drugged whale now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circle wa nothing to what at last met our eye it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him a it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail tendon it is done by darting a short handled cutting spade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again a whale wounded a we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually a it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he wa now dashing among the revolving circle like the lone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went but agonizing a wa the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd wa owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from u but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accident of the fishery this whale had become entangled in the harpoon line that he towed he had also run away with the cutting spade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coil of the harpoon line round his tail the cutting spade itself had worked loose from his flesh so that tormented to madness he wa now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrade this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright first the whale forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other a if lifted by half spent billow from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridal chamber and nursery vanished in more and more contracting orbit the whale in the more central circle began to swim in thickening cluster yes the long calm wa departing a low advancing hum wa soon heard and then like to the tumultuous mass of block ice when the great river hudson break up in spring the entire host of whale came tumbling upon their inner centre a if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck and queequeg changed place starbuck taking the stern oar oar he intensely whispered seizing the helm gripe your oar and clutch your soul now my god men stand by shove him off you queequeg the whale there prick him hit him stand up stand up and stay so spring men pull men never mind their back scrape them scrape away the boat wa now all but jammed between two vast black bulk leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long length but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hair breadth escape we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circle but now crossed by random whale all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation wa cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg s hat who while standing in the bow to prick the fugitive whale had his hat taken clean from his head by the air eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad fluke close by riotous and disordered a the universal commotion now wa it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit wa useless but the boat still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whale might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark it place on the sea and also a token of prior possession should the boat of any other ship draw near the result of this lowering wa somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fishery the more whale the less fish of all the drugged whale only one wa captured the rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken a will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the pequod chapter school and schoolmaster the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whale and there wa also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregation now though such great body are at time encountered yet a must have been seen even at the present day small detached band are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individual each such band are known a school they generally are of two sort those composed almost entirely of female and those mustering none but young vigorous male or bull a they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school of female you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his lady in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solace and endearment of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and his concubine is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportion the lady even at full growth are not more than one third of the bulk of an average sized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen yard round the waist nevertheless it can not be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point it is very curious to watch this harem and it lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern sea and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental water in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year when serenely advancing on one of these journey if any strange suspicious sight are seen my lord whale keep a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the lady with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chase him away high time indeed if unprincipled young rake like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he can not keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for ala all fish bed in common a ashore the lady often cause the most terrible duel among their rival admirer just so with the whale who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with their long lower jaw sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elk that warringly interweave their antler not a few are captured having the deep scar of these encounter furrowed head broken teeth scolloped fin and in some instance wrenched and dislocated mouth but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem s lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revel there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubine granting other whale to be in sight the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these grand turk for these grand turk are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small a for the son and the daughter they beget why those son and daughter must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lover that might be named my lord whale ha no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaf his anonymous baby all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless a the ardour of youth decline a year and dump increase a reflection lends her solemn pause in short a a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maiden our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul go about all alone among the meridian and parallel saying his prayer and warning each young leviathan from his amorous error now a the harem of whale is called by the fisherman a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known a the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoir of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a country schoolmaster that famous frenchman wa in his younger day and what wa the nature of those occult lesson he inculcated into some of his pupil the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing year is true of all aged sperm whale almost universally a lone whale a a solitary leviathan is called prof an ancient one like venerable moss bearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he take to wife in the wilderness of water and the best of wife she is though she keep so many moody secret the school composing none but young and vigorous male previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem school for while those female whale are characteristically timid the young male or forty barrel bull a they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathan and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous grey headed grizzled whale sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiend exasperated by a penal gout the forty barrel bull school are larger than the harem school like a mob of young collegian they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about three fourth grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlement that is harem another point of difference between the male and female school is still more characteristic of the sex say you strike a forty barrel bull poor devil all his comrade quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companion swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long a themselves to fall a prey chapter fast fish and loose fish the allusion to the waif and waif pole in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the law and regulation of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge it frequently happens that when several ship are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingency all partaking of this one grand feature for example after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tow it alongside without risk of life or line thus the most vexatious and violent dispute would often arise between the fisherman were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all case perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment wa that of holland it wa decreed by the state general in a d but though no other nation ha ever had any written whaling law yet the american fisherman have been their own legislator and lawyer in this matter they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian s pandects and the by law of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people s business yes these law might be engraven on a queen anne s farthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they i a fast fish belongs to the party fast to it ii a loose fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it but what play the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentary to expound it first what is a fast fish alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupant a mast an oar a nine inch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same likewise a fish is technically fast when it bear a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long a the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside a well a their intention so to do these are scientific commentary but the commentary of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard word and harder knock the coke upon littleton of the fist true among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowance are always made for peculiar case where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others are by no mean so scrupulous some fifty year ago there wa a curious case of whale trover litigated in england wherein the plaintiff set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern sea and when indeed they the plaintiff had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their life obliged to forsake not only their line but their boat itself ultimately the defendant the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eye of the plaintiff and when those defendant were remonstrated with their captain snapped his finger in the plaintiff teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoon and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the plaintiff now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoon and boat mr erskine wa counsel for the defendant lord ellenborough wa the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wife s viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the sea of life but in the course of year repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her erskine wa on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loose fish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re harpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentleman s property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case erskine contended that the example of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other these pleading and the counter pleading being duly heard the very learned judge in set term decided to wit that a for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiff because they had merely abandoned it to save their life but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoon and line they belonged to the defendant the whale because it wa a loose fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoon and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish acquired a property in those article and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them now the defendant afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid article were theirs a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principle laid down in the twin whaling law previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two law touching fast fish and loose fish i say will on reflection be found the fundamental of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding it complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistine ha but two prop to stand on is it not a saying in every one s mouth possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the sinew and soul of russian serf and republican slave but fast fish whereof possession is the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widow s last mite but a fast fish what is yonder undetected villain s marble mansion with a door plate for a waif what is that but a fast fish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker get from poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone s family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fast fish what is the archbishop of savesoul s income of seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundred of thousand of broken backed laborer all sure of heaven without any of savesoul s help what is that globular but a fast fish what are the duke of dunder s hereditary town and hamlet but fast fish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fast fish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fast fish and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law but if the doctrine of fast fish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of loose fish is still more widely so that is internationally and universally applicable what wa america in but a loose fish in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress what wa poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india to england what at last will mexico be to the united state all loose fish what are the right of man and the liberty of the world but loose fish what all men s mind and opinion but loose fish what is the principle of religious belief in them but a loose fish what to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thought of thinker but loose fish what is the great globe itself but a loose fish and what are you reader but a loose fish and a fast fish too chapter head or tail de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam bracton l c latin from the book of the law of england which taken along with the context mean that of all whale captured by anybody on the coast of that land the king a honorary grand harpooneer must have the head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder now a this law under a modified form is to this day in force in england and a it offer in various respect a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose fish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompt the english railway to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in curious proof of the fact that the above mentioned law is still in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two year it seems that some honest mariner of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque port had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore now the cinque port are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden holding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal emolument incident to the cinque port territory become by assignment his by some writer this office is called a sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at time in fobbing his perquisite which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them now when these poor sun burnt mariner bare footed and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely leg had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry promising themselves a good from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wife and good ale with their crony upon the strength of their respective share up step a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whale s head he say hand off this fish my master is a fast fish i seize it a the lord warden s upon this the poor mariner in their respectful consternation so truly english knowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their head all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for his idea made bold to speak please sir who is the lord warden the duke but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish it is his we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the duke s benefit we getting nothing at all for our pain but our blister it is his is the duke so very poor a to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood it is his i thought to relieve my old bed ridden mother by part of my share of this whale it is his won t the duke be content with a quarter or a half it is his in a word the whale wa seized and sold and his grace the duke of wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular light the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstance a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariner into full consideration to which my lord duke in substance replied both letter were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other people s business is this the still militant old man standing at the corner of the three kingdom on all hand coercing alms of beggar it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale wa a delegated one from the sovereign we must need inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right the law itself ha already been set forth but plowdon give u the reason for it say plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen because of it superior excellence and by the soundest commentator this ha ever been held a cogent argument in such matter but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason for that ye lawyer in his treatise on queen gold or queen pinmoney an old king s bench author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queen s that ye queen s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this wa written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale wa largely used in lady bodice but this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writer the whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitation and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown s ordinary revenue i know not that any other author ha hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way a the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all thing even in law chapter the pequod meet the rose bud in vain it wa to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry sir t browne v e it wa a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory mid day sea that the many nose on the pequod s deck proved more vigilant discoverer than the three pair of eye aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell wa smelt in the sea i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whale we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long presently the vapor in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sail betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside a we glided nearer the stranger showed french colour from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea fowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it wa plain that the whale alongside must be what the fisherman call a blasted whale that is a whale that ha died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subject is of a very inferior quality and by no mean of the nature of attar of rose coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whale that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct body almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale a this however much he may shun blasted whale in general the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade pole entangled in the line that were knotted round the tail of one of these whale there s a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ship s bow there s a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchman are but poor devil in the fishery sometimes lowering their boat for breaker mistaking them for sperm whale spout yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of box of tallow candle and case of snuffer foreseeing that all the oil they will get won t be enough to dip the captain s wick into aye we all know these thing but look ye here s a crappo that is content with our leaving the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bone of that other precious fish he ha there poor devil i say pas round a hat some one and let s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity s sake for what oil he ll get from that drugged whale there wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and a for the other whale why i ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three mast of ours than he ll get from that bundle of bone though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man ha thought of that it s worth trying yes i m for it and so saying he started for the quarter deck by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod wa now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by it breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boat s crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stem piece wa carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk wa painted green and for thorn had copper spike projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head board in large gilt letter he read bouton de rose rose button or rose bud and this wa the romantic name of this aromatic ship though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet the word rose and the bulbous figure head put together sufficiently explained the whole to him a wooden rose bud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smell now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bow to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawled bouton de rose ahoy are there any of you bouton de rose that speak english yes rejoined a guernsey man from the bulwark who turned out to be the chief mate well then my bouton de rose bud have you seen the white whale what whale the white whale a sperm whale moby dick have ye seen him never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale no very good then good bye now and i ll call again in a minute then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter deck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hand into a trumpet and shouted no sir no upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernsey man who had just got into the chain and wa using a cutting spade had slung his nose in a sort of bag what s the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it i wish it wa broken or that i didn t have any nose at all answered the guernsey man who did not seem to relish the job he wa at very much but what are you holding yours for oh nothing it s a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day ain t it air rather gardenny i should say throw u a bunch of posy will ye bouton de rose what in the devil s name do you want here roared the guernseyman flying into a sudden passion oh keep cool cool yes that s the word why don t you pack those whale in ice while you re working at em but joking aside though do you know rose bud that it s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whale a for that dried up one there he hasn t a gill in his whole carcase i know that well enough but d ye see the captain here won t believe it this is his first voyage he wa a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap he ll believe you if he won t me and so i ll get out of this dirty scrape anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the sailor in tasselled cap of red worsted were getting the heavy tackle in readiness for the whale but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their nose upwardly projected from their face like so many jib boom now and then pair of them would drop their work and run up to the mast head to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coal tar and at interval held it to their nostril others having broken the stem of their pipe almost short off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobacco smoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories stubb wa struck by a shower of outcry and anathema proceeding from the captain s round house abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which wa held ajar from within this wa the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceeding of the day had betaken himself to the captain s round house cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaty and indignation at time marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernsey man had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain a a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernsey man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise wa quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernsey man under cover of an interpreter s office wa to tell the captain what he pleased but a coming from stubb and a for stubb he wa to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he wa a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a sea captain with large whisker and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch seal at his side to this gentleman stubb wa now politely introduced by the guernsey man who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them what shall i say to him first said he why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seal you may a well begin by telling him that he look a sort of babyish to me though i don t pretend to be a judge he say monsieur said the guernsey man in french turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chief mate with six sailor had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more what now said the guernsey man to stubb why since he take it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully i m quite certain that he s no more fit to command a whale ship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me he s a baboon he vow and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures u a we value our life to cut loose from these fish instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting tackle and at once cast loose the cable and chain confining the whale to the ship what now said the guernsey man when the captain had returned to them why let me see yes you may a well tell him now that that in fact tell him i ve diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else he say monsieur that he s very happy to have been of any service to u hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful party meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux he want you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter thank him heartily but tell him it s against my principle to drink with the man i ve diddled in fact tell him i must go he say monsieur that his principle won t admit of his drinking but that if monsieur want to live another day to drink then monsieur had best drop all four boat and pull the ship away from these whale for it s so calm they won t drift by this time stubb wa over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernsey man to this effect that having a long tow line in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship s side while the frenchman s boat then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow line presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boat the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubb s whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intention at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boat spade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he wa digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt rib it wa like turning up old roman tile and pottery buried in fat english loam his boat s crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking a anxious a gold hunter and all the time numberless fowl were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb wa beginning to look disappointed especially a the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smell without being absorbed by it a one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean region a purse a purse dropping his spade he thrust both hand in and drew out handful of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good friend is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handful were obtained but more wa unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab s loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye chapter ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important a an article of commerce that in a certain nantucket born captain coffin wa examined at the bar of the english house of common on that subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substance are quite distinct for amber though at time found on the sea coast is also dug up in some far inland soil whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth piece to pipe for bead and ornament but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candle hair powder and pomatum the turk use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peter s in rome some wine merchant drop a few grain into claret to flavor it who would think then that such fine lady and gentleman should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowel of a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat load of brandreth s pill and then running out of harm s way a laborer do in blasting rock i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plate which at first stubb thought might be sailor trowsers button but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than piece of small squid bone embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthian about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all thing of ill savor cologne water in it rudimental manufacturing stage is the worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but can not owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased mind might be considered a indirectly substantiated by what ha been said of the frenchman s two whale elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion ha been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that all whale always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ship in london more than two century ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea a the southern ship have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bit thrust it through the bung hole of large cask and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy sea and the sudden and violent storm to which they are exposed forbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemetery in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave yard for the foundation of a lying in hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whaler may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former time of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smell a text book on that subject a it name import smeer fat berg to put up this village wa founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it wa a collection of furnace fat kettle and oil shed and when the work were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four year perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil doe not perhaps consume fifty day in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whale a a specie are by no mean creature of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised a the people of the middle age affected to detect a jew in the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when a a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of door though it is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm whale s fluke above water dispenses a perfume a when a musk scented lady rustle her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusk and redolent with myrrh which wa led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great chapter the castaway it wa but some few day after encountering the frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod s crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own now in the whale ship it is not every one that go in the boat some few hand are reserved called ship keeper whose province it is to work the vessel while the boat are pursuing the whale a a general thing these ship keeper are a hardy fellow a the men comprising the boat crew but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a ship keeper it wa so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick name pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy jolly in outer aspect pip and dough boy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal development though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span but while hapless dough boy wa by nature dull and torpid in his intellect pip though over tender hearted wa at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holiday and festivity with finer freer relish than any other race for black the year s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty five fourth of july and new year s day nor smile so while i write that this little black wa brilliant for even blackness ha it brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in king s cabinet but pip loved life and all life s peaceable security so that the panic striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though a ere long will be seen what wa thus temporarily subdued in him in the end wa destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fire that fictitiously showed him off to ten time the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddler s frolic on the green and at melodious even tide with his gay ha ha had turned the round horizon into one star belled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blue veined neck the pure watered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in it most impressive lustre he lay it against a gloomy ground and then light it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gas then come out those fiery effulgence infernally superb then the evil blazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal sky look like some crown jewel stolen from the king of hell but let u to the story it came to pas that in the ambergris affair stubb s after oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand a for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip wa put into his place the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and a the fish received the darted iron it gave it customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pip s seat the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so a to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chock of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turn around his chest and neck tashtego stood in the bow he wa full of the fire of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boat knife from it sheath he suspended it sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pip s blue choked face plainly looked do for god s sake all passed in a flash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale wa lost and pip wa saved so soon a he recovered himself the poor little negro wa assailed by yell and execration from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain business like but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance wa never jump from a boat pip except but all the rest wa indefinite a the soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your true motto in whaling but case will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better moreover a if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord i won t pick you up if you jump mind that we can t afford to lose whale by the like of you a whale would sell for thirty time what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and don t jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a money making animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hand of the god and pip jumped again it wa under very similar circumstance to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip wa left behind on the sea like a hurried traveller s trunk ala stubb wa but too true to his word it wa a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like gold beater s skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pip s ebon head showed like a head of clove no boat knife wa lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubb s inexorable back wa turned upon him and the whale wa winged in three minute a whole mile of shoreless ocean wa between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is a easy to the practised swimmer a to ride in a spring carriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how when sailor in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her side but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boat in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such consideration towards oarsman jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunter in all similar instance and such instance not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navy and army but it so happened that those boat without seeing pip suddenly spying whale close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubb s boat wa now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that pip s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he wa the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather carried down alive to wondrous depth where strange shape of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eye and the miser merman wisdom revealed his hoarded heap and among the joyous heartless ever juvenile eternity pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insect that out of the firmament of water heaved the colossal orb he saw god s foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmate called him mad so man s insanity is heaven s sense and wandering from all mortal reason man come at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feel then uncompromised indifferent a his god for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself chapter a squeeze of the hand that whale of stubb s so dearly purchased wa duly brought to the pequod s side where all those cutting and hoisting operation previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tub so soon a filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm wa carefully manipulated ere going to the try work of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantine s bath of it i found it strangely concreted into lump here and there rolling about in the liquid part it wa our business to squeeze these lump back into fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old time this sperm wa such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hand in it for only a few minute my finger felt like eel and began a it were to serpentine and spiralise a i sat there at my ease cross legged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along a i bathed my hand among those soft gentle globule of infiltrated tissue woven almost within the hour a they richly broke to my finger and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grape their wine a i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma literally and truly like the smell of spring violet i declare to you that for the time i lived a in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hand and my heart of it i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all ill will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co laborer hand in it mistaking their hand for the gentle globule such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i wa continually squeezing their hand and looking up into their eye sentimentally a much a to say oh my dear fellow being why should we longer cherish any social acerbity or know the slightest ill humor or envy come let u squeeze hand all round nay let u all squeeze ourselves into each other let u squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experience i have perceived that in all case man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thought of the vision of the night i saw long row of angel in paradise each with his hand in a jar of spermaceti now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other thing akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try work first come white horse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portion of his fluke it is tough with congealed tendon a wad of muscle but still contains some oil after being severed from the whale the white horse is first cut into portable oblong ere going to the mincer they look much like block of berkshire marble plum pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary part of the whale s flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in it unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold a it name import it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spot of the deepest crimson and purple it is plum of ruby in picture of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something a i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyard of champagne there is another substance and a very singular one which turn up in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tub of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membrane of the case coalescing gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fisherman it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale and much of which cover the deck of those inferior soul who hunt that ignoble leviathan nipper strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale s vocabulary but a applied by whalemen it becomes so a whaleman s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathan s tail it average an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishment a of magic allure along with it all impurity but to learn all about these recondite matter your best way is at once to descend into the blubber room and have a long talk with it inmate this place ha previously been mentioned a the receptacle for the blanket piece when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up it content this apartment is a scene of terror to all tiro especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space ha been left clear for the workman they generally go in pair a pike and gaffman and a spade man the whaling pike is similar to a frigate s boarding weapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boat hook with his gaff the gaffman hook on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping a the ship pitch and lurch about meanwhile the spade man stand on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse piece this spade is sharp a hone can make it the spademan s foot are shoeless the thing he stand on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cut off one of his own toe or one of his assistant would you be very much astonished toe are scarce among veteran blubber room men chapter the cassock had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this post mortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scupper not the wondrous cistern in the whale s huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you a half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone longer than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet black a yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or rather in old time it likeness wa such an idol a that found in the secret grove of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron a darkly set forth in the th chapter of the first book of king look at the sailor called the mincer who now come along and assisted by two ally heavily back the grandissimus a the mariner call it and with bowed shoulder stagger off with it a if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove it dark pelt a an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turn the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg give it a good stretching so a almost to double it diameter and at last hang it well spread in the rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three foot of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slit for arm hole at the other end he lengthwise slip himself bodily into it the mincer now stand before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar function of his office that office consists in mincing the horse piece of blubber for the pot an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwark and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced piece drop fast a the sheet from a rapt orator s desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaf what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer bible leaf bible leaf this is the invariable cry from the mate to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into a thin slice a possible inasmuch a by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and it quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality chapter the try work besides her hoisted boat an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try work she present the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship it is a if from the open field a brick kiln were transported to her plank the try work are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck the timber beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten foot by eight square and five in height the foundation doe not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knee of iron bracing it on all side and screwing it down to the timber on the flank it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great try pot two in number and each of several barrel capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punch bowl during the night watch some cynical old sailor will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing them one man in each pot side by side many confidential communication are carried on over the iron lip it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation it wa in the left hand try pot of the pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me that i wa first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all body gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time removing the fire board from the front of the try work the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouth of the furnace directly underneath the pot these mouth are fitted with heavy door of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by mean of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the work by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water a fast a it evaporates there are no external chimney they open direct from the rear wall and here let u go back for a moment it wa about nine o clock at night that the pequod s try work were first started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee the business all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the work this wa an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shaving into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try work ha to be fed for a time with wood after that no wood is used except a a mean of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scrap or fritter still contains considerable of it unctuous property these fritter feed the flame like a plethoric burning martyr or a self consuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supply his own fuel and burn by his own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time it ha an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such a may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyre it smell like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit by midnight the work were in full operation we were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind wa freshening the wild ocean darkness wa intense but that darkness wa licked up by the fierce flame which at interval forked forth from the sooty flue and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging a with the famed greek fire the burning ship drove on a if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur freighted brig of the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbor with broad sheet of flame for sail bore down upon the turkish frigate and folded them in conflagration the hatch removed from the top of the work now afforded a wide hearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shape of the pagan harpooneer always the whale ship s stoker with huge pronged pole they pitched hissing mass of blubber into the scalding pot or stirred up the fire beneath till the snaky flame darted curling out of the door to catch them by the foot the smoke rolled away in sullen heap to every pitch of the ship there wa a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their face opposite the mouth of the work on the further side of the wide wooden hearth wa the windlass this served for a sea sofa here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eye felt scorched in their head their tawny feature now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beard and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the work a they narrated to each other their unholy adventure their tale of terror told in word of mirth a their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flame from the furnace a to and fro in their front the harpooneer wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged fork and dipper a the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all side then the rushing pequod freighted with savage and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander s soul so seemed it to me a i stood at her helm and for long hour silently guided the way of this fire ship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shape before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred vision in my soul so soon a i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i wa horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jaw bone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ear wa the low hum of sail just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eye were open i wa half conscious of putting my finger to the lid and mechanically stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flash of redness uppermost wa the impression that whatever swift rushing thing i stood on wa not so much bound to any haven ahead a rushing from all haven astern a stark bewildered feeling a of death came over me convulsively my hand grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller wa somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and wa fronting the ship s stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when it redness make all thing look ghastly to morrow in the natural sun the sky will be bright those who glared like devil in the forking flame the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lamp all others but liar nevertheless the sun hide not virginia s dismal swamp nor rome s accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the million of mile of desert and of grief beneath the moon the sun hide not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two third of this earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal man can not be true not true or undeveloped with book the same the truest of all men wa the man of sorrow and the truest of all book is solomon s and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomon s wisdom yet but he who dodge hospital and jail and walk fast crossing graveyard and would rather talk of opera than hell call cowper young pascal rousseau poor devil all of sick men and throughout a care free lifetime swears by rabelais a passing wise and therefore jolly not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb stone and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon but even solomon he say the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain i e even while living in the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee a for the time it did me there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill eagle in some soul that can alike dive down into the blackest gorge and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny space and even if he for ever fly within the gorge that gorge is in the mountain so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other bird upon the plain even though they soar chapter the lamp had you descended from the pequod s try work to the pequod s forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized king and counsellor there they lay in their triangular oaken vault each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamp flashing upon his hooded eye in merchantman oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queen to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman a he seek the food of light so he life in light he make his berth an aladdin s lamp and lay him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ship s black hull still house an illumination see with what entire freedom the whaleman take his handful of lamp often but old bottle and vial though to the copper cooler at the try work and replenishes them there a mug of ale at a vat he burn too the purest of oil in it unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivance ashore it is sweet a early grass butter in april he go and hunt for his oil so a to be sure of it freshness and genuineness even a the traveller on the prairie hunt up his own supper of game chapter stowing down and clearing up already ha it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast head how he is chased over the watery moor and slaughtered in the valley of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garment in which the beheaded wa killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pot and like shadrach meshach and abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pas unscathed through the fire but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing singing if i may the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the cask and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan return to his native profundity sliding along beneath the surface a before but ala never more to rise and blow while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the six barrel cask and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous cask are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slide till at last man handled and stayed in their course and all round the hoop rap rap go a many hammer a can play upon them for now ex officio every sailor is a cooper at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchway are unsealed the bowel of the ship are thrown open and down go the cask to their final rest in the sea this done the hatch are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incident in all the business of whaling one day the plank stream with freshet of blood and oil on the sacred quarter deck enormous mass of the whale s head are profanely piled great rusty cask lie about a in a brewery yard the smoke from the try work ha besooted all the bulwark the mariner go about suffused with unctuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hand the din is deafening but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ear in this self same ship and were it not for the tell tale boat and try work you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the deck never look so white a just after what they call an affair of oil besides from the ash of the burned scrap of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hand go diligently along the bulwark and with bucket of water and rag restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower rigging all the numerous implement which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try work completely hiding the pot every cask is out of sight all tackle are coiled in unseen nook and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship s company the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablution shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow a bridegroom new leaped from out the daintiest holland now with elated step they pace the plank in two and three and humorously discourse of parlor sofa carpet and fine cambric propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to such musked mariner of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and bring u napkin but mark aloft there at the three mast head stand three men intent on spying out more whale which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small grease spot somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest uninterrupted labor which know no night continuing straight through for ninety six hour when from the boat where they have swelled their wrist with all day rowing on the line they only step to the deck to carry vast chain and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweating to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fire of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try work when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellow just buttoning the neck of their clean frock are startled by the cry of there she blow and away they fly to fight another whale and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friend but this is man killing yet this is life for hardly have we mortal by long toilings extracted from this world s vast bulk it small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from it defilement and learned to live here in clean tabernacle of the soul hardly is this done when there she blow the ghost is spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young life s old routine again oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two thousand year ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailed with thee along the peruvian coast last voyage and foolish a i am taught thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope chapter the doubloon ere now it ha been related how ahab wa wont to pace his quarter deck taking regular turn at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other thing requiring narration it ha not been added how that sometimes in these walk when most plunged in his mood he wa wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then a the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness but one morning turning to pas the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figure and inscription stamped on it a though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all thing else all thing are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload a they do hill about boston to fill up some morass in the milky way now this doubloon wa of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hill whence east and west over golden sand the head water of many a pactolus flow and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolt and the verdigris of copper spike yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved it quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hand and through the livelong night shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it wa set apart and sanctified to one awe striking end and however wanton in their sailor way one and all the mariner revered it a the white whale s talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it wa to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it now those noble golden coin of south america are a medal of the sun and tropic token piece here palm alpaca and volcano sun s disk and star ecliptic horn of plenty and rich banner waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glory by passing through those fancy mint so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod wa a most wealthy example of these thing on it round border it bore the letter republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that know no autumn zoned by those letter you saw the likeness of three andes summit from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all wa a segment of the partitioned zodiac the sign all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others wa now pausing there s something ever egotistical in mountain top and tower and all other grand and lofty thing look here three peak a proud a lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magician s glass to each and every man in turn but mirror back his own mysterious self great pain small gain for those who ask the world to solve them it can not solve itself methinks now this coined sun wear a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storm the equinox and but six month before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in throe ti fit that man should live in pain and die in pang so be it then here s stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then no fairy finger can have pressed the gold but devil s claw must have left their moulding there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwark the old man seems to read belshazzar s awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly he go below let me read a dark valley between three mighty heaven abiding peak that almost seem the trinity in some faint earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds u round and over all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shine a beacon and a hope if we bend down our eye the dark vale show her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meet our glance half way to cheer yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it lest truth shake me falsely there now s the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the try work he s been twigging it and there go starbuck from the same and both with face which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathom long and all from looking at a piece of gold which did i have it now on negro hill or in corlaer s hook i d not look at it very long ere spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this a queer i have seen doubloon before now in my voyagings your doubloon of old spain your doubloon of peru your doubloon of chili your doubloon of bolivia your doubloon of popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa here s sign and wonder truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome call the zodiac and what my almanac below call ditto i ll get the almanac and a i have heard devil can be raised with daboll s arithmetic i ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar here s the book let s see now sign and wonder and the sun he s always among em hem hem hem here they are here they go all alive aries or the ram taurus or the bull and jimimi here s gemini himself or the twin well the sun

u the bare word and fact but we come in to supply the thought that s my small experience so far a the massachusetts calendar and bowditch s navigator and daboll s arithmetic go sign and wonder eh pity if there is nothing wonderful in sign and significant in wonder there s a clue somewhere wait a bit hist hark by jove i have it look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round

ll have to say there he s before it he ll out with something presently so so he s beginning i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raise a certain whale this round thing belongs to him so what s all this staring been about it is worth sixteen dollar that s true and at two cent the cigar that s nine hundred and sixty cigar i won t smoke dirty pipe like stubb but i like cigar and here s nine hundred and sixty of them so here go flask aloft to spy em out shall i call that wise or foolish now if it be really wise it ha a foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then ha

other side of the mast why there s a horse shoe nailed on that side and now he s back again what doe that mean hark he s muttering voice like an old worn out coffee mill prick ear and listen if the white whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stand in some one of these sign i ve studied sign and know their mark they were taught me two score year ago by the old witch in copenhagen now in what sign will the sun then be the horse shoe sign for there it is right opposite the gold and what s the horse shoe sign the lion is the horse shoe sign the roaring and devouring

leave him muttering here s the ship s navel this doubloon here and they are all on fire to unscrew it but unscrew your navel and what s the consequence then again if it stay here that is ugly too for when aught s nailed to the mast it s a sign that thing grow desperate ha ha old ahab the white whale he ll nail ye this is a pine tree my father in old tolland county cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it some old darkey s wedding ring how did it get there and so they ll say in the resurrection when they come to fish up this old mast and find a doubloon lodged in it

hey hey jenny jenny and get your hoe cake done chapter leg and arm the pequod of nantucket meet the samuel enderby of london ship ahoy hast seen the white whale so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colour bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man wa standing in his hoisted quarter boat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who wa carelessly reclining in his own boat s bow he wa a darkly tanned burly good natured fine looking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoon of blue pilot cloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar s surcoat hast seen the white whale see you this and withdrawing it from the fold that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oar near him stand by to lower in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it wa always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment s warning now it is no very easy matter for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemen to clamber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea for the great swell now lift the boat high up towards the bulwark and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain it ha before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and in the present instance all this wa heightened by the sight of the two officer of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully ornamented man rope for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannister but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affair stood cried out i see i see avast heaving there jump boy and swing over the cutting tackle a good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackle were still aloft and the massive curved blubber hook now clean and dry wa still attached to the end this wa quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it wa like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand upon one of the running part of the tackle soon he wa carefully swung inside the high bulwark and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two sword fish blade cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let u shake bone together an arm and a leg an arm that never can shrink d ye see and a leg that never can run where did st thou see the white whale how long ago the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the east and taking a rueful sight along it a if it had been a telescope there i saw him on the line last season and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the englishman s shoulder a he did so aye he wa the cause of it at least and that leg too spin me the yarn said ahab how wa it it wa the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman i wa ignorant of the white whale at that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whale and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he wa too that went milling and milling round so that my boat s crew could only trim dish by sitting all their stern on the outer gunwale presently up breach from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milky white head and hump all crow foot and wrinkle it wa he it wa he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath and harpoon sticking in near his starboard fin aye aye they were mine my iron cried ahab exultingly but on give me a chance then said the englishman good humoredly well this old great grandfather with the white head and hump run all afoam into the pod and go to snapping furiously at my fast line aye i see wanted to part it free the fast fish an old trick i know him how it wa exactly continued the one armed commander i do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didn t know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whale s that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matter stood and what a noble great whale it wa the noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in my life i resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the hap hazard line would get loose or the tooth it wa tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boat s crew for a pull on a whale line seeing all this i say i jumped into my first mate s boat mr mounttop s here by the way captain mounttop mounttop the captain a i wa saying i jumped into mounttop s boat which d ye see wa gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old great grandfather have it but lord look you sir heart and soul alive man the next instant in a jiff i wa blind a a bat both eye out all befogged and bedeadened with black foam the whale s tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but a i wa groping at midday with a blinding sun all crown jewel a i wa groping i say after the second iron to toss it overboard down come the tail like a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinter and fluke first the white hump backed through the wreck a though it wa all chip we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoon pole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forward went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down to hell s flame i wa thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript it way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my arm came out nigh my wrist and up i floated and that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captain dr bunger ship s surgeon bunger my lad the captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face wa an exceedingly round but sober one he wa dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pill box held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limb of the two crippled captain but at his superior s introduction of him to ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captain s bidding it wa a shocking bad wound began the whale surgeon and taking my advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the one armed captain addressing ahab go on boy stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the line but it wa no use i did all i could sat up with him night wa very severe with him in the matter of diet oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice drinking hot rum toddy with me every night till he couldn t see to put on the bandage and sending me to bed half sea over about three o clock in the morning oh ye star he sat up with me indeed and wa very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why don t ye you know you re a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead boy i d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sir said the imperturbable godly looking bunger slightly bowing to ahab is apt to be facetious at time he spin u many clever thing of that sort but i may a well say en passant a the french remark that i myself that is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy am a strict total abstinence man i never drink water cried the captain he never drink it it s a sort of fit to him fresh water throw him into the hydrophobia but go on go on with the arm story yes i may a well said the surgeon coolly i wa about observing sir before captain boomer s facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavor the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth wa sir it wa a ugly gaping wound a surgeon ever saw more than two foot and several inch long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew black i knew what wa threatened and off it came but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rule pointing at it with the marlingspike that is the captain s work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that club hammer there put to the end to knock some one s brain out with i suppose a he tried mine once he fly into diabolical passion sometimes do ye see this dent sir removing his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl like cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a wound well the captain there will tell you how that came here he know no i don t said the captain but his mother did he wa born with it oh you solemn rogue you you bunger wa there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future age you rascal what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by play between the two englishman oh cried the one armed captain oh yes well after he sounded we didn t see him again for some time in fact a i before hinted i didn t then know what whale it wa that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby dick a some call him and then i knew it wa he did st thou cross his wake again twice but could not fasten didn t want to try to ain t one limb enough what should i do without this other arm and i m thinking moby dick doesn t bite so much a he swallow well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to get the right do you know gentleman very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession do you know gentleman that the digestive organ of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man s arm and he know it too so that what you take for the white whale s malice is only his awkwardness for he never mean to swallow a single limb he only think to terrify by feint but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that making believe swallow jack knife once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tack d ye see no possible way for him to digest that jack knife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly that s all no thank ye bunger said the english captain he s welcome to the arm he ha since i can t help it and didn t know him then but not to another one no more white whale for me i ve lowered for him once and that ha satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a ship load of precious sperm in him but hark ye he s best let alone don t you think so captain glancing at the ivory leg he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let alone that accursed thing is not always what least allure he s all a magnet how long since thou saw st him last which way heading bless my soul and curse the foul fiend s cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this man s blood bring the thermometer it s at the boiling point his pulse make these plank beat sir taking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to ahab s arm avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwark man the boat which way heading good god cried the english captain to whom the question wa put what s the matter he wa heading east i think is your captain crazy whispering fedallah but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwark to take the boat s steering oar and ahab swinging the cutting tackle towards him commanded the ship s sailor to stand by to lower in a moment he wa standing in the boat s stern and the manilla men were springing to their oar in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod chapter the decanter ere the english ship fade from sight be it set down here that she hailed from london and wa named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby son a house which in my poor whaleman s opinion come not far behind the united royal house of the tudor and bourbon in point of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord this great whaling house wa in existence my numerous fish document do not make plain but in that year it fitted out the first english ship that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of year previous ever since our valiant coffin and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleet pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him in a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and wa the first among the nation to lower a whale boat of any sort in the great south sea the voyage wa a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelia s example wa soon followed by other ship english and american and thus the vast sperm whale ground of the pacific were thrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his son how many their mother only know and under their immediate auspex and partly i think at their expense the british government wa induced to send the sloop of war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval post captain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much doe not appear but this is not all in the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote water of japan that ship well called the syren made a noble experimental cruise and it wa thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known the syren in this famous voyage wa commanded by a captain coffin a nantucketer all honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world the ship named after him wa worthy of the honor being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle it wa a fine gam we had and they were all trump every soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine gam i had long very long after old ahab touched her plank with his ivory heel it mind me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallon the hour and when the squall came for it s squally off there by patagonia and all hand visitor and all were called to reef topsail we were so top heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowline and we ignorantly furled the skirt of our jacket into the sail so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tar however the mast did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pas the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste the beef wa fine tough but with body in it they said it wa bull beef others that it wa dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that wa they had dumpling too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumpling i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiard ball the bread but that couldn t be helped besides it wa an anti scorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle wa not very light and it wa very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimension of the cook s boiler including his own live parchment boiler fore and aft i say the samuel enderby wa a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellow all and capital from boot heel to hat band but why wa it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whaler i know of not all though were such famous hospitable ship that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whaler is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it ha seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollander zealander and dane from whom they derived many term still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashion touching plenty to eat and drink for a a general thing the english merchant ship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated during my research in the leviathanic history i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whaler the title wa dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoir of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery a every whale ship must carry it cooper i wa reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it wa the production of one fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st pott s to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candle for his trouble this same dr snodhead so soon a he spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subject contained a very interesting account of it whale fishery and in this chapter it wa headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the outfit for the larder and cellar of sail of dutch whalemen from which list a translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following lb of beef lb friesland pork lb of stock fish lb of biscuit lb of soft bread firkin of butter lb texel leyden cheese lb cheese probably an inferior article ankers of geneva barrel of beer most statistical table are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipe barrel quart and gill of good gin and good cheer at the time i devoted three day to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thought were incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary table of my own touching the probable quantity of stock fish etc consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unctuous nature being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar sea on the very coast of that esquimaux country where the convivial native pledge each other in bumper of train oil the quantity of beer too is very large barrel now a those polar fishery could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three month say and reckoning men to each of their fleet of sail we have low dutch seaman in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrel of beer per man for a twelve week allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that ankers of gin now whether these gin and beer harpooneer so fuddled a one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat s head and take good aim at flying whale this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this wa very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more enough ha been said to show that the old dutch whaler of two or three century ago were high liver and that the english whaler have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empty the decanter chapter a bower in the arsacides hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvel of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural feature but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the point of his hose unbuckling his garter and casting loose the hook and the eye of the joint of his innermost bone set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean part of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lecture on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a full grown whale on your deck for examination a a cook dish a roast pig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joist and beam the rafter ridge pole sleeper and under pinning making up the frame work of leviathan and belike of the tallow vat dairy room buttery and cheeseries in his bowel i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale wa once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheath for the barb of the harpoon and for the head of the lance think you i let that chance go without using my boat hatchet and jack knife and breaking the seal and reading all the content of that young cub and a for my exact knowledge of the bone of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque year ago when attached to the trading ship dey of algiers i wa invited to spend part of the arsacidean holiday with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a sea side glen not very far distant from what our sailor called bamboo town his capital among many other fine quality my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matter of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare thing the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved wood of wonderful device chiselled shell inlaid spear costly paddle aromatic canoe and all these distributed among whatever natural wonder the wonder freighted tribute rendering wave had cast upon his shore chief among these latter wa a great sperm whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoa nut tree whose plumage like tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of it fathom deep enfolding and the bone become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton wa carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palm now sheltered it the rib were hung with trophy the vertebr were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphic in the skull the priest kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth it vapory spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotee like the hair hung sword that so affrighted damocles it wa a wondrous sight the wood wa green a moss of the icy glen the tree stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath wa a a weaver s loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the ground vine tendril formed the warp and woof and the living flower the figure all the tree with all their laden branch all the shrub and fern and grass the message carrying air all these unceasingly were active through the lacing of the leaf the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver pause one word whither flow the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings speak weaver stay thy hand but one single word with thee nay the shuttle fly the figure float from forth the loom the freshet rushing carpet for ever slide away the weaver god he weave and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voice that speak through it for even so it is in all material factory the spoken word that are inaudible among the flying spindle those same word are plainly heard without the wall bursting from the opened casement thereby have villainy been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great world s loom thy subtlest thinking may be overheard afar now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler yet a the ever woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vine every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curly headed glory now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel a an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priest should swear that smoky jet of his wa genuine to and fro i paced before this skeleton brushed the vine aside broke through the rib and with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid it many winding shaded colonnade and arbour but soon my line wa out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught wa there but bone cutting me a green measuring rod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrow slit in the skull the priest perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted dar st thou measure this our god that s for u aye priest well how long do ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning foot and inch they cracked each other s sconce with their yard stick the great skull echoed and seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please because there are skeleton authority you can refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling port of that country where they have some fine specimen of fin back and other whale likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietor call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united state moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable ha in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no mean of the full grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo s in both case the stranded whale to which these two skeleton belonged were originally claimed by their proprietor upon similar ground king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir clifford because he wa lord of the seignories of those part sir clifford s whale ha been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawer you can open and shut him in all his bony cavity spread out his rib like a gigantic fan and swing all day upon his lower jaw lock are to be put upon some of his trap door and shutter and a footman will show round future visitor with a bunch of key at his side sir clifford think of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead the skeleton dimension i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed a in my wild wandering at that period there wa no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistic but a i wa crowded for space and wished the other part of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i wa then composing at least what untattooed part might remain i did not trouble myself with the odd inch nor indeed should inch at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter measurement of the whale s skeleton in the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base upon captain scoresby s estimate of seventy ton for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty foot in length according to my careful calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between eighty five and ninety foot in length and something less than forty foot in it fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety ton so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitant think you not then that brain like yoked cattle should be put to this leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsman s imagination having already in various way put before you his skull spout hole jaw teeth tail forehead fin and diver other part i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bone but a the colossal skull embrace so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton a it is by far the most complicated part and a nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm a we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view in length the sperm whale s skeleton at tranque measured seventy two foot so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety foot long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventy two foot his skull and jaw comprised some twenty foot leaving some fifty foot of plain back bone attached to this back bone for something less than a third of it length wa the mighty circular basket of rib which once enclosed his vitals to me this vast ivory ribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new laid upon the stock when only some twenty of her naked bow rib are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber the rib were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck wa nearly six foot long the second third and fourth were each successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle rib which measured eight foot and some inch from that part the remaining rib diminished till the tenth and last only spanned five foot and some inch in general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length the middle rib were the most arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beam whereon to lay footpath bridge over small stream in considering these rib i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no mean the mould of his invested form the largest of the tranque rib one of the middle one occupied that part of the fish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen foot whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight foot so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with ton of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowel still more for the ample fin i here saw but a few disordered joint and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless fluke an utter blank how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest peril only when within the eddyings of his angry fluke only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile it bone high up on end no speedy enterprise but now it s done it look much like pompey s pillar there are forty and odd vertebr in all which in the skeleton are not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed block on a gothic spire forming solid course of heavy masonry the largest a middle one is in width something less than three foot and in depth more than four the smallest where the spine taper away into the tail is only two inch in width and look something like a white billiard ball i wa told that there were still smaller one but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchin the priest s child who had stolen them to play marble with thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living thing taper off at last into simple child s play chapter the fossil whale from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not compress him by good right he should only be treated of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlong from spiracle to tail and the yard he measure about the waist only think of the gigantic involution of his intestine where they lie in him like great cable and hawser coiled away in the subterranean orlop deck of a line of battle ship since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germ of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowel having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarity it now remains to magnify him in an arch ological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the leviathan to an ant or a flea such portly term might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest word of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it ha been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertation i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographer s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me one often hears of writer that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capital give me a condor s quill give me vesuvius crater for an inkstand friend hold my arm for in the mere act of penning my thought of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep a if to include the whole circle of the science and all the generation of whale and men and mastodon past present and to come with all the revolving panorama of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding it suburb such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to it bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it ere entering upon the subject of fossil whale i present my credential a a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stone mason and also a great digger of ditch canal and well wine vault cellar and cistern of all sort likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological stratum there are found the fossil of monster now almost completely extinct the subsequent relic discovered in what are called the tertiary formation seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted link between the antichronical creature and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whale hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last preceding the superficial formation and though none of them precisely answer to any known specie of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respect to justify their taking rank a cetacean fossil detached broken fossil of pre adamite whale fragment of their bone and skeleton have within thirty year past at various interval been found at the base of the alp in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the state of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year wa disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bone disinterred in excavating the great dock of antwerp in napoleon s time cuvier pronounced these fragment to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic specie but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relic wa the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awe stricken credulous slave in the vicinity took it for the bone of one of the fallen angel the alabama doctor declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bone of it being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile wa a whale though of a departed specie a significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creature which the mutation of the globe have blotted out of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeleton skull tusk jaw rib and vertebr all characterized by partial resemblance to the existing breed of sea monster but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinity to the annihilated antichronical leviathan their incalculable senior i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man here saturn s grey chaos roll over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpse into those polar eternity when wedged bastion of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropic and in all the mile of this world s circumference not an inhabitable hand s breadth of land wa visible then the whole world wa the whale s and king of creation he left his wake along the present line of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan ahab s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh s methuselah seems a school boy i look round to shake hand with shem i am horror struck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terror of the whale which having been before all time must need exist after all humane age are over but not alone ha this leviathan left his pre adamite trace in the stereotype plate of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon egyptian tablet whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some fifty year ago there wa discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaur griffin and dolphin similar to the grotesque figure on the celestial globe of the modern gliding among them old leviathan swam a of yore wa there swimming in that planisphere century before solomon wa cradled nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous post diluvian reality a set down by the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller not far from the sea side they have a temple the rafter and beam of which are made of whale bone for whale of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pas it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rock that shoot two mile into the sea and wound the whale when they light upon em they keep a whale s rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with it convex part uppermost make an arch the head of which can not be reached by a man upon a camel s back this rib say john leo is said to have layn there a hundred year before i saw it their historian affirm that a prophet who prophesy d of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas wa cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there chapter doe the whale s magnitude diminish will he perish inasmuch then a this leviathan come floundering down upon u from the head water of the eternity it may be fitly inquired whether in the long course of his generation he ha not degenerated from the original bulk of his sire but upon investigation we find that not only are the whale of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whale found in that tertiary system those belonging to it latter formation exceed in size those of it earlier one of all the pre adamite whale yet exhumed by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that wa less than seventy foot in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tape measure give seventy two foot for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemen s authority that sperm whale have been captured near a hundred foot long at the time of capture but may it not be that while the whale of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological period may it not be that since adam s time they have degenerated assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the account of such gentleman a pliny and the ancient naturalist generally for pliny tell u of whale that embraced acre of living bulk and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred foot in length rope walk and thames tunnel of whale and even in the day of bank and solander cooke s naturalist we find a danish member of the academy of science setting down certain iceland whale reydan siskur or wrinkled belly at one hundred and twenty yard that is three hundred and sixty foot and lac p de the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whale in the very beginning of his work page set down the right whale at one hundred metre three hundred and twenty eight foot and this work wa published so late a a d but will any whaleman believe these story no the whale of to day is a big a his ancestor in pliny s time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he wa will make bold to tell him so because i can not understand how it is that while the egyptian mummy that were buried thousand of year before even pliny wa born do not measure so much in their coffin a a modern kentuckian in his sock and while the cattle and other animal sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablet by the relative proportion in which they are drawn just a plainly prove that the high bred stall fed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh s fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of all animal the whale alone should have degenerated but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient look out at the mast head of the whale ship now penetrating even through behring s strait and into the remotest secret drawer and locker of the world and the thousand harpoon and lance darted along all continental coast the moot point is whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the water and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff comparing the humped herd of whale with the humped herd of buffalo which not forty year ago overspread by ten of thousand the prairie of illinois and missouri and shook their iron mane and scowled with their thunder clotted brow upon the site of populous river capital where now the polite broker sell you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale can not now escape speedy extinction but you must look at this matter in every light though so short a period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination wa the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whale hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whale for forty eight month think they have done extremely well and thank god if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the day of the old canadian and indian hunter and trapper of the west when the far west in whose sunset sun still rise wa a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of month mounted on horse instead of sailing in ship would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more buffalo a fact that if need were could be statistically stated nor considered aright doe it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former year the latter part of the last century say these leviathan in small pod were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyage were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because a ha been elsewhere noticed those whale influenced by some view to safety now swim the sea in immense caravan so that to a large degree the scattered solitary yoke and pod and school of other day are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent army that is all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the so called whale bone whale no longer haunt many ground in former year abounding with them hence that specie also is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jet then be sure some other and remoter strand ha been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathan they have two firm fortress which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable and a upon the invasion of their valley the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountain so hunted from the savanna and glade of the middle sea the whale bone whale can at last resort to their polar citadel and diving under the ultimate glassy barrier and wall there come up among icy field and floe and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man but a perhaps fifty of these whale bone whale are harpooned for one cachalot some philosopher of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc ha already very seriously diminished their battalion but though for some time past a number of these whale not less than have been annually slain on the nor west coast by the american alone yet there are consideration which render even this circumstance of little or no account a an opposing argument in this matter natural a it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creature of the globe yet what shall we say to harto the historian of goa when he tell u that at one hunting the king of siam took elephant that in those region elephant are numerous a drove of cattle in the temperate clime and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephant which have now been hunted for thousand of year by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarch of the east if they still survive there in great number much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he ha a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice a large a all asia both america europe and africa new holland and all the isle of the sea combined moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whale their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generation must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the grave yard cemetery and family vault of creation yielding up the live body of all the men woman and child who were alive seventy five year ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe wherefore for all these thing we account the whale immortal in his specie however perishable in his individuality he swam the sea before the continent broke water he once swam over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noah s flood he despised noah s ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the netherlands to kill off it rat then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the sky chapter ahab s leg the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half splintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivot hole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it wa a ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearance lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at time give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not been very long prior to the pequod s sailing from nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stake wise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor wa it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound wa entirely cured nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering wa but the direct issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that a the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind a inevitably a the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable event do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teaching that while some natural enjoyment here shall have no child born to them for the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the joy childlessness of all hell s despair whereas some guilty mortal misery shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of grief beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicity ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracing out not belie the obvious deduction to trail the genealogy of these high mortal misery carry u at last among the sourceless primogeniture of the god so that in the face of all the glad hay making sun and soft cymballing round harvest moon we must need give in to this that the god themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sad birth mark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signer unwittingly here a secret ha been divulged which perhaps might more properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other particular concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it wa that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grand lama like exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge a it were among the marble senate of the dead captain peleg s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no mean adequate though indeed a touching all ahab s deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap wa at the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that ever contracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualty remaining a it did moodily unaccounted for by ahab invested itself with terror not entirely underived from the land of spirit and of wail so that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so far a in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it wa that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequod s deck but be all this a it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive prince and potentate of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedure he called the carpenter and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mate to see him supplied with all the stud and joist of jaw ivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearest grained stuff might be secured this done the carpenter received order to have the leg completed that night and to provide all the fitting for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ship s forge wa ordered to be hoisted out of it temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith wa commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivance might be needed chapter the carpenter seat thyself sultanically among the moon of saturn and take high abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicate both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he wa and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the pequod s carpenter wa no duplicate hence he now come in person on this stage like all sea going ship carpenter and more especially those belonging to whaling vessel he wa to a certain off handed practical extent alike experienced in numerous trade and calling collateral to his own the carpenter s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicraft which more or less have to do with wood a an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod wa singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergency continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four year voyage in uncivilized and far distant sea for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duty repairing stove boat sprung spar reforming the shape of clumsy bladed oar inserting bull s eye in the deck or new tree nail in the side plank and other miscellaneous matter more directly pertaining to his special business he wa moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitude both useful and capricious the one grand stage where he enacted all his various part so manifold wa his vice bench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vice of different size and both of iron and of wood at all time except when whale were alongside this bench wa securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try work a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into it hole the carpenter clap it into one of his ever ready vice and straightway file it smaller a lost land bird of strange plumage stray on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rod of right whale bone and cross beam of sperm whale ivory the carpenter make a pagoda looking cage for it an oarsman sprain his wrist the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion star to be painted upon the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supply the constellation a sailor take a fancy to wear shark bone ear ring the carpenter drill his ear another ha the toothache the carpenter out pincer and clapping one hand upon his bench bid him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably wince under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter sign him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth thus this carpenter wa prepared at all point and alike indifferent and without respect in all teeth he accounted bit of ivory head he deemed but top block men themselves he lightly held for capstan but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing wa this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity a it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of thing that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted mode still eternally hold it peace and ignores you though you dig foundation for cathedral yet wa this half horrible stolidity in him involving too a it appeared an all ramifying heartlessness yet wa it oddly dashed at time with an old crutch like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such a might have served to pas the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah s ark wa it that this old carpenter had been a life long wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he wa a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised a a new born babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trade he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he wa a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscle of his finger he wa like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivance assuming the exterior though a little swelled of a common pocket knife but containing not only blade of various size but also screw driver cork screw tweezer awl pen ruler nail filer countersinkers so if his superior wanted to use the carpenter for a screw driver all they had to do wa to open that part of him and the screw wa fast or if for tweezer take him up by the leg and there they were yet a previously hinted this omnitooled open and shut carpenter wa after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did it duty what that wa whether essence of quicksilver or a few drop of hartshorn there is no telling but there it wa and there it had abided for now some sixty year or more and this it wa this same unaccountable cunning life principle in him this it wa that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body wa a sentry box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake chapter ahab and the carpenter the deck first night watch carpenter standing before his vice bench and by the light of two lantern busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is firmly fixed in the vice slab of ivory leather strap pad screw and various tool of all sort lying about the bench forward the red flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work drat the file and drat the bone that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard so we go who file old jaw and shinbone let s try another aye now this work better sneeze halloa this bone dust is sneeze why it s sneeze yes it s sneeze bless my soul it won t let me speak this is what an old fellow get now for working in dead lumber saw a live tree and you don t get this dust amputate a live bone and you don t get it sneeze come come you old smut there bear a hand and let s have that ferule and buckle screw i ll be ready for them presently lucky now sneeze there s no knee joint to make that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbone why it s easy a making hop pole only i should like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i could turn him out a neat a leg now a ever sneeze scraped to a lady in a parlor those buckskin leg and calf of leg i ve seen in shop window wouldn t compare at all they soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneeze with wash and lotion just like live leg there before i saw it off now i must call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right too short if anything i guess ha that s the heel we are in luck here he come or it s somebody else that s certain ahab advancing during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at time well manmaker just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length let me measure sir measured for a leg good well it s not the first time about it there keep thy finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel it grip once so so it doe pinch some oh sir it will break bone beware beware no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man what s prometheus about there the blacksmith i mean what s he about he must be forging the buckle screw sir now right it s a partnership he supply the muscle part he make a fierce red flame there aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work um m so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for what s made in fire must properly belong to fire and so hell s probable how the soot fly this must be the remainder the greek made the african of carpenter when he s through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder blade there s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack sir hold while prometheus is about it i ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern imprimis fifty foot high in his sock then chest modelled after the thames tunnel then leg with root to em to stay in one place then arm three foot through the wrist no heart at all brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brain and let me see shall i order eye to see outwards no but put a sky light on top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away now what s he speaking about and who s he speaking to i should like to know shall i keep standing here aside ti but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome here s one no no no i must have a lantern ho ho that s it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn what art thou thrusting that thief catcher into my face for man thrusted light is worse than presented pistol i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter carpenter why that s but no a very tidy and i may say an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here carpenter or would st thou rather work in clay sir clay clay sir that s mud we leave clay to ditchers sir the fellow s impious what art thou sneezing about bone is rather dusty sir take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living people s nose sir oh ah i guess so yes oh dear look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that old adam away truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at time may i humbly ask if it be really so sir it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once wa so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do i is t a riddle i should humbly call it a poser sir hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hour then dost thou not fear eavesdropper hold don t speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pain of hell for ever and without a body hah good lord truly sir if it come to that i must calculate over again i think i didn t carry a small figure sir look ye pudding head should never grant premise how long before the leg is done perhaps an hour sir bungle away at it then and bring it to me turn to go oh life here i am proud a greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal inter indebtedness which will not do away with ledger i would be free a air and i m down in the whole world s book i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest pr torians at the auction of the roman empire which wa the world s and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by heaven i ll get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra so carpenter resuming his work well well well stubb know him best of all and stubb always say he s queer say nothing but that one sufficient little word queer he s queer say stubb he s queer queer queer and keep dinning it into mr starbuck all the time queer sir queer queer very queer and here s his leg yes now that i think of it here s his bedfellow ha a stick of whale s jaw bone for a wife and this is his leg he ll stand on this what wa that now about one leg standing in three place and all three place standing in one hell how wa that oh i don t wonder he looked so scornful at me i m a sort of strange thoughted sometimes they say but that s only haphazard like then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep water with tall heron built captain the water chuck you under the chin pretty quick and there s a great cry for life boat and here s the heron s leg long and slim sure enough now for most folk one pair of leg last a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully a a tender hearted old lady us her roly poly old coach horse but ahab oh he s a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wear out bone leg by the cord halloa there you smut bear a hand there with those screw and let s finish it before the resurrection fellow come a calling with his horn for all leg true or false a brewery men go round collecting old beer barrel to fill em up again what a leg this is it look like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core he ll be standing on this to morrow he ll be taking altitude on it halloa i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figure up the latitude so so chisel file and sand paper now chapter ahab and starbuck in the cabin according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the cask below must have sprung a bad leak much concern wa shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair in sperm whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semi weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the cask with sea water which afterwards at varying interval is removed by the ship s pump hereby the cask are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariner readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo now from the south and west the pequod wa drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isle between which lie one of the tropical outlet from the china water into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelago spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coast of the japanese island niphon matsmai and sikoke with his snow white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruning hook of a jack knife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door wa wrinkling his brow and tracing his old course again who s there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it on deck begone captain ahab mistake it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we must up burton and break out up burton and break out now that we are nearing japan heave to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoop either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year what we come twenty thousand mile to get is worth saving sir so it is so it is if we get it i wa speaking of the oil in the hold sir and i wa not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak i m all aleak myself aye leak in leak not only full of leaky cask but those leaky cask are in a leaky ship and that s a far worse plight than the pequod s man yet i don t stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep loaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this life s howling gale starbuck i ll not have the burton hoisted what will the owner say sir let the owner stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoon what care ahab owner owner thou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owner a if the owner were my conscience but look ye the only real owner of anything is it commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ship s keel on deck captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself a better man than i might well pas over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab devil dost thou then so much a dare to critically think of me on deck nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sir to be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most south sea men s cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequod on deck for an instant in the flashing eye of the mate and his fiery cheek you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and a he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man he wax brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured ahab a starbuck disappeared what s that he said ahab beware of ahab there s something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plait of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the t gallant sail and close reef the top sail fore and aft back the main yard up burton and break out in the main hold it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it wa that a respecting starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship however it wa his order were executed and the burton were hoisted chapter queequeg in his coffin upon searching it wa found that the cask last struck into the hold were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumber of the huge ground tier butt and from that black midnight sending those gigantic mole into the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner stone cask containing coin of captain noah with copy of the posted placard vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shook of stave and iron bundle of hoop were hoisted out till at last the piled deck were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot a if you were treading over empty catacomb and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air freighted demijohn top heavy wa the ship a a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well wa it that the typhoon did not visit them then now at this time it wa that my poor pagan companion and fast bosom friend queequeg wa seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his endless end be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecure are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who a harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale but a we have elsewhere seen mount his dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest cask and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneer are the holder so called poor queequeg when the ship wa about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawer the tattooed savage wa crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well and a well or an ice house it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweating he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some day suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few long lingering day till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but a all else in him thinned and his cheek bone grew sharper his eye nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like circle on the water which a they grow fainter expand so his eye seemed rounding and rounding like the ring of eternity an awe that can not be named would steal over you a you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw a strange thing in his face a any beheld who were bystander when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet wa put into word or book and the drawing near of death which alike level all alike impress all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell so that let u say it again no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thought than those whose mysterious shade you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg a he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the ocean s invisible flood tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven not a man of the crew but gave him up and a for queequeg himself what he thought of his case wa forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day wa just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoe of dark wood like the rich war wood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoe and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it wa not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelago for not only do they believe that the star are isle but that far beyond all visible horizon their own mild uncontinented sea interflow with the blue heaven and so form the white breaker of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual sea custom tossed like something vile to the death devouring shark no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whale boat these coffin canoe were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much lee way adown the dim age now when this strange circumstance wa made known aft the carpenter wa at once commanded to do queequeg s bidding whatever it might include there wa some heathenish coffin coloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal grove of the lackaday island and from these dark plank the coffin wa recommended to be made no sooner wa the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took queequeg s measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequeg s person a he shifted the rule ah poor fellow he ll have to die now ejaculated the long island sailor going to his vice bench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin wa to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notch at it extremity this done he marshalled the plank and his tool and to work when the last nail wa driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction overhearing the indignant but half humorous cry with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every one s consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor wa there any denying him seeing that of all mortal some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble u so little for evermore the poor fellow ought to be indulged leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddle of his boat all by his own request also biscuit were then ranged round the side within a flask of fresh water wa placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sail cloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of it comfort if any it had he lay without moving a few minute then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god yojo then crossing his arm on his breast with yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock but ere this wa done pip who had been slily hovering near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbing took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the current carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beach are only beat with water lily will ye do one little errand for me seek out one pip who s now been missing long i think he s in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look he s left his tambourine behind i found it rig a dig dig dig now queequeg die and i ll beat ye your dying march i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in violent fever men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongue and that when the mystery is probed it turn out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongue had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholar so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly voucher of all our heavenly home where learned he that but there hark he speaks again but more wildly now form two and two let s make a general of him ho where s his harpoon lay it across here rig a dig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dy game mind ye that queequeg dy game take ye good heed of that queequeg dy game i say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all a shiver out upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles he s a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from a whale boat i d never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all coward shame upon them let em go drown like pip that jumped from a whale boat shame shame during all this queequeg lay with closed eye a if in a dream pip wa led away and the sick man wa replaced in his hammock but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin wa proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenter s box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence wa this at a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he wa leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred they asked him then whether to live or die wa a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word it wa queequeg s conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six month convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost half well again in a day so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent day but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his foot threw out his arm and leg gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a sea chest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there many spare hour he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figure and drawing and it seemed that hereby he wa striving in his rude way to copy part of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic mark had written out on his body a complete theory of the heaven and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own proper person wa a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mystery not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mystery were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg oh devilish tantalization of the god chapter the pacific when gliding by the bashee isle we emerged at last upon the great south sea were it not for other thing i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth wa answered that serene ocean rolled eastward from me a thousand league of blue there is one know not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirring seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulation of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st john and meet it is that over these sea pasture wide rolling watery prairie and potter field of all four continent the wave should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here million of mixed shade and shadow drowned dream somnambulism revery all that we call life and soul lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberer in their bed the ever rolling wave but made so by their restlessness to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption it roll the midmost water of the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but it arm the same wave wash the mole of the new built californian town but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirt of asiatic land older than abraham while all between float milky way of coral isle and low lying endless unknown archipelago and impenetrable japan thus this mysterious divine pacific zone the world s whole bulk about make all coast one bay to it seems the tide beating heart of earth lifted by those eternal swell you need must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan but few thought of pan stirred ahab s brain a standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isle in whose sweet wood mild lover must be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at length upon these almost final water and gliding towards the japanese cruising ground the old man s purpose intensified itself his firm lip met like the lip of a vice the delta of his forehead s vein swelled like overladen brook in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spout thick blood chapter the blacksmith availing himself of the mild summer cool weather that now reigned in these latitude and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuit shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blistered old blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding his contributory work for ahab s leg but still retained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsman and harpooneer and bowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various weapon and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holding boat spade pike head harpoon and lance and jealously watching his every sooty movement a he toiled nevertheless this old man s wa a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away a if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it wa most miserable a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariner and to the importunity of their persisted questioning he had finally given in and so it came to pas that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate belated and not innocently one bitter winter s midnight on the road running between two country town the blacksmith half stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn the issue wa the loss of the extremity of both foot out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four act of the gladness and the one long and a yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life s drama he wa an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow s technical called ruin he had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughter like loving wife and three blithe ruddy child every sunday went to a cheerful looking church planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family s heart it wa the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for prudent most wise and economic reason the blacksmith s shop wa in the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her young armed old husband s hammer whose reverberation muffled by passing through the floor and wall came up to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout labor s iron lullaby the blacksmith s infant were rocked to slumber oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphan a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after year and all of them a care killing competency but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibility of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest why tell the whole the blow of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eye glitteringly gazing into the weeping face of her child the bellow fell the forge choked up with cinder the house wa sold the mother dived down into the long church yard grass her child twice followed her thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen curl death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but the first salutation to the possibility of the immense remote the wild the watery the unshored therefore to the death longing eye of such men who still have left in them some

come hither bury thyself in a life which to your now equally abhorred and abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death come hither put up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we marry thee hearkening to these voice east and west by early sunrise and by fall of eve the blacksmith s soul responded aye i come and so perth went a whaling chapter the forge with matted beard and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron about mid day perth wa standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an iron wood log with one hand holding a pike head in the coal and with the other at his forge s lung when captain ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rusty looking leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvil the red mass sending off the spark in thick hovering flight some of which flew close to ahab are these thy mother carey s chicken perth they are always flying in thy wake bird of good omen too but not to all look here they burn but thou thou liv st among them without a scorch because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily can st thou scorch a scar well well no more thy shrunk voice sound too calmly sanely woeful to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad thou should st go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad how can st thou endure without being mad do the heaven yet hate thee that thou can st not go mad what wert thou making there welding an old pike head sir there were seam and dent in it and can st thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard usage a it had i think so sir and i suppose thou can st smoothe almost any seam and dent never mind how hard the metal blacksmith aye sir i think i can all seam and dent but one look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hand on perth s shoulder look ye here here can ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou could st blacksmith glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eye answer can st thou smoothe this seam oh that is the one sir said i not all seam and dent but one aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only see st it here in my flesh it ha worked down into the bone of my skull that is all wrinkle but away with child s play no more gaff and pike to day look ye here jingling the leathern bag a if it were full of gold coin i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiend could not part perth something that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone there s the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nail stubbs of the steel shoe of racing horse horse shoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmith ever work i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bone of murderer quick forge me the harpoon and forge me first twelve rod for it shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarn and strand of a tow line quick i ll blow the fire when at last the twelve rod were made ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth this done perth wa about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron a then with regular gasping hem he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rod one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up it intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but a ahab looked up he slid aside what s that bunch of lucifer dodging about there for muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle that parsee smell fire like a fusee and smell of it himself like a hot musket s powder pan at last the shank in one complete rod received it final heat and a perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into ahab s bent face would st thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain have i been but forging my own branding iron then pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this harpoon for the white whale for the white fiend but now for the barb thou must make them thyself man here are my razor the best of steel here and make the barb sharp a the needle sleet of the icy sea for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razor a though he would fain not use them take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray till but here to work fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and a the blacksmith wa about giving the barb their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the water cask near no no no water for that i want it of the true death temper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagan will ye give me a much blood a will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nod replied yes three puncture were made in the heathen flesh and the white whale s barb were then tempered ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled ahab a the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood now mustering the spare pole from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron a coil of new tow line wa then unwound and some fathom of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp string then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and now for the seizing at one extremity the rope wa unstranded and the separate spread yarn were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole wa then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope wa traced half way along the pole s length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and rope like the three fate remained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin light unnatural half bantering yet most piteous sound wa heard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummery not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it chapter the gilder penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground the pequod wa soon all astir in the fishery often in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hour on the stretch they were engaged in the boat steadily pulling or sailing or paddling after the whale or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minute calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pain at such time under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swell seated in his boat light a a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft wave themselves that like hearth stone cat they purr against the gunwale these are the time of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean s skin one forgets the tiger heart that pant beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang these are the time when in his whale boat the rover softly feel a certain filial confident land like feeling towards the sea that he regard it a so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing only the top of her mast seems struggling forward not through high rolling wave but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie a when the western emigrant horse only show their erected ear while their hidden body widely wade through the amazing verdure the long drawn virgin vale the mild blue hill side a over these there steal the hush the hum you almost swear that play wearied child lie sleeping in these solitude in some glad may time when the flower of the wood are plucked and all this mix with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy half way meeting interpenetrate and form one seamless whole nor did such soothing scene however temporary fail of at least a temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden key did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasury yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing oh grassy glade oh ever vernal endless landscape in the soul in ye though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life in ye men yet may roll like young horse in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moment feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them would to god these blessed calm would last but the mingled mingling thread of life are woven by warp and woof calm crossed by storm a storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradation and at the last one pause through infancy s unconscious spell boyhood s thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhood s pondering repose of if but once gone through we trace the round again and are infant boy and men and ifs eternally where lie the final harbor whence we unmoor no more in what rapt ether sail the world of which the weariest will never weary where is the foundling s father hidden our soul are like those orphan whose unwedded mother die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lie in their grave and we must there to learn it and that same day too gazing far down from his boat s side into that same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured loveliness unfathomable a ever lover saw in his young bride s eye tell me not of thy teeth tiered shark and thy kidnapping cannibal way let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep down and do believe and stubb fish like with sparkling scale leaped up in that same golden light i am stubb and stubb ha his history but here stubb take oath that he ha always been jolly chapter the pequod meet the bachelor and jolly enough were the sight and the sound that came bearing down before the wind some few week after ahab s harpoon had been welded it wa a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatch and now in glad holiday apparel wa joyously though somewhat vain gloriously sailing round among the widely separated ship on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home the three men at her mast head wore long streamer of narrow red bunting at their hat from the stern a whale boat wa suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit wa seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signal ensign and jack of all colour were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed top were two barrel of sperm above which in her top mast cross tree you saw slender breaker of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck wa a brazen lamp a wa afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same sea numerous other vessel had gone entire month without securing a single fish not only had barrel of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental cask had been bartered for from the ship she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captain s and officer state room even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling wood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil butt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailor had actually caulked and pitched their chest and filled them it wa humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffee pot and filled it that the harpooneer had headed the socket of their iron and filled them that indeed everything wa filled with sperm except the captain s pantaloon pocket and those he reserved to thrust his hand into in self complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction a this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drum came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try pot which covered with the parchment like poke or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hand of the crew on the quarter deck the mate and harpooneer were dancing with the olive hued girl who had eloped with them from the polynesian isle while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negro with glittering fiddle bow of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ship s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try work from which the huge pot had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cry they raised a the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the ship s elevated quarter deck so that the whole rejoicing drama wa full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion and ahab he too wa standing on his quarter deck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and a the two ship crossed each other s wake one all jubilation for thing passed the other all foreboding a to thing to come their two captain in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelor s commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply no only heard of him but don t believe in him at all said the other good humoredly come aboard thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men not enough to speak of two islander that s all but come aboard old hearty come along i ll soon take that black from your brow come along will ye merry s the play a full ship and homeward bound how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outward bound so go thy way and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessel parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glance towards the receding bachelor but the bachelor s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in and a ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homeward bound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote association together for that vial wa filled with nantucket sounding chapter the dying whale not seldom in this life when on the right side fortune s favourite sail close by u we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sail fill out so seemed it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor whale were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab it wa far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orison curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed a if far over from the deep green convent valley of the manilla isle the spanish land breeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymn soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final waning from the now tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whale dying the turning sunwards of the head and so expiring that strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before he turn and turn him to it how slowly but how steadfastly his homage rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motion he too worship fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sun oh that these too favouring eye should see these too favouring sight look here far water locked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial sea where to tradition no

sea though hill and valley mothered me ye billow are my foster brother chapter the whale watch the four whale slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by it side all night and that boat wa ahab s the waif pole wa thrust upright into the dead whale s spout hole and the lantern hanging from it top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight wave which gently chafed the whale s broad flank like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the shark that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar plank with their tail a sound like the moaning in squadron over asphaltites of unforgiven ghost of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air started from his slumber ahab face to face saw the parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world i have dreamed it again said he of the hearse have i not said old man that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine and who are hearsed that die on the sea but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearse must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hand and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america aye aye a strange sight that parsee a hearse and it plume floating over the ocean with the wave for the pall bearer ha such a sight we shall not soon see believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man and what wa that saying about thyself though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot and when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then ere i can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me still wa it not so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledge that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it take another pledge old man said the parsee a his eye lighted up like fire fly in the gloom hemp only can kill thee the gallows ye mean i am immortal then on land and on sea cried ahab with a laugh of derision immortal on land and on sea both were silent again a one man the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom and ere noon the dead whale wa brought to the ship chapter the quadrant the season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab coming from his cabin cast his eye aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spoke and the eager mariner quickly run to the brace and would stand there with all their eye centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ship s prow for the equator in good time the order came it wa hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bow of his high hoisted boat wa about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude now in that japanese sea the day in summer are a freshet of effulgence that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean s immeasurable burning glass the sky look lacquered cloud there are none the horizon float and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is a the insufferable splendor of god s throne well that ahab s quadrant wa furnished with coloured glass through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrological looking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moment to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain it precise meridian meantime while his whole attention wa absorbed the parsee wa kneeling beneath him on the ship s deck and with face thrown up like ahab s wa eyeing the same sun with him only the lid of his eye half hooded their orb and his wild face wa subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation wa taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant then falling into a moment s revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself thou sea mark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i am but canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be or canst

and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the object on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other it numerous cabalistical contrivance he pondered again and muttered foolish toy baby plaything of haughty admiral and commodore and captain the world brag of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that hold thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to morrow noon and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the thing that cast man s eye aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorch him a these old eye are even now scorched with thy light o sun level by nature to this earth s horizon are the glance of man s eye not shot from the crown of his head a if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee the level ship s compass and the level dead reckoning by log and by line these shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea aye lighting from the boat to the deck thus i trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee a the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead foot a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over the mute motionless parsee s face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seaman clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted out to the brace up helm square in in an instant the yard swung round and a the ship half wheeled upon her heel her three firm seated graceful mast erectly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed a the three horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed standing between the knight head starbuck watched the pequod s tumultuous way and ahab s also a he went lurching along the deck i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of it tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust old man of ocean of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ash aye cried stubb but sea coal ash mind ye that mr starbuck sea coal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab mutter here some one thrust these card into these old hand of mine swears that i must play them and no others and damn me ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it chapter the candle warmest clime but nurse the cruellest fang the tiger of bengal crouch in spiced grove of ceaseless verdure sky the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunder gorgeous cuba know tornado that never swept tame northern land so too it is that in these resplendent japanese sea the mariner encounter the direst of all storm the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening of that day the pequod wa torn of her canvas and bare poled wa left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled mast fluttering here and there with the rag which the first fury of the tempest had left for it after sport holding by a shroud starbuck wa standing on the quarter deck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boat but all their pain seemed naught though lifted to the very top of the crane the windward quarter boat ahab s did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ship s high teetering side stove in the boat s bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck but the sea will have it way stubb for one can t fight it you see mr starbuck a wave ha such a great long start before it leap all round the world it run and then come the spring but a for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never mind it s all in fun so the old song say sings oh jolly is the gale and a joker is the whale a flourishin his tail such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh the scud all a flyin that s his flip only foamin when he stir in the spicin such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh thunder split the ship but he only smack his lip a tastin of this flip such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh avast stubb cried starbuck let the typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace but i am not a brave man never said i wa a brave man i am a coward and i sing to keep up my spirit and i tell you what it is mr starbuck there s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat and when that s done ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a wind up madman look through my eye if thou hast none of thine own what how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale come from the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove in the stern sheet man where he is wont to stand his stand point is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou must i don t half understand ye what s in the wind yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubb s question the gale that now hammer at u to stave u we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive u towards home yonder to windward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homeward i see it lightens up there but not with the lightning at that moment in one of the interval of profound darkness following the flash a voice wa heard at his side and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peal rolled overhead who s there old thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwark to his pivot hole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lance of fire now a the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ship carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but a this conductor must descend to considerable depth that it end may avoid all contact with the hull and a moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishap besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the vessel s way in the water because of all this the lower part of a ship s lightning rod are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender link so a to be the more readily hauled up into the chain outside or thrown down into the sea a occasion may require the rod the rod cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeau to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and aft quick avast cried ahab let s have fair play here though we be the weaker side yet i ll contribute to raise rod on the himmalehs and andes that all the world may be secured but out on privilege let them be sir look aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants all the yard arm were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each tri pointed lightning rod end with three tapering white flame each of the three tall mast wa silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax taper before an altar blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant a a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that it gunwale violently jammed his hand a he wa passing a lashing blast it but slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eye caught the flame and immediately shifting his tone he cried the corpusants have mercy on u all to sailor oath are household word they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curse from the topsail yard arm when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when god s burning finger ha been laid on the ship when his mene mene tekel upharsin ha been woven into the shroud and the cordage while this pallidness wa burning aloft few word were heard from the enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eye gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away constellation of star relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark white teeth which strangely gleamed a if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequeg s tattooing burned like satanic blue flame on his body the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the pequod and every soul on her deck were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it wa stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it wa not the same in the song no no it wasn t i said the corpusants have mercy on u all and i hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long face have they no bowel for a laugh and look ye mr starbuck but it s too dark to look hear me then i take that mast head flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those mast are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a block with sperm oil d ye see and so all that sperm will work up into the mast like sap in a tree yes our three mast will yet be a three spermaceti candle that s the good promise we saw at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once more the high tapering flame were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor the corpusants have mercy on u all cried stubb again at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee wa kneeling in ahab s front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seaman arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasp from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted attitude like the standing or stepping or running skeleton in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eye upcast aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white flame but light the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast link there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire so then turning the last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and high flung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tri pointed trinity of flame oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these sea i a persian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now know that thy right worship is defiance to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and e en for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed no fearless fool now front thee i own thy speechless placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute it unconditional unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the personified impersonal a personality stand here though but a point at best whencesoe er i came wheresoe er i go yet while i earthly live the queenly personality life in me and feel her royal right but war is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come a mere supernal power and though thou launchest navy of full freighted world there s that in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to thee sudden repeated flash of lightning the nine flame leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest close his eye his right hand pressed hard upon them i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor wa it wrung from me nor do i now drop these link thou canst blind but i can then grope thou canst consume but i can then be ash take the homage of these poor eye and shutter hand i would not take it the lightning flash through my skull mine eye ball ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems a beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee the javelin cease open eye see or not there burn the flame oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in my genealogy but thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not oh cruel what hast thou done with her there lie my puzzle but thine is greater thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through thee thy flaming self my scorched eye do dimly see it oh thou foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i read my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee the boat the boat cried starbuck look at thy boat old man ahab s harpoon the one forged at perth s fire remained firmly lashed in it conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whale boat s bow but the sea that had stove it bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire a the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent s tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the arm god god is against thee old man forbear ti an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yard while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this overhearing starbuck the panic stricken crew instantly ran to the brace though not a sail wa left aloft for the moment all the aghast mate s thought seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the rattling lightning link to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope s end petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke all your oath to hunt the white whale are a binding a mine and heart soul and body lung and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune this heart beat look ye here thus i blow out the last fear and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame a in the hurricane that sweep the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolt so at those last word of ahab s many of the mariner did run from him in a terror of dismay chapter the deck towards the end of the first night watch ahab standing by the helm starbuck approaching him we must send down the main top sail yard sir the band is working loose and the lee lift is half stranded shall i strike it sir strike nothing lash it if i had sky sail pole i d sway them up now sir in god s name sir well the anchor are working sir shall i get them inboard strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rise but it ha not got up to my table land yet quick and see to it by mast and keel he take me for the hunch backed skipper of some coasting smack send down my main top sail yard ho gluepots loftiest truck were made for wildest wind and this brain truck of mine now sail amid the cloud scud shall i strike that oh none but coward send down their brain truck in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft there i would e en take it for sublime did i not know that the colic is a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine chapter midnight the forecastle bulwark stubb and flask mounted on them and passing additional lashing over the anchor there hanging no stubb you may pound that knot there a much a you please but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary didn t you once say that whatever ship ahab sail in that ship should pay something extra on it insurance policy just a though it were loaded with powder barrel aft and box of lucifer forward stop now didn t you say so well suppose i did what then i ve part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind besides supposing we are loaded with powder barrel aft and lucifer forward how the devil could the lucifer get afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldn t get afire now shake yourself you re aquarius or the water bearer flask might fill pitcher at your coat collar don t you see then that for these extra risk the marine insurance company have extra guarantee here are hydrant flask but hark again and i ll answer ye the other thing first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pas the rope now listen what s the mighty difference between holding a mast s lightning rod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasn t got any lightning rod at all in a storm don t you see you timber head that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred carry rod and ahab aye man and all of u were in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crew in ten thousand ship now sailing the sea why you king post you i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning rod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officer s skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why don t ye be sensible flask it s easy to be sensible why don t ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible i don t know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard yes when a fellow s soaked through it s hard to be sensible that s a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the turn there and pas it seems to me we are lashing down these anchor now a if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchor here flask seems like tying a man s hand behind him and what big generous hand they are to be sure these are your iron fist hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swing with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and we ve done so next to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out my jacket skirt will ye thank ye they laugh at long togs so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storm afloat the tail tapering down that way serve to carry off the water d ye see same with cocked hat the cock form gable end eave trough flask no more monkey jacket and tarpaulin for me i must mount a swallow tail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew there go my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the wind that come from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad chapter midnight aloft thunder and lightning the main top sail yard tashtego passing new lashing around it um um um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here what s the use of thunder um um um we don t want thunder we want rum give u a glass of rum um um um chapter the musket during the most violent shock of the typhoon the man at the pequod s jaw bone tiller had several time been reelingly hurled to the deck by it spasmodic motion even though preventer tackle had been attached to it for they were slack because some play to the tiller wa indispensable in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no mean uncommon to see the needle in the compass at interval go round and round it wa thus with the pequod s at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the card it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion some hour after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertion of starbuck and stubb one engaged forward and the other aft the shivered remnant of the jib and fore and main top sail were cut adrift from the spar and went eddying away to leeward like the feather of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the wind when that storm tossed bird is on the wing the three corresponding new sail were now bent and reefed and a storm trysail wa set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the course for the present east south east which he wa to steer if practicable wa once more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to it vicissitude but a he wa now bringing the ship a near her course a possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair instantly the yard were squared to the lively song of ho the fair wind oh ye ho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portent preceding it in compliance with the standing order of his commander to report immediately and at any one of the twenty four hour any decided change in the affair of the deck starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yard to the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his state room he involuntarily paused before it a moment the cabin lamp taking long swing this way and that wa burning fitfully and casting fitful shadow upon the old man s bolted door a thin one with fixed blind inserted in place of upper panel the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it wa hooped round by all the roar of the element the loaded musket in the rack were shiningly revealed a they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck wa an honest upright man but out of starbuck s heart at that instant when he saw the musket there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with it neutral or good accompaniment that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself he would have shot me once he murmured yes there s the very musket that he pointed at me that one with the studded stock let me touch it lift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lance strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the pan that s not good best spill it wait i ll cure myself of this i ll hold the musket boldly while i think i come to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doom that s fair for moby dick it s a fair wind that s only fair for that accursed fish the very tube he pointed at me the very one this one i hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now aye and he would fain kill all his crew doe he not say he will not strike his spar to any gale ha he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous sea grope he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error abounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightning rod but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship s company down to doom with him yes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instant put aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in his sleep yes just there in there he s sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i can t withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat command this is all thou breathest aye and say st the men have vow d thy vow say st all of u are ahab great god forbid but is there no other way no lawful way make him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old man s living power from his own living hand only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with rope and hawser chained down to ring bolt on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the sight could not possibly fly his howling all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what then remains the land is hundred of league away and locked japan the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two ocean and a whole continent between me and law aye aye ti so is heaven a murderer when it lightning strike a would be murderer in his bed tindering sheet and skin together and would i be a murderer then if and slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded musket s end against the door on this level ahab s hammock swing within his head this way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again oh mary mary boy boy boy but if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deep starbuck s body this day week may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall i the wind ha gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsail are reefed and set she head her course stern all oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last such were the sound that now came hurtling from out the old man s tormented sleep a if starbuck s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard s arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the death tube in it rack and left the place he s too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him i must see to the deck here thou know st what to say chapter the needle next morning the not yet subsided sea rolled in long slow billow of mighty bulk and striving in the pequod s gurgling track pushed her on like giant palm outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sail the whole world boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun wa only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet ray moved on in stack emblazonings a of crowned babylonian king and queen reigned over everything the sea wa a a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leap with light and heat long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sun s ray produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the sun s rearward place and how the same yellow ray were blending with his undeviating wake ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the sea chariot of the sun ho ho all ye nation before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke on the further billow hallo a tandem i drive the sea but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship wa heading east sou east sir said the frightened steersman thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern upon this every soul wa confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but it very blinding palpableness must have been the cause thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compass his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two compass pointed east and the pequod wa a infallibly going west but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it ha happened before mr starbuck last night s thunder turned our compass that s all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it aye but never before ha it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily here it must need be said that accident like this have in more than one case occurred to ship in violent storm the magnetic energy a developed in the mariner s needle is a all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such thing should be instance where the lightning ha actually struck the vessel so a to smite down some of the spar and rigging the effect upon the needle ha at time been still more fatal all it loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel wa of no more use than an old wife s knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compass be affected the same fate reach all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compass the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needle were exactly inverted shouted out his order for the ship s course to be changed accordingly the yard were hard up and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bow into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her meanwhile whatever were his own secret thought starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite order while stubb and flask who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feeling likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced a for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab wa greater than their fear of fate but a ever before the pagan harpooneer remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it wa only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial heart from inflexible ahab s for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling revery but chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sight tube of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck thou poor proud heaven gazer and sun s pilot yesterday i wrecked thee and to day the compass would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbuck a lance without a pole a top maul and the smallest of the sail maker s needle quick accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he wa now about to do were certain prudential motif whose object might have been to revive the spirit of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous a that of the inverted compass besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needle though clumsily practicable wa not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailor without some shudderings and evil portent men said he steadily turning upon the crew a the mate handed him the thing he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahab s needle but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point a true a any abashed glance of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailor a this wa said and with fascinated eye they awaited whatever magic might follow but starbuck looked away with a blow from the top maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without it touching the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several time the mate still holding the rod a before then going through some small strange motion with it whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertain he called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needle there and horizontally suspended the sail needle by it middle over one of the compass card at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to it place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed look ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eye could persuade such ignorance a theirs and one after another they slunk away in his fiery eye of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride chapter the log and line while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance upon other mean of determining the vessel s place some merchantman and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for form s sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship a well a the presumed average rate of progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwark rain and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the element had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab a he happened to glance upon the reel not many hour after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant wa no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line the ship wa sailing plungingly astern the billow rolled in riot forward there heave the log two seaman came the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take the reel one of ye i ll heave they went towards the extreme stern on the ship s lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind wa now almost dipping into the creamy sidelong rushing sea the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handle end of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him ahab stood before him and wa lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turn to form a preliminary hand coil to toss overboard when the old manxman who wa intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak sir i mistrust it this line look far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee thou seem st to hold or truer perhaps life hold thee not thou it i hold the spool sir but just a my captain say with these grey hair of mine ti not worth while disputing specially with a superior who ll ne er confess what s that there now s a patched professor in queen nature s granite founded college but methinks he s too subservient where wert thou born in the little rocky isle of man sir excellent thou st hit the world by that i know not sir but i wa born there in the isle of man hey well the other way it s good here s a man from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man which is sucked in by what up with the reel the dead blind wall butt all inquiring head at last up with it so the log wa heaved the loose coil rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billow the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely hold hard snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging log wa gone i crush the quadrant the thunder turn the needle and now the mad sea part the log line but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line see to it there he go now to him nothing s happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in tahitian these line run

manxman one daft with strength the other daft with weakness but here s the end of the rotten line all dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new line altogether i ll see mr stubb about it chapter the life buoy steering now south eastward by ahab s levelled steel and her progress solely determined by ahab s level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such unfrequented water descrying no ship and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade wind over wave monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm thing preluding some riotous and desperate scene at last when the ship drew near to the outskirt a it were of the equatorial fishing ground and in the deep darkness that go before the dawn wa sailing by a cluster of rocky islet the watch then headed by flask wa startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly like half articulated wailing of the ghost of all herod s murdered innocent that one and all they started from their revery and for the space of some moment stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it wa mermaid and shuddered but the pagan harpooneer remained unappalled yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner of all declared that the wild thrilling sound that were heard were the voice of newly drowned men in the sea below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it wa then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meaning he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder those rocky island the ship had passed were the resort of great number of seal and some young seal that had lost their dam or some dam that had lost their cub must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her cry and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them because most mariner cherish a very superstitious feeling about seal arising not only from their peculiar tone when in distress but also from the human look of their round head and semi intelligent face seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstance seal have more than once been mistaken for men but the boding of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sun rise this man went from his hammock to his mast head at the fore and whether it wa that he wa not yet half waked from his sleep for sailor sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it wa thus with the man there is now no telling but be that a it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry wa heard a cry and a rushing and looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubble in the blue of the sea the life buoy a long slender cask wa dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at it every pore and the studded iron bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom a if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whale s own peculiar ground that man wa swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least a a portent for they regarded it not a a foreshadowing of evil in the future but a the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shriek they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay the lost life buoy wa now to be replaced starbuck wa directed to see to it but a no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and a in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hand were impatient of any toil but what wa directly connected with it final end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ship s stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange sign and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin a life buoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting rather queer that i should say said stubb it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can arrange it easily bring it up there s nothing else for it said starbuck after a melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me so the coffin i mean dost thou hear me rig it and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand a with a hammer aye and shall i caulk the seam sir moving his hand a with a caulking iron aye and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand a with a pitch pot away what possesses thee to this make a life buoy of the coffin and no more mr stubb mr flask come forward with me he go off in a huff the whole he can endure at the part he baulk now i don t like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wear it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he won t put his head into it are all my pain to go for nothing with that coffin and now i m ordered to make a life buoy of it it s like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i don t like this cobbling sort of business i don t like it at all it s undignified it s not my place let tinker brat do tinkerings we are their better i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair and square mathematical job something that regularly begin at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and come to an end at the conclusion not a cobbler s job that s at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end it s the old woman s trick to be giving cobbling job lord what an affection all old woman have for tinker i know an old woman of sixty five who ran away with a bald headed young tinker once and that s the reason i never would work for lonely widow old woman ashore when i kept my job shop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their lonely old head to run off with me but heigh ho there are no cap at sea but snow cap let me see nail down the lid caulk the seam pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snap spring over the ship s stern were ever such thing done before with a coffin some superstitious old carpenter now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job but i m made of knotty aroostook hemlock i don t budge cruppered with a coffin sailing about with a grave yard tray but never mind we worker in wood make bridal bedstead and card table a well a coffin and hearse we work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for u to ask the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can hem i ll do the job now tenderly i ll have me let s see how many in the ship s company all told but i ve forgotten any way i ll have me thirty separate turk s headed life line each three foot long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go down there ll be thirty lively fellow all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer caulking iron pitch pot and marling spike let s to it chapter the deck the coffin laid upon two line tub between the vice bench and the open hatchway the carpenter caulking it seam the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock ahab come slowly from the cabin gangway and hears pip following him back lad i will be with ye again presently he go not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy middle aisle of a church what s here life buoy sir mr starbuck s order oh look sir beware the hatchway thank ye man thy coffin lie handy to the vault sir the hatchway oh so it doe sir so it doe art not thou the leg maker look did not this stump come from thy shop i believe it did sir doe the ferrule stand sir well enough but art thou not also the undertaker aye sir i patched up this thing here a a coffin for queequeg but they ve set me now to turning it into something else then tell me art thou not an arrant all grasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making leg and the next day coffin to clap them in and yet again life buoy out of those same coffin thou art a unprincipled a the god and a much of a jack of all trade but i do not mean anything sir i do a i do the god again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin the titan they say hummed snatch when chipping out the crater for volcano and the grave digger in the play sings spade in hand dost thou never sing sir do i sing oh i m indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the grave digger made music must have been because there wa none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark to it aye and that s because the lid there s a sounding board and what in all thing make the sounding board is this there s naught beneath and yet a coffin with a body in it ring pretty much the same carpenter hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in faith sir i ve faith what s that why faith sir it s only a sort of exclamation like that s all sir um um go on i wa about to say sir that art thou a silk worm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself look at thy bosom despatch and get these trap out of sight he go aft that wa sudden now but squall come sudden in hot latitude i ve heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of equator cut yon old man too right in his middle he s always under the line fiery hot i tell ye he s looking this way come oakum quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and i m the professor of musical glass tap tap ahab to himself there s a sight there s a sound the greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that thing rest on two line tub full of tow line a most malicious wag that fellow rat tat so man s second tick oh how immaterial are all material what thing real are there but imponderable thought here now s the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life a life buoy of a coffin doe it go further can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortality preserver i ll think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth that it other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return again now then pip we ll talk this over i do suck most wondrous philosophy from thee some unknown conduit from the unknown world must empty into thee chapter the pequod meet the rachel next day a large ship the rachel wa descried bearing directly down upon the pequod all her spar thickly clustering with men at the time the pequod wa making good speed through the water but a the broad winged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sail all fell together a blank bladder that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull bad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail ahab s voice wa heard hast seen the white whale aye yesterday have ye seen a whale boat adrift throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessel s way wa seen descending her side a few keen pull and his boat hook soon clinched the pequod s main chain and he sprang to the deck immediately he wa recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation wa exchanged where wa he not killed not killed cried ahab closely advancing how wa it it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the stranger s boat were engaged with a shoal of whale which had led them some four or five mile from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boat a reserved one had been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat the swiftest keeled of all seemed to have succeeded in fastening at least a well a the man at the mast head could tell anything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it wa concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuer a often happens there wa some apprehension but no positive alarm a yet the recall signal were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boat ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to it fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sail stunsail on stunsail after the missing boat kindling a fire in her try pot for a beacon and every other man aloft on the look out but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent one when last seen though she then paused to lower her spare boat to pull all around her and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boat and though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five mile apart on parallel line and so sweeping a double horizon a it were i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one in that missing boat wore off that captain s best coat mayhap his watch he s so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two pious whale ship cruising after one missing whale boat in the height of the whaling season see flask only see how pale he look pale in the very button of his eye look it wasn t the coat it must have been the my boy my own boy is among them for god s sake i beg i conjure here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition for eight and forty hour let me charter your ship i will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for it if there be no other way for eight and forty hour only only that you must oh you must and you shall do this thing his son cried stubb oh it s his son he s lost i take back the coat and watch what say ahab we must save that boy he s drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manx sailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirit now a it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachel s the more melancholy wa the circumstance that not only wa one of the captain s son among the number of the missing boat s crew but among the number of the other boat s crew at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitude of the chase there had been still another son a that for a time the wretched father wa plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which wa only solved for him by his chief mate s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale ship in such emergency that is when placed between jeopardized but divided boat always to pick up the majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by ahab s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve year old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer s paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the peril and wonder of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor doe it unfrequently occur that nantucket captain will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four year voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whaleman s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father s natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern meantime now the stranger wa still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own i will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to me a you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy captain ahab though but a child and nestling safely at home now a child of your old age too yes yes you relent i see it run run men now and stand by to square in the yard avast cried ahab touch not a rope yarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word captain gardiner i will not do it even now i lose time good bye good bye god bless ye man and may i forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minute from this present instant warn off all stranger then brace forward again and let the ship sail a before hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship soon the two ship diverged their wake and long a the strange vessel wa in view she wa seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea this way and that her yard were swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her mast and yard were thickly clustered with men a three tall cherry tree when the boy are cherrying among the bough but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort she wa rachel weeping for her child because they were not chapter the cabin ahab moving to go on deck pip catch him by the hand to follow lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too curing to my malady like cure like and for this hunt my malady becomes my most desired health do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee a if thou wert the captain aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair another screw to it thou must be no no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg only tread upon me sir i ask no more so i remain a part of ye oh spite of million villain this make me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man and a black and crazy but methinks like cure like applies to him too he grows so sane again they tell me sir that stubb did once desert poor little pip whose drowned bone now show white for all the blackness of his living skin but i will never desert ye sir a stubb did him sir i must go with ye if thou speakest thus to me much more ahab s purpose keel up in him i tell thee no it can not be oh good master master master weep so and i will murder thee have a care for ahab too is mad listen and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still know that i am there and now i quit thee thy hand met true art thou lad a the circumference to it centre so god for ever bless thee and if it come to that god for ever save thee let what will befall ahab go pip step one step forward here he this instant stood i stand in his air but i m alone now were even poor pip here i could endure it but he s missing pip pip ding dong ding who s seen pip he must be up here let s try the door what neither lock nor bolt nor bar and yet there s no opening it it must be the spell he told me to stay here aye and told me this screwed chair wa mine here then i ll seat me against the transom in the ship s full middle all her keel and her three mast before me here our old sailor say in their black seventy four great admiral sometimes sit at table and lord it over row of captain and lieutenant ha what s this epaulet epaulet the epaulet all come crowding pas round the decanter glad to see ye fill up monsieur what an odd feeling now when a black boy s host to white men with gold lace upon their coat monsieur have ye seen one pip a little negro lad five foot high hang dog look and cowardly jumped from a whale boat once seen him no well then fill up again captain and let s drink shame upon all coward i name no name shame upon them put one foot upon the table shame upon all coward hist above there i hear ivory oh master master i am indeed down hearted when you walk over me but here i ll stay though this stern strike rock and they bulge through and oyster come to join me chapter the hat and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahab all other whaling water swept seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean fold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick and now that all his successive meeting with various ship contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunter whether sinning or sinned against now it wa that there lurked a something in the old man s eye which it wa hardly sufferable for feeble soul to see a the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six month night sustains it piercing steady central gaze so ahab s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their boding doubt misgiving fear were fain to hide beneath their soul and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahab s iron soul like machine they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old man s despot eye wa on them but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hour when he thought no glance but one wa on him then you would have seen that even a ahab s eye so awed the crew s the inscrutable parsee s glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at time affected it such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain a it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being s body and that shadow wa always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand still for hour but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eye did plainly say we two watchman never rest nor at any time by night or day could the mariner now step upon the deck unless ahab wa before them either standing in his pivot hole or exactly pacing the plank between two undeviating limit the main mast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabin scuttle his living foot advanced upon the deck a if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eye so that however motionless he stood however the day and night were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eye were really closed at time or whether he wa still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night damp gathered in bead of dew upon that stone carved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the next day s sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the plank whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for he ate in the same open air that is his two only meal breakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled a unearthed root of tree blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life wa now become one watch on deck and though the parsee s mystic watch wa without intermission a his own yet these two never seemed to speak one man to the other unless at long interval some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awe struck crew they seemed pole like asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far a concerned the slightest verbal interchange at time for longest hour without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other a if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance and yet somehow did ahab in his own proper self a daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinate ahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel wa solid ahab at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice wa heard from aft man the mast head and all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsman s bell wa heard what d ye see sharp sharp but when three or four day had slided by after meeting the child seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew s fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneer he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if these suspicion were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his action might seem to hint them i will have the first sight of the whale myself he said aye ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hand he rigged a nest of basketed bowline and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the main mast head he received the two end of the downward reeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate said take the rope sir i give it into thy hand starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for mile and mile ahead astern this side and that within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height when in working with his hand at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chance to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstance it fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who ha the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relation aloft can not always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deck end of these rope are being every few minute cast down from the fastening it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahab s proceeding in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision one of those too whose faithfulness on the look out he had seemed to doubt somewhat it wa strange that this wa the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person s hand now the first time ahab wa perched aloft ere he had been there ten minute one of those red billed savage sea hawk which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast head of whalemen in these latitude one of these bird came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand foot straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizen mast head stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them but already the sable wing wa before the old man s eye the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize an eagle flew thrice round tarquin s head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap wa that omen accounted good ahab s hat wa never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot wa dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea chapter the pequod meet the delight the intense pequod sailed on the rolling wave and day went by the life buoy coffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the delight wa descried a she drew nigh all eye were fixed upon her broad beam called shear which in some whaling ship cross the quarter deck at the height of eight or nine foot serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boat upon the stranger s shear were beheld the shattered white rib and some few splintered plank of what had once been a whale boat but you now saw through this wreck a plainly a you see through the peeled half unhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse hast seen the white whale look replied the hollow cheeked captain from his taffrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck hast killed him the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered side some noiseless sailor were busy in sewing together not forged and snatching perth s levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out exclaiming look ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barb and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the white whale most feel his accursed life then god keep thee old man see st thou that pointing to the hammock i bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his crew are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so then oh god advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hand may the resurrection and the life brace forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men but the suddenly started pequod wa not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made a it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubble might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism a ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange life buoy hanging at the pequod s stern came into conspicuous relief ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake in vain oh ye stranger ye fly our sad burial ye but turn u your taffrail to show u your coffin chapter the symphony it wa a clear steel blue day the firmament of air and sea were hardly separable in that all pervading azure only the pensive air wa transparently pure and soft with a woman s look and the robust and man like sea heaved with long strong lingering swell a samson s chest in his sleep hither and thither on high glided the snow white wing of small unspeckled bird these were the gentle thought of the feminine air but to and fro in the deep far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathan sword fish and shark and these were the strong troubled murderous thinking of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting within the contrast wa only in shade and shadow without those two seemed one it wa only the sex a it were that distinguished them aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even a bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motion most seen here at the equator denoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarm with which the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkle haggardly firm and unyielding his eye glowing like coal that still glow in the ash of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl s forehead of heaven oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged creature that frolic all round u sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old ahab s close coiled woe but so have i seen little miriam and martha laughing eyed elf heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed lock which grew on the marge of that burnt out crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aroma in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the step mother world so long cruel forbidding now threw affectionate arm round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him a if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the pacific contain such wealth a that one wee drop starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there ahab turned starbuck sir oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such a day very much such a sweetness a this i struck my first whale a boy harpooneer of eighteen forty forty forty year ago ago forty year of continual whaling forty year of privation and peril and storm time forty year on the pitiless sea for forty year ha ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty year to make war on the horror of the deep aye and yes starbuck out of those forty year i have not spent three ashore when i think of this life i have led the desolation of solitude it ha been the masoned walled town of a captain s exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without oh weariness heaviness guinea coast slavery of solitary command when i think of all this only half suspected not so keenly known to me before and how for forty year i have fed upon dry salted fare fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil when the poorest landsman ha had fresh fruit to his daily hand and broken the world s fresh bread to my mouldy crust away whole ocean away from that young girl wife i wedded past fifty and sailed for cape horn the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow wife wife rather a widow with her husband alive aye i widowed that poor girl when i married her starbuck and then the madness the frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowering old ahab ha furiously foamingly chased his prey more a demon than a man aye aye what a forty year fool fool old fool ha old ahab been why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or better is ahab now behold oh starbuck is it not hard that with this weary load i bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under me here brush this old hair aside it blind me that i seem to weep lock so grey did never grow but from out some ash but do i look very old so very very old starbuck i feel deadly faint bowed and humped a though i were adam staggering beneath the piled century since paradise god god god crack my heart stave my brain mockery mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hair have i lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old close stand close to me starbuck let me look into a human eye it is better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon god by the green land by the bright hearth stone this is the magic glass man i see my wife and my child in thine eye no no stay on board on board lower not when i do when branded ahab give chase to moby dick that hazard shall not be thine no no not with the far away home i see in that eye oh my captain my captain noble soul grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hated fish away with me let u fly these deadly water let u home wife and child too are starbuck s wife and child of his brotherly sisterly play fellow youth even a thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let u away this instant let me alter the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have some such mild blue day even a this in nantucket they have they have i have seen them some summer day in the morning about this time yes it is his noon nap now the boy vivaciously wake sits up in bed and his mother tell him of me of cannibal old me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again ti my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father s sail yes yes no more it is done we head for nantucket come my captain study out the course and let u away see see the boy s face from the window the boy s hand on the hill but ahab s glance wa averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor command me that against all natural lovings and longing i so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not so much a dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lift this arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is a an errand boy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thought unless god doe that beating doe that thinking doe that living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea look see yon albicore who put it into him to chase and fang that flying fish where do murderer go man who s to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the air smell now a if it blew from a far away meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slope of the andes starbuck and the mower are sleeping among the new mown hay sleeping aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid greenness a last year s scythe flung down and left in the half cut swath starbuck but blanched to a corpse s hue with despair the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eye in the water there fedallah wa motionlessly leaning over the same rail chapter the chase first day that night in the mid watch when the old man a his wont at interval stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivot hole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air a a sagacious ship s dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale wa palpable to all the watch nor wa any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dog vane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor a nearly a possible ahab rapidly ordered the ship s course to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened the acute policy dictating these movement wa sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth a oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkle bordering it the polished metallic like mark of some swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream man the mast head call all hand thundering with the butt of three clubbed handspike on the forecastle deck daggoo roused the sleeper with such judgment clap that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hand what d ye see cried ahab flattening his face to the sky nothing nothing sir wa the sound hailing down in reply t gallant sail stunsails alow and aloft and on both side all sail being set he now cast loose the life line reserved for swaying him to the main royal mast head and in a few moment they were hoisting him thither when while but two third of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main top sail and top gallant sail he raised a gull like cry in the air there she blow there she blow a hump like a snow hill it is moby dick fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look out the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his final perch some foot above the other look out tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top gallant mast so that the indian s head wa almost on a level with ahab s heel from this height the whale wa now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariner it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian ocean and did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the perched men all around him i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i cried out said tashtego not the same instant not the same no the doubloon is mine fate reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised the white whale first there she blow there she blow there she blow there again there again he cried in long drawn lingering methodic tone attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale s visible jet he s going to sound in stunsails down top gallant sail stand by three boat mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go fluke no no only black water all ready the boat there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lower quick quicker and he slid through the air to the deck he is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb right away from u can not have seen the ship yet be dumb man stand by the brace hard down the helm brace up shiver her shiver her so well that boat boat soon all the boat but starbuck s were dropped all the boat sail set all the paddle plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale death glimmer lit up fedallah s sunken eye a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shell their light prow sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe a they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over it wave seemed a noon meadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump wa distinctly visible sliding along the sea a if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkle of the slightly projecting head beyond before it far out on the soft turkish rugged water went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue water interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubble arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light toe of hundred of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to some flag staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale s back and at interval one of the cloud of soft toed fowl hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feather streaming like pennon a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horn his lovely leering eye sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme did surpass the glorified white whale a he so divinely swam on each soft side coincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide away on each bright side the whale shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunter who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornado yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou may st have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus through the serene tranquillity of the tropical sea among wave whose hand clapping were suspended by exceeding rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terror of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginia s natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered fluke in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white sea fowl longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left with oar apeak and paddle down the sheet of their sail adrift the three boat now stilly floated awaiting moby dick s reappearance an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boat s stern and he gazed beyond the whale s place towards the dim blue space and wide wooing vacancy to leeward it wa only an instant for again his eye seemed whirling round in his head a he swept the watery circle the breeze now freshened the sea began to swell the bird the bird cried tashtego in long indian file a when heron take wing the white bird were now all flying towards ahab s boat and when within a few yard began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cry their vision wa keener than man s ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly a he peered down and down into it depth he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying a it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked row of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom it wa moby dick s open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open doored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon fedallah to change place with him went forward to the bow and seizing perth s harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oar and stand by to stern now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon it axis it bow by anticipation wa made to face the whale s head while yet under water but a if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself a it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking it bow full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a row lock the bluish pearl white of the inside of the jaw wa within six inch of ahab s head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar a a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eye fedallah gazed and crossed his arm but the tiger yellow crew were tumbling over each other s head to gain the uttermost stern and now while both elastic gunwale were springing in and out a the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bow for the bow were almost inside of him a it were and while the other boat involuntarily paused a before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it wa that monomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaw he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hand and wildly strove to wrench it from it gripe a now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwale bent in collapsed and snapped a both jaw like an enormous shear sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wreck these floated aside the broken end drooping the crew at the stern wreck clinging to the gunwale and striving to hold fast to the oar to lash them across at that preluding moment ere the boat wa yet snapped ahab the first to perceive the whale s intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the whale s mouth and tilting over sideways a it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it a he leaned to the push and so he fell flat faced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billow and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more foot out of the water the now rising swell with all their confluent wave dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel billow only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap it summit with their scud this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives it designation pitchpoling from it being likened to that preliminary up and down poise of the whale lance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever object may be encircling him but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake a if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him a the blood of grape and mulberry cast before antiochus s elephant in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale s insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim though he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool a that helpless ahab s head wa seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the boat s fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him more than enough wa it for them to look to themselves for so revolvingly appalling wa the white whale s aspect and so planetarily swift the ever contracting circle he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boat unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaway ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eye then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old man s head meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship s mast head and squaring her yard she had borne down upon the scene and wa now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed her sail on the but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shouted sail on the whale drive him off the pequod s prow were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim a he sullenly swam off the boat flew to the rescue dragged into stubb s boat with blood shot blinded eye the white brine caking in his wrinkle the long tension of ahab s bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his body s doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb s boat like one trodden under foot of herd of elephant far inland nameless wail came from him a desolate sound from out ravine but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it in an instant s compass great heart sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pain kindly diffused through feebler men s whole life and so such heart though summary in each one suffering still if the god decree it in their life time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensity for even in their pointless centre those noble nature contain the entire circumference of inferior soul the harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one bended arm is it safe aye sir for it wa not darted this is it said stubb showing it lay it before me any missing men one two three four five there were five oar sir and here are five men that s good help me man i wish to stand so so i see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spout hand off from me the eternal sap run up in ahab s bone again set the sail out oar the helm it is often the case that when a boat is stove it crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called double banked oar it wa thus now but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed to have treble banked his every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstance pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself then a it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate mean of overtaking the chase accordingly the boat now made for her and were soon swayed up to their crane the two part of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her and then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it with stun sail like the double jointed wing of an albatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby dick at the well known methodic interval the whale s glittering spout wa regularly announced from the manned mast head and when he would be reported a just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnacle watch in hand so soon a the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice wa heard whose is the doubloon now d ye see him and if the reply wa no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the plank a he wa thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadth thus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarter deck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and a in an already over clouded sky fresh troop of cloud will sometimes sail across so over the old man s face there now stole some such added gloom a this stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his captain s mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimed the thistle the as refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha what soulless thing is this that laugh before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave a fearless fire and a mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck aye sir said starbuck drawing near ti a solemn sight an omen and an ill one omen omen the dictionary if the god think to speak outright to man they will honorably speak outright not shake their head and give an old wife darkling hint begone ye two are the opposite pole of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab stand alone among the million of the peopled earth nor god nor men his neighbor cold cold i shiver how now aloft there d ye see him sing out for every spout though he spout ten time a second the day wa nearly done only the hem of his golden robe wa rustling soon it wa almost dark but the look out men still remained unset can t see the spout now sir too dark cried a voice from the air how heading when last seen a before sir straight to leeward good he will travel slower now ti night down royal and top gallant stun sail mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning he s making a passage now and may heave to a while helm there keep her full before the wind aloft come down mr stubb send a fresh hand to the fore mast head and see it manned till morning then advancing towards the doubloon in the main mast men this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye first raise him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that man s and if on that day i shall again raise him then ten time it sum shall be divided among all of ye away now the deck is thine sir and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at interval rousing himself to see how the night wore on chapter the chase second day at day break the three mast head were punctually manned afresh d ye see him cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread see nothing sir turn up all hand and make sail he travel faster than i thought for the top gallant sail aye they should have been kept on her all night but no matter ti but resting for the rush here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no mean unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural genius among the nantucket commander that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstance pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of sight a well a his probable rate of progression during that period and in these case somewhat a a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well know and which he desire shortly to return to again but at some further point like a this pilot stand by his compass and take the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so doe the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hour of daylight then when night obscures the fish the creature s future wake through the darkness is almost a established to the sagacious mind of the hunter a the pilot s coast is to him so that to this hunter s wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purpose well nigh a reliable a the steadfast land and a the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in it every pace that with watch in their hand men time his rate a doctor that of a baby s pulse and lightly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasion when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hour hence this whale will have gone two hundred mile will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whaleman s ally for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety three league and a quarter from his port inferable from these statement are many collateral subtile matter touching the chase of whale the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea a when a cannon ball missent becomes a plough share and turn up the level field by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deck creep up one s leg and tingle at the heart this ship and i are two brave fellow ha ha some one take me up and launch me spine wise on the sea for by live oak my spine s a keel ha ha we go the gait that leaf no dust behind there she blow she blow she blow right ahead wa now the mast head cry aye aye cried stubb i knew it ye can t escape blow on and split your spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trump blister your lung ahab will dam off your blood a a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzy of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine worked anew whatever pale fear and foreboding some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all side routed a timid prairie hare that scatter before the bounding bison the hand of fate had snatched all their soul and by the stirring peril of the previous day the rack of the past night s suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards it flying mark by all these thing their heart were bowled along the wind that made great belly of their sail and rushed the vessel on by arm invisible a irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race they were one man not thirty for a the one ship that held them all though it wa put together of all contrasting thing oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on it way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individuality of the crew this man s valor that man s fear guilt and guiltiness all variety were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to the rigging lived the mast head like the top of tall palm were outspreadingly tufted with arm and leg clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient waving others shading their eye from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yard all the spar in full bearing of mortal ready and ripe for their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after the lapse of some minute since the first cry no more had been heard sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick cast one odd jet that way and then disappears it wa even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale spout a the event itself soon proved for hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly wa the rope belayed to it pin on deck when he struck the key note to an orchestra that made the air vibrate a with the combined discharge of rifle the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lung wa heard a much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead moby dick bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depth the sperm whale thus boom his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam show his place to the distance of seven mile and more in those moment the torn enraged wave he shake off seem his mane in some case this breaching is his act of defiance there she breach there she breach wa the cry a in his immeasurable bravado the white whale tossed himself salmon like to heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from it first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale aye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand down down all of ye but one man at the fore the boat stand by unmindful of the tedious rope ladder of the shroud the men like shooting star slid to the deck by the isolated backstay and halyard while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly wa dropped from his perch lower away he cried so soon a he had reached his boat a spare one rigged the afternoon previous mr starbuck the ship is thine keep away from the boat but keep near them lower all a if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself moby dick had turned and wa now coming for the three crew ahab s boat wa central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale head and head that is pull straight up to his forehead a not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale s sidelong vision but ere that close limit wa gained and while yet all three boat were plain a the ship s three mast to his eye the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an instant a it were rushing among the boat with open jaw and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the iron darted at him from every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boat were made but skilfully man uvred incessantly wheeling like trained charger in the field the boat for a while eluded him though at time but by a plank s breadth while all the time ahab s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shred but at last in his untraceable evolution the white whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand way entangled the slack of the three line now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boat towards the planted iron in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little a if to rally for a more tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more line and then wa rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarl when lo a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of shark caught and twisted corkscrewed in the maze of the line loose harpoon and lance with all their bristling barb and point came flashing and dripping up to the chock in the bow of ahab s boat only one thing could be done seizing the boat knife he critically reached within through and then without the ray of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chock dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and wa all fast again that instant the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangle of the other line by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boat of stubb and flask towards his fluke dashed them together like two rolling husk on a surf beaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chip of the wreck danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch while the two crew were yet circling in the water reaching out after the revolving line tub oar and other floating furniture while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his leg upwards to escape the dreaded jaw of shark and stubb wa lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old man s line now parting admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted peril ahab s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wire a arrow like shooting perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against it bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell again gunwale downwards and ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seal from a sea side cave the first uprising momentum of the whale modifying it direction a he struck the surface involuntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his fluke from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boat touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea but soon a if satisfied that his work for that time wa done he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled line continued his leeward way at a traveller s methodic pace a before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariner tub oar and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her deck some sprained shoulder wrist and ankle livid contusion wrenched harpoon and lance inextricable intricacy of rope shattered oar and plank all these were there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one a with fedallah the day before so ahab wa now found grimly clinging to his boat s broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him a the previous day s mishap but when he wa helped to the deck all eye were fastened upon him a instead of standing by himself he still half hung upon the shoulder of starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter aye aye starbuck ti sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he ha the ferrule ha not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up i put good work into that leg but no bone broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern aye and all splintered to piece stubb d ye see it but

chasing this murderous fish till he swamp the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh oh impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more starbuck of late i ve felt strangely moved to thee ever since that hour we both saw thou know st what in one another s eye but in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me a the palm of this hand a lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this whole act s immutably decreed twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion year before this ocean rolled fool i am the fate lieutenant i act under order look thou underling that thou obeyest mine stand round me men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot ti ahab his body s part but ahab s soul s a centipede that move upon a hundred leg i feel strained half stranded a rope that tow dismasted frigate in a gale and i may look so but ere i break ye ll hear me crack and till ye hear that know that ahab s hawser tow his purpose yet believe ye men in the thing called omen then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they drown drowning thing will twice rise to the surface then rise again to sink for evermore so with moby dick two day he s floated tomorrow will be the third aye men he ll rise once more but only to spout his last d ye feel brave men brave a fearless fire cried stubb and a mechanical muttered ahab then a the men went forward he muttered on the thing called omen and yesterday i talked the same to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantly i seek to drive out of others heart what s clinched so fast in mine the parsee the parsee gone gone and he wa to go before but still wa to be seen again ere i could perish how s that there s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyer backed by the ghost of the whole line of judge like a hawk s beak it peck my brain i ll i ll solve it though when dusk descended the whale wa still in sight to leeward so once more the sail wa shortened and everything passed nearly a on the previous night only the sound of hammer and the hum of the grindstone wa heard till nearly daylight a the men toiled by lantern in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boat and sharpening their fresh weapon for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of ahab s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still a on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on it dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun chapter the chase third day the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary night man at the fore mast head wa relieved by crowd of the daylight look out who dotted every mast and almost every spar d ye see him cried ahab but the whale wa not yet in sight in his infallible wake though but follow that wake that s all helm there steady a thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a new made world and made for a summer house to the angel and this morning the first of it throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world here s food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never think he only feel feel feel that s tingling enough for mortal man to think s audacity god only ha that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor heart throb and our poor brain beat too much for that and yet i ve sometimes thought my brain wa very calm frozen calm this old skull crack so like a glass in which the content turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no it s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy cleft of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild wind blow it they whip it about me a the torn shred of split sail lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that ha no doubt blown ere this through prison corridor and cell and ward of hospital and ventilated them and now come blowing hither a innocent a fleece out upon it it s tainted were i the wind i d blow no more on such a wicked miserable world i d crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet ti a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight it ha the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that strike stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thing a nobler thing than that would now the wind but had a body but all the thing that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these thing are bodiless but only bodiless a object not a agent there s a most special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i say again and swear it now that there s something all glorious and gracious in the wind these warm trade wind at least that in the clear heaven blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser current of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal pole these same trade that so directly blow my good ship on these trade or something like them something so unchangeable and full a strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what d ye see nothing sir nothing and noon at hand the doubloon go a begging see the sun aye aye it must be so i ve oversailed him how got the start aye he s chasing me now not i him that s bad i might have known it too fool the line the harpoon he s towing aye aye i have run him by last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look out man the brace steering a she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequod s quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze a she rechurned the cream in her own white wake against the wind he now steer for the open jaw murmured starbuck to himself a he coiled the new hauled main brace upon the rail god keep u but already my bone feel damp within me and from the inside wet my flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him stand by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket we should meet him soon aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahab s bidding and once more ahab swung on high a whole hour now passed gold beaten out to age time itself now held long breath with keen suspense but at last some three point off the weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mast head three shriek went up a if the tongue of fire had voiced it forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck there brace sharper up crowd her into the wind s eye he s too far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sail shake stand over that helmsman with a top maul so so he travel fast and i must down but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there s time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sand hill of nantucket the same the same the same to noah a to me there s a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead somewhere to something else than common land more palmy than the palm leeward the white whale go that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old mast head what s this green aye tiny moss in these warped crack no such green weather stain on ahab s head there s the difference now between man s old age and matter s but aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hull though are we not my ship aye minus a leg that s all by heaven this dead wood ha the better of my live flesh every way i can t compare with it and i ve known some ship made of dead tree outlast the life of men made of the most vital stuff of vital father what s that he said he should still go before me my pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eye at the bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stair and all night i ve been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou told st direful truth a touching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short good bye mast head keep a good eye upon the whale the while i m gone we ll talk to morrow nay to night when the white whale lie down there tied by head and tail he gave the word and still gazing round him wa steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck in due time the boat were lowered but a standing in his shallop s stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the mate who held one of the tackle rope on deck and bade him pause starbuck sir for the third time my soul s ship start upon this voyage starbuck aye sir thou wilt have it so some ship sail from their port and ever afterwards are missing starbuck truth sir saddest truth some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of the flood and i feel now like a billow that s all one crested comb starbuck i am old shake hand with me man their hand met their eye fastened starbuck s tear the glue oh my captain my captain noble heart go not go not see it s a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then lower away cried ahab tossing the mate s arm from him stand by the crew in an instant the boat wa pulling round close under the stern the shark the shark cried a voice from the low cabin window there o master my master come back but ahab heard nothing for his own voice wa high lifted then and the boat leaped on yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when number of shark seemingly rising from out the dark water beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blade of the oar every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bite it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale boat in those swarming sea the shark at time apparently following them in the same prescient way that vulture hover over the banner of marching regiment in the east but these were the first shark that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried and whether it wa that ahab s crew were all such tiger yellow barbarian and therefore their flesh more musky to the sens of the shark a matter sometimes well known to affect them however it wa they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eye the receding boat canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight lowering thy keel among ravening shark and followed by them open mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day for when three day flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thing be that end what it may oh my god what is this that shoot through me and leaf me so deadly calm yet expectant fixed at the top of a shudder future thing swim before me a in empty outline and skeleton all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl thou fadest in pale glory behind me boy i seem to see but thy eye grown wondrous blue strangest problem of life seem clearing but cloud sweep between is my journey s end coming my leg feel faint like his who ha footed it all day feel thy heart beat it yet stir thyself starbuck stave it off move move speak aloud mast head there see ye my boy s hand on the hill crazed aloft there keep thy keenest eye upon the boat mark well the whale ho again drive off that hawk see he peck he tear the vane pointing to the red flag flying at the main truck ha he soar away with it where s the old man now see st thou that sight oh ahab shudder shudder the boat had not gone very far when by a signal from the mast head a downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence a the head beat wave hammered and hammered against the opposing bow drive drive in your nail oh ye wave to their uttermost head drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no hearse can be mine and hemp only can kill me ha ha suddenly the water around them slowly swelled in broad circle then quickly upheaved a if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound wa heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breath a bedraggled with trailing rope and harpoon and lance a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty foot upwards the water flashed for an instant like heap of fountain then brokenly sank in a shower of flake leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale give way cried ahab to the oarsman and the boat darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterday s fresh iron that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angel that fell from heaven the wide tier of welded tendon overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together a head on he came churning his tail among the boat and once more flailed them apart spilling out the iron and lance from the two mate boat and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bow but leaving ahab s almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained plank and a the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank a he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round and round to the fish s back pinioned in the turn upon turn in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involution of the line around him the half torn body of the parsee wa seen his sable raiment frayed to shred his distended eye turned full upon old ahab the harpoon dropped from his hand befooled befooled drawing in a long lean breath aye parsee i see thee again aye and thou goest before and this this then is the hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mate to the ship those boat are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to die down men the first thing that but offer to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not other men but my arm and my leg and so obey me where s the whale gone down again but he looked too nigh the boat for a if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and a if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick wa now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the ship which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea oh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third day to desist see moby dick seek thee not it is thou thou that madly seekest him setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat wa swiftly impelled to leeward by both oar and canvas and at last when ahab wa sliding by the vessel so near a plainly to distinguish starbuck s face a he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mast head while the oarsman were rocking in the two staved boat which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after the other through the port hole a he sped he also caught flying glimpse of stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundle of new iron and lance a he saw all this a he heard the hammer in the broken boat far other hammer seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or flag wa gone from the main mast head he shouted to tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nail and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three day running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it wa some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever wa true the white whale s way now began to abate a it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whale s last start had not been so long a one a before and still a ahab glided over the wave the unpitying shark accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oar that the blade became jagged and crunched and left small splinter in the sea at almost every dip heed them not those teeth but give new rowlock to your oar pull on ti the better rest the shark s jaw than the yielding water but at every bite sir the thin blade grow smaller and smaller they will last long enough pull on but who can tell he muttered whether these shark swim to feast on the whale or on ahab but pull on aye all alive now we near him the helm take the helm let me pas and so saying two of the oarsman helped him forward to the bow of the still flying boat at length a the craft wa cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whale s flank he seemed strangely oblivious of it advance a the whale sometimes will and ahab wa fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whale s spout curled round his great monadnock hump he wa even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arm lengthwise high lifted to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale a both steel and curse sank to the socket a if sucked into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea a it wa three of the oarsman who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for it effect these were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to it level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turn with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seat and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air what break in me some sinew crack ti whole again oar oar burst in upon him hearing the tremendous rush of the sea crashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecution bethinking it it may be a larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon it advancing prow smiting his jaw amid fiery shower of foam ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hand stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way is t night the whale the ship cried the cringing oarsman oar oar slope downwards to thy depth o sea that ere it be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship but a the oarsman violently forced their boat through the sledge hammering sea the before whale smitten bow end of two plank burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the wave it half wading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water meantime for that one beholding instant tashtego s mast head hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag half wrapping him a with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him a his own forward flowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the down coming monster just a soon a he the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet power of air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a woman s fainting fit up helm i say ye fool the jaw the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayer all my life long fidelity oh ahab ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turn to meet u oh his unappeasable brow drive on towards one whose duty tell him he can not depart my god stand by me now stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help stubb for stubb too stick here i grin at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubb s own unwinking eye and now poor stubb go to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale look ye sun moon and star i call ye assassin of a good a fellow a ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glass with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but there ll be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye not o ahab for me off shoe and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawer a most mouldy and over salted death though cherry cherry cherry oh flask for one red cherry ere we die cherry i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope my poor mother s drawn my part pay ere this if not few copper will now come to her for the voyage is up from the ship s bow nearly all the seaman now hung inactive hammer bit of plank lance and harpoon mechanically retained in their hand just a they had darted from their various employment all their enchanted eye intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him a he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship s starboard bow till men and timber reeled some fell flat upon their face like dislodged truck the head of the harpooneer aloft shook on their bull like neck through the breach they heard the water pour a mountain torrent down a flume the ship the hearse the second hearse cried ahab from the boat it wood could only be american diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along it keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yard of ahab s boat where for a time he lay quiescent i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered spire of mine thou uncracked keel and only god bullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and pole pointed prow death glorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captain oh lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lie in my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bound pour ye now in ye bold billow of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death towards thee i roll thou all destroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with thee from hell s heart i stab at thee for hate s sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffin and all hearse to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to piece while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale thus i give up the spear the harpoon wa darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the groove ran foul ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly a turkish mute bowstring their victim he wa shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he wa gone next instant the heavy eye splice in the rope s final end flew out of the stark empty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in it depth for an instant the tranced boat s crew stood still then turned the ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering medium saw her sidelong fading phantom a in the gaseous fata morgana only the uppermost mast out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perch the pagan harpooneer still maintained their sinking lookout on the sea and now concentric circle seized the lone boat itself and all it crew and each floating oar and every lance pole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight but a the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inch of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yard of the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billow they almost touched at that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a sky hawk that tauntingly had followed the main truck downwards from it natural home among the star pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept it broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savage beneath in his death gasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shriek and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it now small fowl flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against it steep side then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on a it rolled five thousand year ago epilogue and i only am escaped alone to tell thee job the drama s done why then here doe any one step forth because one did survive the wreck it so chanced that after the parsee s disappearance i wa he whom the fate ordained to take the place of ahab s bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat wa dropped astern so floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i wa then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had subsided to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting towards the button like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another ixion i did revolve till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of it cunning spring and owing to it great buoyancy rising with great force the coffin life buoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main

jackson hadn t run the creek up the creek simon finch would never have paddled up the alabama and where would we be if he hadn t we were far too old to settle an argument with a fist fight so we consulted atticus our father said we were both right being southerner it wa a source of shame to some member of the family that we had no recorded ancestor on either side of the battle of hastings all we had wa simon finch a fur trapping apothecary from cornwall whose piety wa exceeded only by his stinginess in england simon wa irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves methodist at the hand of their more liberal brother and a simon called himself a methodist he worked his way across the atlantic to philadelphia thence to jamaica thence to mobile and up the saint stephen mindful of john wesley s stricture on the use of many word in buying and selling simon made a pile practicing medicine but in this pursuit he wa unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew wa not for the glory of god a the putting on of gold and costly apparel so simon having forgotten his teacher s dictum on the possession of human chattel bought three slave and with their aid established a homestead on the bank of the alabama river some forty mile above saint stephen he returned to saint stephen only once to find a wife and with her established a line that ran high to daughter simon lived to an impressive age and died rich it wa customary for the men in the family to remain on simon s homestead finch s landing and make their living from cotton the place wa self sufficient modest in comparison with the empire around it the landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice wheat flour and article of clothing supplied by river boat from mobile simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the north and the south a it left his descendant stripped of everything but their land yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century when my father atticus finch went to montgomery to read law and his younger brother went to boston to study medicine their sister alexandra wa the finch who remained at the landing she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot line were full when my father wa admitted to the bar he returned to maycomb and began his practice maycomb some twenty mile east of finch s landing wa the county seat of maycomb county atticus s office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack a spittoon a checkerboard and an unsullied code of alabama his first two client were the last two person hanged in the maycomb county jail atticus had urged them to accept the state s generosity in allowing them to plead guilty to second degree murder and escape with their life but they were haverfords in maycomb county a name synonymous with jackass the haverfords had dispatched maycomb s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witness and insisted that the son of a bitch had itcoming to him wa a good enough defense for anybody they persisted in pleading not guilty to first degree murder so there wa nothing much atticus could do for his client except be present at their departure an occasion that wa probably the beginning of my father s profound distaste for the practice of criminal law during his first five year in maycomb atticus practiced economy more than anything for several year thereafter he invested his earnings in his brother s education john hale finch wa ten year younger than my father and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton wa not worth growing but after getting uncle jack started atticus derived a reasonable income from the law he liked maycomb he wa maycomb county born and bred he knew his people they knew him and because of simon finch s industry atticus wa related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town maycomb wa an old town but it wa a tired old town when i first knew it in rainy weather the street turned to red slop grass grew on the sidewalk the courthouse sagged in the square somehow it wa hotter then a black dog suffered on a summer s day bony mule hitched to hoover cart flicked fly in the sweltering shade of the live oak on the square men s stiff collar wilted by nine in the morning lady bathed before noon after their three o clock nap and by nightfall were like soft teacake with frosting of sweat and sweet talcum people moved slowly then they ambled across the square shuffled in and out of the store around it took their time about everything a day wa twenty four hour long but seemed longer there wa no hurry for there wa nowhere to go nothing to buy and no money to buy it with nothing to see outside the boundary of maycomb county but it wa a time of vague optimism for some

remember our mother died when i wa two so i never felt her absence she wa a graham from montgomery atticus met her when he wa first elected to the state legislature he wa middle aged then she wa fifteen year his junior jem wa the product of their first year of marriage four year later i wa born and two year later our mother died from a sudden heart attack they said it ran in her family i did not miss her but i think jem did he remembered her clearly and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length then go off and play by himself behind the car house when he wa like that i knew better than to bother him when i wa almost six and jem wa nearly ten our summertime boundary within calling distance of calpurnia were mr henry lafayette dubose s house two door to the north of u and the radley place three door to the south we were never tempted to break them the radley place wa inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom wa enough to make u behave for day on end mr dubose wa plain hell that wa the summer dill came to u early one morning a we were beginning our day s play in the back yard jem and i heard something next door in miss rachel haverford s collard patch we went to the wire fence to see if there wa a puppy miss rachel s rat terrier wa expecting instead we found someone sitting looking at u sitting down he wasn t much higher than the collard we stared at him until he spoke hey hey yourself said jem pleasantly i m charles baker harris he said i can read so what i said i just thought you d like to know i can read you got anything need readin i can do it how old are you asked jem four and a half goin on seven shoot no wonder then said jem jerking his thumb at me scout yonder s been readin ever since she wa born and she ain t even started to school yet you look right puny for goin on seven i m little but i m old he said jem brushed his hair back to get a better look why don t you come over charles baker harris he said lord what a name s not any funnier n yours aunt rachel say your name s jeremy atticus finch jem scowled i m big enough to fit mine he said your name s longer n you are bet it s a foot longer folk call me dill said dill struggling under the fence do better if you go over it instead of under it i said where d you come from dill wa from meridian mississippi wa spending the summer with his aunt miss rachel and would be spending every summer in maycomb from now on his family wa from maycomb county originally his mother worked for a photographer in meridian had entered his picture in a beautiful child contest and won five dollar she gave the money to dill who went to the picture show twenty time on it don t have any picture show here except jesus one in the courthouse sometimes said jem ever see anything good dill had seen dracula a revelation that moved jem to eye him with the beginning of respect tell it to u he said dill wa a curiosity he wore blue linen short that buttoned to his shirt his hair wa snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff he wa a year my senior but i towered over him a he told u the old tale his blue eye would lighten and darken his laugh wa sudden and happy he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead when dill reduced dracula to dust and jem said the show sounded better than the book i asked dill where his father wa you ain t said anything about him i haven t got one is he dead no then if he s not dead you ve got one haven t you dill blushed and jem told me to hush a sure sign that dill had been studied and found acceptable thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment routine contentment wa improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry tree in the back yard fussing running through our list of drama based on the work of oliver optic victor appleton and edgar rice burroughs in this matter we were lucky to have dill he played the character part formerly thrust upon me the ape in tarzan mr crabtree in the rover boy mr damon in tom swift thus we came to know dill a a pocket merlin whose head teemed with eccentric plan strange longing and quaint fancy but by the end of august our repertoire wa vapid from countless reproduction and it wa then that dill gave u the idea of making boo radley come out the radley place fascinated dill in spite of our warning and explanation it drew him a the moon draw water but drew him no nearer than the light pole on the corner a safe distance from the radley gate there he would stand his arm around the fat pole staring and wondering the radley place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house walking south one faced it porch the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot the house wa low wa once white with a deep front porch and green shutter but had long ago darkened to the color of the slate gray yard around it rain rotted shingle drooped over the eaves of the veranda oak tree kept the sun away the remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard a swept yard that wa never swept where johnson grass and rabbit tobacco grew in abundance inside the house lived a malevolent phantom people said he existed but jem and i had never seen him people said he went out at night when the moon wa down and peeped in window when people s azalea froze in a cold snap it wa because he had breathed on them any stealthy small crime committed in maycomb were his work once the town wa terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal event people s chicken and household pet were found mutilated although the culprit wa crazy addie who eventually drowned himself in barker s eddy people still looked at the radley place unwilling to discard their initial suspicion a negro would not pas the radley place at night he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle a he walked the maycomb school ground adjoined the back of the radley lot from the radley chickenyard tall pecan tree shook their fruit into the schoolyard but the nut lay untouched by the child radley pecan would kill you a baseball hit into the radley yard wa a lost ball and no question asked the misery of that house began many year before jem and i were born the radleys welcome anywhere in town kept to themselves a predilection unforgivable in maycomb they did not go to church maycomb s principal recreation but worshiped at home mr radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a mid morning coffee break with her neighbor and certainly never joined a missionary circle mr radley walked to town at eleven thirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family grocery i never knew how old mr radley made his living jem said he bought cotton a polite term for doing nothing but mr radley and his wife had lived there with their two son a long a anybody could remember the shutter and door of the radley house were closed on sunday another thing alien to maycomb s way closed door meant illness and cold weather only of all day sunday wa the day for formal afternoon visiting lady wore corset men wore coat child wore shoe but to climb the radley front step and call he y of a sunday afternoon wa something their neighbor never did the radley house had no screen door i once asked atticus if it ever had any atticus said yes but before i wa born according to neighborhood legend when the younger radley boy wa in his teen he became acquainted with some of the cunningham from old sarum an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in maycomb they did little but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpit they hung around the barbershop they rode the bus to abbottsville on sunday and went to the picture show they attended dance at the county s riverside gambling hell the dew drop inn fishing camp they experimented with stumphole whiskey nobody in maycomb had nerve enough to tell mr radley that his boy wa in with the wrong crowd one night in an excessive spurt of high spirit the boy backed around the square in a borrowed flivver resisted arrest by maycomb s ancient beadle mr conner and locked him in the courthouse outhouse the town decided something had to be done mr conner said he knew who each and every one of them wa and he wa bound and determined they wouldn t get away with it so the boy came before the probate judge on charge of disorderly conduct disturbing the peace assault and battery and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female the judge asked mr conner why he included the last charge mr conner said they cussed so loud he wa sure every lady in maycomb heard them the judge decided to send the boy to the state industrial school where boy were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter it wa no prison and it wa no disgrace mr radley thought it wa if the judge released arthur mr radley would see to it that arthur gave no further trouble knowing that mr radley s word wa his bond the judge wa glad to do so the other boy attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at auburn the door of the radley house were closed on weekday a well a sunday and mr radley s boy wa not seen again for fifteen year but there came a day barely within jem s memory when boo radley wa heard from and wa seen by several people but not by jem he said atticus never talked much about the radleys when jem would question him atticus s only answer wa for him to mind his own business and let the radleys mind theirs they had a right to but when it happened jem said atticus shook his head and said mm mm mm so jem received most of his information from miss stephanie crawford a neighborhood scold who said she knew the whole thing according to miss stephanie boo wa sitting in the livingroom cutting some item from the maycomb tribune to paste in his scrapbook his father entered the room a mr radley passed by boo drove the scissors into his parent s leg pulled them out wiped them on his pant and resumed his activity mr radley ran screaming into the street that arthur wa killing them all but when the sheriff arrived he found boo still sitting in the livingroom cutting up the tribune he wa thirty three year old then miss stephanie said old mr radley said no radley wa going to any asylum when it wa suggested that a season in tuscaloosa might be helpful to boo boo wasn t crazy he wa high strung at time it wa all right to shut him up mr radley conceded but insisted that boo not be charged with anything he wa not a criminal the sheriff hadn t the heart to put him in jail alongside negro so boo wa locked in the courthouse basement boo s transition from the basement to back home wa nebulous in jem s memory miss stephanie crawford said some of the town council told mr radley that if he didn t take boo back boo would die of mold from the damp besides boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county nobody knew what form of intimidation mr radley employed to keep boo out of sight but jem figured that mr radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time atticus said no it wasn t that sort of thing that there were other way of making people into ghost my memory came alive to see mr radley occasionally open the front door walk to the edge of the porch and pour water on her canna but every day jem and i would see mr radley walking to and from town he wa a thin leathery man with colorless eye so colorless they did not reflect light his cheekbone were sharp and his mouth wa wide with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip miss stephanie crawford said he wa so upright he took the word of god a his only law and we believed her because mr radley s posture wa ramrod straight he never spoke to u when he passed we would look at the ground and say good morning sir and he would cough in reply mr radley s elder son lived in pensacola he came home at christmas and he wa one of the few person we ever saw enter or leave the place from the day mr radley took arthur home people said the house died but there came a day when atticus told u he d wear u out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of u mr radley wa dying he took his time about it wooden sawhorse blocked the road at each end of the radley lot straw wa put down on the sidewalk traffic wa diverted to the back street dr reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the radley s every time he called jem and i crept around the yard for day at last the sawhorse were taken away and we stood watching from the front porch when mr radley made his final journey past our house there go the meanest man ever god blew breath into murmured calpurnia and she spat meditatively into the yard we looked at her in surprise for calpurnia rarely commented on the way of white people the neighborhood thought when mr radley went under boo would come out but it had another think coming boo s elder brother returned from pensacola and took mr radley s place the only difference between him and his father wa their age jem said mr nathan radley bought cotton too mr nathan would speak to u however when we said good morning and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand the more we told dill about the radleys the more he wanted to know the longer he would stand hugging the light pole on the corner the more he would wonder wonder what he doe in there he would murmur look like he d just stick his head out the door jem said he go out all right when it s pitch dark miss stephanie crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her said his head wa like a skull lookin at her ain t you ever waked up at night and heard him dill he walk like this jem slid his foot through the gravel why do you think miss rachel lock up so tight at night i ve seen his track in our back yard many a mornin and one night i heard him scratching on the back screen but he wa gone time atticus got there wonder what he look like said dill jem gave a reasonable description of boo boo wa about six and a half foot tall judging from his track he dined on raw squirrel and any cat he could catch that s why his hand were bloodstained if you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off there wa a long jagged scar that ran across his face what teeth he had were yellow and rotten his eye popped and he drooled most of the time let s try to make him come out said dill i d like to see what he look like jem said if dill wanted to get himself killed all he had to do wa go up and knock on the front door our first raid came to pas only because dill bet jem the gray ghost against two tom swift that jem wouldn t get any farther than the radley gate in all his life jem had never declined a dare jem thought about it for three day i suppose he loved honor more than his head for dill wore him down easily you re scared dill said the first day ain t scared just respectful jem said the next day dill said you re too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard jem said he reckoned he wasn t he d passed the radley place every school day of his life always runnin i said but dill got him the third day when he told jem that folk in meridian certainly weren t a afraid a the folk in maycomb that he d never seen such scary folk a the one in maycomb this wa enough to make jem march to the corner where he stopped and leaned against the light pole watching the gate hanging crazily on it homemade hinge i hope you ve got it through your head that he ll kill u each and every one dill harris said jem when we joined him don t blame me when he gouge your eye out you started it remember you re still scared murmured dill patiently jem wanted dill to know once and for all that he wasn t scared of anything it s just that i can t think of a way to make him come out without him gettin u besides jem had his little sister to think of when he said that i knew he wa afraid jem had his little sister to think of the time i dared him to jump off the top of the house if i got killed what d become of you he asked then he jumped landed unhurt and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the radley place you gon na run out on a dare asked dill if you are then dill you have to think about these thing jem said lem me think a minute it s sort of like making a turtle come out how s that asked dill strike a match under him i told jem if he set fire to the radley house i wa going to tell atticus on him dill said striking a match under a turtle wa hateful ain t hateful just persuades him s not like you d chunk him in the fire jem growled how do you know a match don t hurt him turtle can t feel stupid said jem were you ever a turtle huh my star dill now lem me think reckon we can rock him jem stood in thought so long that dill made a mild concession i won t say you ran out on a dare an i ll swap you the gray ghost if you just go up and touch the house jem brightened touch the house that all dill nodded sure that s all now i don t want you hollerin something different the minute i get back yeah that s all said dill he ll probably come out after you when he see you in the yard then scout n me ll jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we ain t gon na hurt him we left the corner crossed the side street that ran in front of the radley house and stopped at the gate well go on said dill scout and me s right behind you i m going said jem don t hurry me he walked to the corner of the lot then back again studying the simple terrain a if deciding how best to effect an entry frowning and scratching his head then i sneered at him jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house slapped it with his palm and ran back past u not waiting to see if his foray wa successful dill and i followed on his heel safely on our porch panting and out of breath we looked back the old house wa the same droopy and sick but a we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move flick a tiny almost invisible movement and the house wa still content prev next chapter dill left u early in september to return to meridian we saw him off on the five o clock bus and i wa miserable without him until it occurred to me that i would be starting to school in a week i never looked forward more to anything in my life hour of wintertime had found me in the treehouse looking over at the schoolyard spying on multitude of child through a two power telescope jem had given me learning their game following jem s red jacket through wriggling circle of blind man s buff secretly sharing their misfortune and minor victory i longed to join them jem condescended to take me to school the first day a job usually done by one s parent but atticus had said jem would be delighted to show me where my room wa i think some money changed hand in this transaction for a we trotted around the corner past the radley place i heard an unfamiliar jingle in jem s pocket when we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard jem wa careful to explain that during school hour i wa not to bother him i wa not to approach him with request to enact a chapter of tarzan and the ant men to embarrass him with reference to his private life or tag along behind him at recess and noon i wa to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth in short i wa to leave him alone you mean we can t play any more i asked we ll do like we always do at home he said but you ll see school s different it certainly wa before the first morning wa over miss caroline fisher our teacher hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler then made me stand in the corner until noon miss caroline wa no more than twenty one she had bright auburn hair pink cheek and wore crimson fingernail polish she also wore high heeled pump and a red and white striped dress she looked and smelled like a peppermint drop she boarded across the street one door down from u in miss maudie atkinson s upstairs front room and when miss maudie introduced u to her jem wa in a haze for day miss caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said this say i am miss caroline fisher i am from north alabama from winston county the class murmured apprehensively should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarity indigenous to that region when alabama seceded from the union on january winston county seceded from alabama and every child in maycomb county knew it north alabama wa full of liquor interest big mule steel company republican professor and other person of no background miss caroline began the day by reading u a story about cat the cat had long conversation with one another they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove by the time mr cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mouse the class wa wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worm miss caroline seemed unaware that the ragged denim shirted and floursack skirted first grade most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hog from the time they were able to walk were immune to imaginative literature miss caroline came to the end of the story and said oh my wasn t that nice then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capital turned to the class and asked doe anybody know what these are everybody did most of the first grade had failed it last year i suppose she chose me because she knew my name a i read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrow and after making me read most of my first reader and the stock market quotation from the mobile register aloud she discovered that i wa literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste miss caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more it would interfere with my reading teach me i said in surprise he hasn t taught me anything miss caroline atticus ain t got time to teach me anything i added when miss caroline smiled and shook her head why he s so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and read if he didn t teach you who did miss caroline asked good naturedly somebody did you weren t born reading the mobile register jem say i wa he read in a book where i wa a bullfinch instead of a finch jem say my name s really jean louise bullfinch that i got swapped when i wa born and i m really a miss caroline apparently thought i wa lying let s not let our imagination run away with u dear she said now you tell your father not to teach you any more it s best to begin reading with a fresh mind you tell him i ll take over from here and try to undo the damage ma am your father doe not know how to teach you can have a seat now i mumbled that i wa sorry and retired meditating upon my crime i never deliberately learned to read but somehow i had been wallowing illicitly in the daily paper in the long hour of church wa it then i learned i could not remember not being able to read hymn now that i wa compelled to think about it reading wa something that just came to me a learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around or achieving two bow from a snarl of shoelace i could not remember when the line above atticus s moving finger separated into word but i had stared at them all the evening in my memory listening to the news of the day bill to be enacted into law the diary of lorenzo dow anything atticus happened to be reading when i crawled into his lap every night until i feared i would lose it i never loved to read one doe not love breathing i knew i had annoyed miss caroline so i let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when jem cut me from the covey of first grader in the schoolyard he asked how i wa getting along i told him if i didn t have to stay i d leave jem that damn lady say atticus s been teaching me to read and for him to stop it don t worry scout jem comforted me our teacher say miss caroline s introducing a new way of teaching she learned about it in college it ll be in all the grade soon you don t have to learn much out of book that way it s like if you wanta learn about cow you go milk one see yeah jem but i don t wanta study cow i sure you do you hafta know about cow they re a big part of life in maycomb county i contented myself with asking jem if he d lost his mind i m just trying to tell you the new way they re teachin the first grade stubborn it s the dewey decimal system having never questioned jem s pronouncement i saw no reason to begin now the dewey decimal system consisted in part of miss caroline waving card at u on which were printed the cat rat man and you no comment seemed to be expected of u and the class received these impressionistic revelation in silence i wa bored so i began a letter to dill miss caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me besides she said we don t write in the first grade we print you won t learn to write until you re in the third grade calpurnia wa to blame for this it kept me from driving her crazy on rainy day i guess she would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet then copying out a chapter of the bible beneath if i reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily she rewarded me with an open faced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar in calpurnia s teaching there wa no sentimentality i seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me everybody who go home to lunch hold up your hand said miss caroline breaking into my new grudge against calpurnia the town child did so and she looked u over everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk molasses bucket appeared from nowhere and the ceiling danced with metallic light miss caroline walked up and down the row peering and poking into lunch container nodding if the content pleased her frowning a little at others she stopped at walter cunningham s desk where s yours she asked walter cunningham s face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworm his absence of shoe told u how he got them people caught hookworm going barefooted in barnyard and hog wallow if walter had owned any shoe he would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until midwinter he did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overall did you forget your lunch this morning asked miss caroline walter looked straight ahead i saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw did you forget it this morning asked miss caroline walter s jaw twitched again yeb m he finally mumbled miss caroline went to her desk and opened her purse here s a quarter she said to walter go and eat downtown today you can pay me back tomorrow walter shook his head nome thank you ma am he drawled softly impatience crept into miss caroline s voice here walter come get it walter shook his head again when walter shook his head a third time someone whispered go on and tell her scout i turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation looking at me miss caroline and i had conferred twice already and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breed understanding i rose graciously on walter s behalf ah miss caroline what is it jean louise miss caroline he s a cunningham i sat back down what jean louise i thought i had made thing sufficiently clear it wa clear enough to the rest of u walter cunningham wa sitting there lying his head off he didn t forget his lunch he didn t have any he had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day he had probably never seen three quarter together at the same time in his life i tried again walter s one of the cunningham miss caroline i beg your pardon jean louise that s okay ma am you ll get to know all the county folk after a while the cunningham never took anything they can t pay back no church basket and no scrip stamp they never took anything off of anybody they get along on what they have they don t have much but they get along on it my special knowledge of the cunningham tribe one branch that is wa gained from event of last winter walter s father wa one of atticus s client after a dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment before mr cunningham left he said mr finch i don t know when i ll ever be able to pay you let that be the least of your worry walter atticus said when i asked jem what entailment wa and jem described it a a condition of having your tail in a crack i asked atticus if mr cunningham would ever pay u not in money atticus said but before the year s out i ll have been paid you watch we watched one morning jem and i found a load of stovewood in the back yard later a sack of hickory nut appeared on the back step with christmas came a crate of smilax and holly that spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip green atticus said mr cunningham had more than paid him why doe he pay you like that i asked because that s the only way he can pay me he ha no money are we poor atticus atticus nodded we are indeed jem s nose wrinkled are we a poor a the cunningham not exactly the cunningham are country folk farmer and the crash hit them hardest atticus said professional people were poor because the farmer were poor a maycomb county wa farm country nickel and dime were hard to come by for doctor and dentist and lawyer entailment wa only a part of mr cunningham s vexation the acre not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt and the little cash he made went to interest if he held his mouth right mr cunningham could get a wpa job but his land would go to ruin if he left it and he wa willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote a he pleased mr cunningham said atticus came from a set breed of men a the cunningham had no money to pay a lawyer they simply paid u with what they had did you know said atticus that dr reynolds work the same way he charge some folk a bushel of potato for delivery of a baby miss scout if you give me your attention i ll tell you what entailment is jem s definition are very nearly accurate sometimes if i could have explained these thing to miss caroline i would have saved myself some inconvenience and miss caroline subsequent mortification but it wa beyond my ability to explain thing a well a atticus so i said you re shamin him miss caroline walter hasn t got a quarter at home to bring you and you can t use any stovewood miss caroline stood stock still then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk jean louise i ve had about enough of you this morning she said you re starting off on the wrong foot in every way my dear hold out your hand i thought she wa going to spit in it which wa the only reason anybody in maycomb held out his hand it wa a time honored method of sealing oral contract wondering what bargain we had made i turned to the class for an answer but the class looked back at me in puzzlement miss caroline picked up her ruler gave me half a dozen quick little pat then told me to stand in the corner a storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that miss caroline had whipped me when miss caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again becoming cold sober only when the shadow of miss blount fell over them miss blount a native maycombian a yet uninitiated in the mystery of the decimal system appeared at the door hand on hip and announced if i hear another sound from this room i ll burn up everybody in it miss caroline the sixth grade can not concentrate on the pyramid for all this racket my sojourn in the corner wa a short one saved by the bell miss caroline watched the class file out for lunch a i wa the last to leave i saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her arm had her conduct been more friendly toward me i would have felt sorry for her she wa a pretty little thing content prev next chapter catching walter cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure but when i wa rubbing his nose in the dirt jem came by and told me to stop you re bigger n he is he said he s a old a you nearly i said he made me start off on the wrong foot let him go scout why he didn t have any lunch i said and explained my involvement in walter s dietary affair walter had picked himself up and wa standing quietly listening to jem and me his fist were half cocked a if expecting an onslaught from both of u i stomped at him to chase him away but jem put out his hand and stopped me he examined walter with an air of speculation your daddy mr walter cunningham from old sarum he asked and walter nodded walter looked a if he had been raised on fish food his eye a blue a dill harris s were red rimmed and watery there wa no color in his face except at the tip of his nose which wa moistly pink he fingered the strap of his overall nervously picking at the metal hook jem suddenly grinned at him come on home to dinner with u walter he said we d be glad to have you walter s face brightened then darkened jem said our daddy s a friend of your daddy s scout here she s crazy she won t fight you any more i wouldn t be too certain of that i said jem s free dispensation of my pledge irked me but precious noontime minute were ticking away yeah walter i won t jump on you again don t you like butterbean our cal s a real good cook walter stood where he wa biting his lip jem and i gave up and we were nearly to the radley place when walter called hey i m comin when walter caught up with u jem made pleasant conversation with him a hain t life there he said cordially pointing to the radley house ever hear about him walter reckon i have said walter almost died first year i come to school and et them pecan folk say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the fence jem seemed to have little fear of boo radley now that walter and i walked beside him indeed jem grew boastful i went all the way up to the house once he said to walter anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he pass it i said to the cloud above and who s runnin miss priss you are when ain t anybody with you by the time we reached our front step walter had forgotten he wa a cunningham jem ran to the kitchen and asked calpurnia to set an extra plate we had company atticus greeted walter and began a discussion about crop neither jem nor i could follow reason i can t pas the first grade mr finch is i ve had to stay out ever spring an help papa with the choppin but there s another n at the house now that s field size did you pay a bushel of potato for him i asked but atticus shook his head at me while walter piled food on his plate he and atticus talked together like two men to the wonderment of jem and me atticus wa expounding upon farm problem when walter interrupted to ask if there wa any molasses in the house atticus summoned calpurnia who returned bearing the syrup pitcher she stood waiting for walter to help himself walter poured syrup on his vegetable and meat with a generous hand he would probably have poured it into his milk glass had i not asked what the sam hill he wa doing the silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher and he quickly put his hand in his lap then he ducked his head atticus shook his head at me again but he s gone and drowned his dinner in syrup i protested he s poured it all over it wa then that calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen she wa furious and when she wa furious calpurnia s grammar became erratic when in tranquility her grammar wa a good a anybody s in maycomb atticus said calpurnia had more education than most colored folk when she squinted down at me the tiny line around her eye deepened there s some folk who don t eat like u she whispered fiercely but you ain t called on to contradict em at the table when they don t that boy s yo comp ny and if he want to eat up the table cloth you let him you hear he ain t company cal he s just a cunningham hush your mouth don t matter who they are anybody set foot in this house s yo comp ny and don t you let me catch you remarkin on their way like you wa so high and mighty yo folk might be better n the cunningham but it don t count for nothin the way you re disgracin em if you can t act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack i retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen thankful though that i wa spared the humiliation of facing them again i told calpurnia to just wait i d fix her one of these day when she wasn t looking i d go off and drown myself in barker s eddy and then she d be sorry besides i added she d already gotten me in trouble once today she had taught me to write and it wa all her fault hush your fussin she said jem and walter returned to school ahead of me staying behind to advise atticus of calpurnia s iniquity wa worth a solitary sprint past the radley place she like jem better n she like me anyway i concluded and suggested that atticus lose no time in packing her off have you ever considered that jem doesn t worry her half a much atticus s voice wa flinty i ve no intention of getting rid of her now or ever we couldn t operate a single day without cal have you ever thought of that you think about how much cal doe for you and you mind her you hear i returned to school and hated calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered my resentment i looked up to see miss caroline standing in the middle of the room sheer horror flooding her face apparently she had revived enough to persevere in her profession it s alive she screamed the male population of the class rushed a one to her assistance lord i thought she s scared of a mouse little chuck little whose patience with all living thing wa phenomenal said which way did he go miss caroline tell u where he went quick d c he turned to a boy behind him d c shut the door and we ll catch him quick ma am where d he go miss caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk but to a hulking individual unknown to me little chuck s face contracted and he said gently you mean him ma am yessum he s alive did he scare you some way miss caroline said desperately i wa just walking by when it crawled out of his hair just crawled out of his hair little chuck grinned broadly there ain t no need to fear a cootie ma am ain t you ever seen one now don t you be afraid you just go back to your desk and teach u some more little chuck little wa another member of the population who didn t know where his next meal wa coming from but he wa a born gentleman he put his hand under her elbow and led miss caroline to the front of the room now don t you fret ma am he said there ain t no need to fear a cootie i ll just fetch you some cool water the cootie s host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought he searched the scalp above his forehead located his guest and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger miss caroline watched the process in horrid fascination little chuck brought water in a paper cup and she drank it gratefully finally she found her voice what is your name son she asked softly the boy blinked who me miss caroline nodded burris ewell miss caroline inspected her roll book i have a ewell here but i don t have a first name would you spell your first name for me don t know how they call me burris t home well burris said miss caroline i think we d better excuse you for the rest of the afternoon i want you to go home and wash your hair from her desk she produced a thick volume leafed through it page and read for a moment a good home remedy for burris i want you to go home and wash your hair with lye soap when you ve done that treat your scalp with kerosene what fer missus to get rid of the er cootie you see burris the other child might catch them and you wouldn t want that would you the boy stood up he wa the filthiest human i had ever seen his neck wa dark gray the back of his hand were rusty and his fingernail were black deep into the quick he peered at miss caroline from a fist sized clean space on his face no one had noticed him probably because miss caroline and i had entertained the class most of the morning and burris said miss caroline please bathe yourself before you come back tomorrow the boy laughed rudely you ain t sendin me home missus i wa on the verge of leavin i done done my time for this year miss caroline looked puzzled what do you mean by that the boy did not answer he gave a short contemptuous snort one of the elderly member of the class answered her he s one of the ewells ma am and i wondered if this explanation would be a unsuccessful a my attempt but miss caroline seemed willing to listen whole school s full of em they come first day every year and then leave the truant lady get em here cause she threatens em with the sheriff but she s give up tryin to hold em she reckons she s carried out the law just gettin their name on the roll and runnin em here the first day you re supposed to mark em absent the rest of the year but what about their parent asked miss caroline in genuine concern ain t got no mother wa the answer and their paw s right contentious burris ewell wa flattered by the recital been comin to the first day o the first grade fer three year now he said expansively reckon if i m smart this year they ll promote me to the second miss caroline said sit back down please burris and the moment she said it i knew she had made a serious mistake the boy s condescension flashed to anger you try and make me missus little chuck little got to his foot let him go ma am he said he s a mean one a hard down mean one he s liable to start somethin and there s some little folk here he wa among the most diminutive of men but when burris ewell turned toward him little chuck s right hand went to his pocket watch your step burris he said i d soon s kill you a look at you now go home burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height and miss caroline took advantage of his indecision burris go home if you don t i ll call the principal she said i ll have to report this anyway the boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door safely out of range he turned and shouted report and be damned to ye ain t no snot nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c n make me do nothin you ain t makin me go nowhere missus you just remember that you ain t makin me go nowhere he waited until he wa sure she wa cry then he shuffled out of the building soon we were clustered around her desk trying in our various way to comfort her he wa a real mean one below the belt you ain t called on to teach folk like that them ain t maycomb s way miss caroline not really now don t you fret ma am miss caroline why don t you read u a story that cat thing wa real fine this mornin miss caroline smiled blew her nose said thank you darling dispersed u opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in a hall when i passed the radley place for the fourth time that day twice at a full gallop my gloom had deepened to match the house if the remainder of the school year were a fraught with drama a the first day perhaps it would be mildly entertaining but the prospect of spending nine month refraining from reading and writing made me think of running away by late afternoon most of my traveling plan were complete when jem and i raced each other up the sidewalk to meet atticus coming home from work i didn t give him much of a race it wa our habit to run meet atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace he wa full of question about school my reply were monosyllabic and he did not press me perhaps calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one she let me watch her fix supper shut your eye and open your mouth and i ll give you a surprise she said it wa not often that she made crackling bread she said she never had time but with both of u at school today had been an easy one for her she knew i loved crackling bread i missed you today she said the house got so lonesome long about two o clock i had to turn on the radio why jem n me ain t ever in the house unless it s rainin i know she said but one of you s always in callin distance i wonder how much of the day i spend just callin after you well she said getting up from the kitchen chair it s enough time to make a pan of cracklin bread i reckon you run along now and let me get supper on the table calpurnia bent down and kissed me i ran along wondering what had come over her she had wanted to make up with me that wa it she had always been too hard on me she had at last seen the error of her fractious way she wa sorry and too stubborn to say so i wa weary from the day s crime after supper atticus sat down with the paper and called scout ready to read the lord sent me more than i could bear and i went to the front porch atticus followed me something wrong scout i told atticus i didn t feel very well and didn t think i d go to school any more if it wa all right with him atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his leg his finger wandered to his watchpocket he said that wa the only way he could think he waited in amiable silence and i sought to reinforce my position you never went to school and you do all right so i ll just stay home too you can teach me like granddaddy taught you n uncle jack no i can t said atticus i have to make a living besides they d put me in jail if i kept you at home dose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow i m feeling all right really thought so now what s the matter bit by bit i told him the day s misfortune and she said you taught me all wrong so we can t ever read any more ever please don t send me back please sir atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch when he completed his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me first of all he said if you can learn a simple trick scout you ll get along a lot better with all kind of folk you never really understand a person until you consider thing from his point of view sir until you climb into his skin and walk around in it atticus said i had learned many thing today and miss caroline had learned several thing herself she had learned not to hand something to a cunningham for one thing but if walter and i had put ourselves in her shoe we d have seen it wa an honest mistake on her part we could not expect her to learn all maycomb s way in one day and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better i ll be dogged i said i didn t know no better than not to read to her and she held me responsible listen atticus i don t have to go to school i wa bursting with a sudden thought burris ewell remember he just go to school the first day the truant lady reckons she s carried out the law when she get his name on the roll you can t do that scout atticus said sometimes it s better to bend the law a little in special case in your case the law remains rigid so to school you must go i don t see why i have to when he doesn t then listen atticus said the ewells had been the disgrace of maycomb for three generation none of them had done an honest day s work in his recollection he said that some christmas when he wa getting rid of the tree he would take me with him and show me where and how they lived they were people but they lived like animal they can go to school any time they want to when they show the faintest symptom of wanting an education said atticus there are way of keeping them in school by force but it s silly to force people like the ewells into a new environment if i didn t go to school tomorrow you d force me to let u leave it at this said atticus dryly you miss scout finch are of the common folk you must obey the law he said that the ewells were member of an exclusive society made up of ewells in certain circumstance the common folk judiciously allowed them certain privilege by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the ewells activity they didn t have to go to school for one thing another thing mr bob ewell burris s father wa permitted to hunt and trap out of season atticus that s bad i said in maycomb county hunting out of season wa a misdemeanor at law a capital felony in the eye of the populace it s against the law all right said my father and it s certainly bad but when a man spends his relief check on green whiskey his child have a way of cry from hunger pain i don t know of any landowner around here who begrudges those child any game their father can hit mr ewell shouldn t do that of course he shouldn t but he ll never change his way are you going to take out your disapproval on his child no sir i murmured and made a final stand but if i keep on goin to school we can t ever read any more that s really bothering you isn t it yes sir when atticus looked down at me i saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something do you know what a compromise is he asked bending the law no an agreement reached by mutual concession it work this way he said if you ll concede the necessity of going to school we ll go on reading every night just a we always have is it a bargain yes sir we ll consider it sealed without the usual formality atticus said when he saw me preparing to spit a i opened the front screen door atticus said by the way scout you d better not say anything at school about our agreement why not i m afraid our activity would be received with considerable disapprobation by the more learned authority jem and i were accustomed to our father s last will and testament diction and we were at all time free to interrupt atticus for a translation when it wa beyond our understanding huh sir i never went to school he said but i have a feeling that if you tell miss caroline we read every night she ll get after me and i wouldn t want her after me atticus kept u in fit that evening gravely reading column of print about a man who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason which wa reason enough for jem to spend the following saturday aloft in the treehouse jem sat from after breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not atticus severed his supply line i had spent most of the day climbing up and down running errand for him providing him with literature nourishment and water and wa carrying him blanket for the night when atticus said if i paid no attention to him jem would come down atticus wa right content prev next chapter the remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first indeed they were an endless project that slowly evolved into a unit in which mile of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the state of alabama in it well meaning but fruitless effort to teach me group dynamic what jem called the dewey decimal system wa school wide by the end of my first year so i had no chance to compare it with other teaching technique i could only look around me atticus and my uncle who went to school at home knew everything at least what one didn t know the other did furthermore i couldn t help noticing that my father had served for year in the state legislature elected each time without opposition innocent of the adjustment my teacher thought essential to the development of good citizenship jem educated on a half decimal halfduncecap basis seemed to function effectively alone or in a group but jem wa a poor example no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at book a for me i knew nothing except what i gathered from time magazine and reading everything i could lay hand on at home but a i inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the maycomb county school system i could not help receiving the impression that i wa being cheated out of something out of what i knew not yet i did not believe that twelve year of unrelieved boredom wa exactly what the state had in mind for me a the year passed released from school thirty minute before jem who had to stay until three o clock i ran by the radley place a fast a i could not stopping until i reached the safety of our front porch one afternoon a i raced by something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that i took a deep breath a long look around and went back two live oak stood at the edge of the radley lot their root reached out into the side road and made it bumpy something about one of the tree attracted my attention some tinfoil wa sticking in a knot hole just above my eye level winking at me in the afternoon sun i stood on tiptoe hastily looked around once more reached into the hole and withdrew two piece of chewing gum minus their outer wrapper my first impulse wa to get it into my mouth a quickly a possible but i remembered where i wa i ran home and on our front porch i examined my loot the gum looked fresh i sniffed it and it smelled all right i licked it and waited for a while when i did not die i crammed it into my mouth wrigley s doublemint when jem came home he asked me where i got such a wad i told him i found it don t eat thing you find scout this wasn t on the ground it wa in a tree jem growled well it wa i said it wa sticking in that tree yonder the one comin from school spit it out right now i spat it out the tang wa fading anyway i ve been chewin it all afternoon and i ain t dead yet not even sick jem stamped his foot don t you know you re not supposed to even touch the tree over there you ll get killed if you do you touched the house once that wa different you go gargle right now you hear me ain t neither it ll take the taste outa my mouth you don t n i ll tell calpurnia on you rather than risk a tangle with calpurnia i did a jem told me for some reason my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship calpurnia s tyranny unfairness and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumbling of general disapproval on my part i went to much trouble sometimes not to provoke her summer wa on the way jem and i awaited it with impatience summer wa our best season it wa sleeping on the back screened porch in cot or trying to sleep in the treehouse summer wa everything good to eat it wa a thousand color in a parched landscape but most of all summer wa dill the authority released u early the last day of school and jem and i walked home together reckon old dill ll be coming home tomorrow i said probably day after said jem mi sippi turn em loose a day later a we came to the live oak at the radley place i raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knot hole where i had found the chewing gum trying to make jem believe i had found it there and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil i see it scout i see it jem looked around reached up and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package we ran home and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bit of tinfoil collected from chewing gum wrapper it wa the kind of box wedding ring came in purple velvet with a minute catch jem flicked open the tiny catch inside were two scrubbed and polished penny one on top of the other jem examined them indian head he said nineteen six and scout one of em s nineteen hundred these are real old nineteen hundred i echoed say hush a minute i m thinkin jem you reckon that s somebody s hidin place naw don t anybody much but u pas by there unless it s some grown person s grown folk don t have hidin place you reckon we ought to keep em jem i don t know what we could do scout who d we give em back to i know for a fact don t anybody go by there cecil go by the back street an all the way around by town to get home cecil jacob who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the radley place and old mr henry lafayette dubose mr dubose lived two door up the street from u neighborhood opinion wa unanimous that mr dubose wa the meanest old woman who ever lived jem wouldn t go by her place without atticus beside him what you reckon we oughta do jem finder were keeper unless title wa proven plucking an occasional camellia getting a squirt of hot milk from miss maudie atkinson s cow on a summer day helping ourselves to someone s scuppernong wa part of our ethical culture but money wa different tell you what said jem we ll keep em till school start then go around and ask everybody if they re theirs they re some bus child s maybe he wa too taken up with gettin outa school today an forgot em these are somebody s i know that see how they ve been slicked up they ve been saved yeah but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that you know it doesn t last i don t know scout but these are important to somebody how s that jem well indian head well they come from the indian they re real strong magic they make you have good luck not like fried chicken when you re not lookin for it but thing like long life n good health n passin six week test these are real valuable to somebody i m gon na put em in my trunk before jem went to his room he looked for a long time at the radley place he seemed to be thinking again two day later dill arrived in a blaze of glory he had ridden the train by himself from meridian to maycomb junction a courtesy title maycomb junction wa in abbott county where he had been met by miss rachel in maycomb s one taxi he had eaten dinner in the diner he had seen two twin hitched together get off the train in bay st louis and stuck to his story regardless of threat he had discarded the abominable blue short that were buttoned to his shirt and wore real short pant with a belt he wa somewhat heavier no taller and said he had seen his father dill s father wa taller than ours he had a black beard pointed and wa president of the l n railroad i helped the engineer for a while said dill yawning in a pig s ear you did dill hush said jem what ll we play today tom and sam and dick said dill let s go in the front yard dill wanted the rover boy because there were three respectable part he wa clearly tired of being our character man i m tired of those i said i wa tired of playing tom rover who suddenly lost his memory in the middle of a picture show and wa out of the script until the end when he wa found in alaska make u up one jem i said i m tired of makin em up our first day of freedom and we were tired i wondered what the summer would bring we had strolled to the front yard where dill stood looking down the street at the dreary face of the radley place i smell death he said i do i mean it he said when i told him to shut up you mean when somebody s dyin you can smell it no i mean i can smell somebody an tell if they re gon na die an old lady taught me how dill leaned over and sniffed me jean louise finch you are going to die in three day dill if you don t hush i ll knock you bowlegged i mean it now yawl hush growled jem you act like you believe in hot steam you act like you don t i said what s a hot steam asked dill haven t you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place jem asked dill a hot steam s somebody who can t get to heaven just wallow around on lonesome road an if you walk through him when you die you ll be one too an you ll go around at night suckin people s breath how can you keep from passing through one you can t said jem sometimes they stretch all the way across the road but if you hafta go through one you say angel bright life in death get off the road don t suck my breath that keep em from wrapping around you don t you believe a word he say dill i said calpurnia say that s niggertalk jem scowled darkly at me but said well are we gon na play anything or not let s roll in the tire i suggested jem sighed you know i m too big you c n push i ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house i slapped it up to the front yard i m first i said dill said he ought to be first he just got here jem arbitrated awarded me first push with an extra time for dill and i folded myself inside the tire until it happened i did not realize that jem wa offended by my contradicting him on hot steam and that he wa patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me he did by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body ground sky and house melted into a mad palette my ear throbbed i wa suffocating i could not put out my hand to stop they were wedged between my chest and knee i could only hope that jem would outrun the tire and me or that i would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk i heard him behind me chasing and shouting the tire bumped on gravel skeetered across the road crashed into a barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement dizzy and nauseated i lay on the cement and shook my head still pounded my ear to silence and heard jem s voice scout get away from there come on i raised my head and stared at the radley place step in front of me i froze come on scout don t just lie there jem wa screaming get up can tcha i got to my foot trembling a i thawed get the tire jem hollered bring it with you ain t you got any sense at all when i wa able to navigate i ran back to them a fast a my shaking knee would carry me why didn t you bring it jem yelled why don t you get it i screamed jem wa silent go on it ain t far inside the gate why you even touched the house once remember jem looked at me furiously could not decline ran down the sidewalk treaded water at the gate then dashed in and retrieved the tire see there jem wa scowling triumphantly nothin to it i swear scout sometimes you act so much like a girl it s mortifyin there wa more to it than he knew but i decided not to tell him calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled lemonade time you all get in outa that hot sun fore you fry alive lemonade in the middle of the morning wa a summertime ritual calpurnia set a pitcher and three glass on the porch then went about her business being out of jem s good grace did not worry me especially lemonade would restore his good humor jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest i know what we are going to play he announced something new something different what asked dill boo radley jem s head at time wa transparent he had thought that up to make me understand he wasn t afraid of radleys in any shape or form to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice boo radley how asked dill jem said scout you can be mr radley i declare if i will i don t think smatter said dill still scared he can get out at night when we re all asleep i said jem hissed scout how s he gon na know what we re doin besides i don t think he s still there he died year ago and they stuffed him up the chimney dill said jem you and me can play and scout can watch if she s scared i wa fairly sure boo radley wa inside that house but i couldn t prove it and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or i would be accused of believing in hot steam phenomenon i wa immune to in the daytime jem parceled out our role i wa mr radley and all i had to do wa come out and sweep the porch dill wa old mr radley he walked up and down the sidewalk and coughed when jem spoke to him jem naturally wa boo he went under the front step and shrieked and howled from time to time a the summer progressed so did our game we polished and perfected it added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang change every day dill wa a villain s villain he could get into any character part assigned him and appear tall if height wa part of the devilry required he wa a good a his worst performance his worst performance wa gothic i reluctantly played assorted lady who entered the script i never thought it a much fun a tarzan and i played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite jem s assurance that boo radley wa dead and nothing would get me with him and calpurnia there in the daytime and atticus home at night jem wa a born hero it wa a melancholy little drama woven from bit and scrap of gossip and neighborhood legend mr radley had been beautiful until she married mr radley and lost all her money she also lost most of her teeth her hair and her right forefinger dill s contribution boo bit it off one night when he couldn t find any cat and squirrel to eat she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time while boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house the three of u were the boy who got into trouble i wa the probate judge for a change dill led jem away and crammed him beneath the step poking him with the brushbroom jem would reappear a needed in the shape of the sheriff assorted townsfolk and miss stephanie crawford who had more to say about the radleys than anybody in maycomb when it wa time to play boo s big scene jem would sneak into the house steal the scissors from the sewing machine drawer when calpurnia s back wa turned then sit in the swing and cut up newspaper dill would walk by cough at jem and jem would fake a plunge into dill s thigh from where i stood it looked real when mr nathan radley passed u on his daily trip to town we would stand still and silent until he wa out of sight then wonder what he would do to u if he suspected our activity halted when any of the neighbor appeared and once i saw miss maudie atkinson staring across the street at u her hedge clipper poised in midair one day we were so busily playing chapter xxv book ii of one man s family we did not see atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at u slapping a rolled magazine against his knee the sun said twelve noon what are you all playing he asked nothing said jem jem s evasion told me our game wa a secret so i kept quiet what are you doing with those scissors then why are you tearing up that newspaper if it s today s i ll tan you nothing nothing what said atticus nothing sir give me those scissors atticus said they re no thing to play with doe this by any chance have anything to do with the radleys no sir said jem reddening i hope it doesn t he said shortly and went inside the house je m shut up he s gone in the livingroom he can hear u in there safely in the yard dill asked jem if we could play any more i don t know atticus didn t say we couldn t jem i said i think atticus know it anyway no he don t if he did he d say he did i wa not so sure but jem told me i wa being a girl that girl always imagined thing that s why other people hated them so and if i started behaving like one i could just go off and find some to play with all right you just keep it up then i said you ll find out atticus s arrival wa the second reason i wanted to quit the game the first reason happened the day i rolled into the radley front yard through all the head shaking quelling of nausea and jem yelling i had heard another sound so low i could not have heard it from the sidewalk someone inside the house wa laughing content prev next chapter my nagging got the better of jem eventually a i knew it would and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while he still maintained however that atticus hadn t said we couldn t therefore we could and if atticus ever said we couldn t jem had thought of a way around it he would simply change the name of the character and then we couldn t be accused of playing anything dill wa in hearty agreement with this plan of action dill wa becoming something of a trial anyway following jem about he had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him then he promptly forgot about it he staked me out marked a his property said i wa the only girl he would ever love then he neglected me i beat him up twice but it did no good he only grew closer to jem they spent day together in the treehouse plotting and planning calling me only when they needed a third party but i kept aloof from their more foolhardy scheme for a while and on pain of being called a girl i spent most of the remaining twilight that summer sitting with miss maudie atkinson on her front porch jem and i had always enjoyed the free run of miss maudie s yard if we kept out of her azalea but our contact with her wa not clearly defined until jem and dill excluded me from their plan she wa only another lady in the neighborhood but a relatively benign presence our tacit treaty with miss maudie wa that we could play on her lawn eat her scuppernong if we didn t jump on the arbor and explore her vast back lot term so generous we seldom spoke to her so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship but jem and dill drove me closer to her with their behavior miss maudie hated her house time spent indoors wa time wasted she wa a widow a chameleon lady who worked in her flower bed in an old straw hat and men s coverall but after her five o clock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty she loved everything that grew in god s earth even the weed with one exception if she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it wa like the second battle of the marne she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blast from beneath with a poisonous substance she said wa so powerful it d kill u all if we didn t stand out of the way why can t you just pull it up i asked after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inch high pull it up child pull it up she picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up it tiny stalk microscopic grain oozed out why one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard look here when it come fall this dry up and the wind blow it all over maycomb county miss maudie s face likened such an occurrence unto an old testament pestilence her speech wa crisp for a maycomb county inhabitant she called u by all our name and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prong clipped to her eyetooth when i admired them and hoped i would have some eventually she said look here with a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship miss maudie s benevolence extended to jem and dill whenever they paused in their pursuit we reaped the benefit of a talent miss maudie had hitherto kept hidden from u she made the best cake in the neighborhood when she wa admitted into our confidence every time she baked she made a big cake and three little one and she would call across the street jem finch scout finch charles baker harris come here our promptness wa always rewarded in summertime twilight are long and peaceful often a not miss maudie and i would sit silently on her porch watching the sky go from yellow to pink a the sun went down watching flight of martin sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftop miss maudie i said one evening do you think boo radley s still alive his name s arthur and he s alive she said she wa rocking slowly in her big oak chair do you smell my mimosa it s like angel breath this evening yessum how do you know know what child that b mr arthur s still alive what a morbid question but i suppose it s a morbid subject i know he s alive jean louise because i haven t seen him carried out yet maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney where did you get such a notion that s what jem said he thought they did s s s he get more like jack finch every day miss maudie had known uncle jack finch atticus s brother since they were child nearly the same age they had grown up together at finch s landing miss maudie wa the daughter of a neighboring landowner dr frank buford dr buford s profession wa medicine and his obsession wa anything that grew in the ground so he stayed poor uncle jack finch confined his passion for digging to his window box in nashville and stayed rich we saw uncle jack every christmas and every christmas he yelled across the street for miss maudie to come marry him miss maudie would yell back call a little louder jack finch and they ll hear you at the post office i haven t heard you yet jem and i thought this a strange way to ask for a lady s hand in marriage but then uncle jack wa rather strange he said he wa trying to get miss maudie s goat that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty year that he wa the last person in the world miss maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing and the best defense to her wa spirited offense all of which we understood clearly arthur radley just stay in the house that s all said miss maudie wouldn t you stay in the house if you didn t want to come out yessum but i d wanta come out why doesn t he miss maudie s eye narrowed you know that story a well a i do i never heard why though nobody ever told me why miss maudie settled her bridgework you know old mr radley wa a footwashing baptist that s what you are ain t it my shell s not that hard child i m just a baptist don t you all believe in foot washing we do at home in the bathtub but we can t have communion with you all apparently deciding that it wa easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion miss maudie said foot washer believe anything that s pleasure is a sin did you know some of em came out of the wood one saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flower were going to hell your flower too yes ma am they d burn right with me they thought i spent too much time in god s outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the bible my confidence in pulpit gospel lessened at the vision of miss maudie stewing forever in various protestant hell true enough she had an acid tongue in her head and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good a did miss stephanie crawford but while no one with a grain of sense trusted miss stephanie jem and i had considerable faith in miss maudie she had never told on u had never played cat and mouse with u she wa not at all interested in our private life she wa our friend how so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment wa incomprehensible that ain t right miss maudie you re the best lady i know miss maudie grinned thank you ma am thing is foot washer think woman are a sin by definition they take the bible literally you know is that why mr arthur stay in the house to keep away from woman i ve no idea it doesn t make sense to me look like if mr arthur wa hankerin after heaven he d come out on the porch at least atticus say god s loving folk like you love yourself miss maudie stopped rocking and her voice hardened you are too young to understand it she said but sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of oh of your father i wa shocked atticus doesn t drink whiskey i said he never drunk a drop in his life nome yes he did he said he drank some one time and didn t like it miss maudie laughed wasn t talking about your father she said what i meant wa if atticus finch drank until he wa drunk he wouldn t be a hard a some men are at their best there are just some kind of men who who re so busy worrying about the next world they ve never learned to live in this one and you can look down the street and see the result do you think they re true all those thing they say about b mr arthur what thing i told her that is three fourth colored folk and one fourth stephanie crawford said miss maudie grimly stephanie crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her i said what did you do stephanie move over in the bed and make room for him that shut her up a while i wa sure it did miss maudie s voice wa enough to shut anybody up no child she said that is a sad house i remember arthur radley when he wa a boy he always spoke nicely to me no matter what folk said he did spoke a nicely a he knew how you reckon he s crazy miss maudie shook her head if he s not he should be by now the thing that happen to people we never really know what happens in house behind closed door what secret atticus don t ever do anything to jem and me in the house that he don t do in the yard i said feeling it my duty to defend my parent gracious child i wa raveling a thread wasn t even thinking about your father but now that i am i ll say this atticus finch is the same in his house a he is on the public street how d you like some fresh poundcake to take home i liked it very much next morning when i awakened i found jem and dill in the back yard deep in conversation when i joined them a usual they said go away will not this yard s a much mine a it is yours jem finch i got just a much right to play in it a you have dill and jem emerged from a brief huddle if you stay you ve got to do what we tell you dill warned we ll i said who s so high and mighty all of a sudden if you don t say you ll do what we tell you we ain t gon na tell you anything dill continued you act like you grew ten inch in the night all right what is it jem said placidly we are going to give a note to boo radley just how i wa trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me it wa all right for miss maudie to talk she wa old and snug on her porch it wa different for u jem wa merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutter if anyone came along dill would ring the bell dill raised his right hand in it wa my mother s silver dinner bell i m goin around to the side of the house said jem we looked yesterday from across the street and there s a shutter loose think maybe i can make it stick on the window sill at least jem now you re in it and you can t get out of it you ll just stay in it miss priss okay okay but i don t wanta watch jem somebody wa yes you will you ll watch the back end of the lot and dill s gon na watch the front of the house an up the street an if anybody come he ll ring the bell that clear all right then what d you write him dill said we re askin him real politely to come out sometimes and tell u what he doe in there we said we wouldn t hurt him and we d buy him an ice cream you all ve gone crazy he ll kill u dill said it s my idea i figure if he d come out and sit a spell with u he might feel better how do you know he don t feel good well how d you feel if you d been shut up for a hundred year with nothin but cat to eat i bet he s got a beard down to here like your daddy s he ain t got a beard he dill stopped a if trying to remember uh huh caughtcha i said you said fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard if it s all the same to you he shaved it off last summer yeah an i ve got the letter to prove it he sent me two dollar too keep on i reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform that n never showed up did it you just keep on tellin em son dill harris could tell the biggest one i ever heard among other thing he had been up in a mail plane seventeen time he had been to nova scotia he had seen an elephant and his granddaddy wa brigadier general joe wheeler and left him his sword you all hush said jem he scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk anybody who s brave enough to go up and touch the house hadn t oughta use a fishin pole i said why don t you just knock the front door down this is different said jem how many time do i have to tell you that dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to jem the three of u walked cautiously toward the old house dill remained at the light pole on the front corner of the lot and jem and i edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house i walked beyond jem and stood where i could see around the curve all clear i said not a soul in sight jem looked up the sidewalk to dill who nodded jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected the pole lacked several inch of being long enough and jem leaned over a far a he could i watched him making jabbing motion for so long i abandoned my post and went to him can t get it off the pole he muttered or if i got it off i can t make it stay g on back down the street scout i returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road occasionally i looked back at jem who wa patiently trying to place the note on the window sill it would flutter to the ground and jem would jab it up until i thought if boo radley ever received it he wouldn t be able to read it i wa looking down the street when the dinner bell rang shoulder up i reeled around to face boo radley and his bloody fang instead i saw dill ringing the bell with all his might in atticus s face jem looked so awful i didn t have the heart to tell him i told him so he trudged along dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk atticus said stop ringing that bell dill grabbed the clapper in the silence that followed i wished he d start ringing it again atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hand on his hip jem he said what were you doing nothin sir i don t want any of that tell me i wa we were just tryin to give somethin to mr radley what were you trying to give him just a letter let me see it jem held out a filthy piece of paper atticus took it and tried to read it why do you want mr radley to come out dill said we thought he might enjoy u and dried up when atticus looked at him son he said to jem i m going to tell you something and tell you one time stop tormenting that man that go for the other two of you what mr radley did wa his own business if he wanted to come out he would if he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attention of inquisitive child which wa a mild term for the like of u how would we like it if atticus barged in on u without knocking when we were in our room at night we were in effect doing the same thing to mr radley what mr radley did might seem peculiar to u but it did not seem peculiar to him furthermore had it never occurred to u that the civil way to communicate with another being wa by the front door instead of a side window lastly we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there we were not to play an asinine game he had seen u playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town we weren t makin fun of him we weren t laughin at him said jem we were just so that wa what you were doing wasn t it makin fun of him no said atticus putting his life s history on display for the edification of the neighborhood jem seemed to swell a little i didn t say we were doin that i didn t say it atticus grinned dryly you just told me he said you stop this nonsense right now every one of you jem gaped at him you want to be a lawyer don t you our father s mouth wa suspiciously firm a if he were trying to hold it in line jem decided there wa no point in quibbling and wa silent when atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyer s trick on record he waited a respectful distance from the front step watched atticus leave the house and walk toward town when atticus wa out of earshot jem yelled after him i thought i wanted to be a lawyer but i ain t so sure now content prev next chapter yes said our father when jem asked him if we could go over and sit by miss rachel s fishpool with dill a this wa his last night in maycomb tell him so long for me and we ll see him next summer we leaped over the low wall that separated miss rachel s yard from our driveway jem whistled bob white and dill answered in the darkness not a breath blowing said jem looka yonder he pointed to the east a gigantic moon wa rising behind miss maudie s pecan tree that make it seem hotter he said cross in it tonight asked dill not looking up he wa constructing a cigarette from newspaper and string no just the lady don t light that thing dill you ll stink up this whole end of town there wa a lady in the moon in maycomb she sat at a dresser combing her hair we re gon na miss you boy i said reckon we better watch for mr avery mr avery boarded across the street from mr henry lafayette dubose s house besides making change in the collection plate every sunday mr avery sat on the porch every night until nine o clock and sneezed one evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last for he never did it again so long a we watched jem and i were leaving miss rachel s front step one night when dill stopped u golly looka yonder he pointed across the street at first we saw nothing but a kudzu covered front porch but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaf and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light some ten foot from source to earth it seemed to u jem said mr avery misfigured dill said he must drink a gallon a day and the ensuing contest to determine relative distance and respective prowess only made me feel left out again a i wa untalented in this area dill stretched yawned and said altogether too casually i know what let s go for a walk he sounded fishy to me nobody in maycomb just went for a walk where to dill dill jerked his head in a southerly direction jem said okay when i protested he said sweetly you don t have to come along angel may you don t have to go remember jem wa not one to dwell on past defeat it seemed the only message he got from atticus wa insight into the art of cross examination scout we ain t gon na do anything we re just goin to the street light and back we strolled silently down the sidewalk listening to porch swing creaking with the weight of the neighborhood listening to the soft night murmur of the grown people on our street occasionally we heard miss stephanie crawford laugh well said dill okay said jem why don t you go on home scout what are you gon na do dill and jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at boo radley and if i didn t want to go with them i could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut that wa all but what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight because nobody could see them at night because atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldn t hear the kingdom coming because if boo radley killed them they d miss school instead of vacation and because it wa easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime did i understand jem please scout i m tellin you for the last time shut your trap or go home i declare to the lord you re gettin more like a girl every day with that i had no option but to join them we thought it wa better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the radley lot we stood less chance of being seen the fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse jem held up the bottom wire and motioned dill under it i followed and held up the wire for jem it wa a tight squeeze for him don t make a sound he whispered don t get in a row of collard whatever you do they ll wake the dead with this thought in mind i made perhaps one step per minute i moved faster when i saw jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight we came to the gate that divided the garden from the back yard jem touched it the gate squeaked spit on it whispered dill you ve got u in a box jem i muttered we can t get out of here so easy sh h spit on it scout we spat ourselves dry and jem opened the gate slowly lifting it aside and resting it on the fence we were in the back yard the back of the radley house wa less inviting than the front a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house there were two door and two dark window between the door instead of a column a rough two by four supported one end of the roof an old franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch above it a hat rack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily ar r said jem softly lifting his foot smatter chicken he breathed that we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all direction wa confirmed when dill ahead of u spelled g o d in a whisper we crept to the side of the house around to the window with the hanging shutter the sill wa several inch taller than jem give you a hand up he muttered to dill wait though jem grabbed his left wrist and my right wrist i grabbed my left wrist and jem s right wrist we crouched and dill sat on our saddle we raised him and he caught the window sill hurry jem whispered we can t last much longer dill punched my shoulder and we lowered him to the ground what d you see nothing curtain there s a little teeny light way off somewhere though let s get away from here breathed jem let s go round in back again sh h he warned me a i wa about to protest let s try the back window dill no i said dill stopped and let jem go ahead when jem put his foot on the bottom step the step squeaked he stood still then tried his weight by degree the step wa silent jem skipped two step put his foot on the porch heaved himself to it and teetered a long moment he regained his balance and dropped to his knee he crawled to the window raised his head and looked in then i saw the shadow it wa the shadow of a man with a hat on at first i thought it wa a tree but there wa no wind blowing and tree trunk never walked the back porch wa bathed in moonlight and the shadow crisp a toast moved across the porch toward jem dill saw it next he put his hand to his face when it crossed jem jem saw it he put his arm over his head and went rigid the shadow stopped about a foot beyond jem it arm came out from it side dropped and wa still then it turned and moved back across jem walked along the porch and off the side of the house returning a it had come jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward u he flung open the gate danced dill and me through and shooed u between two row of swishing collard halfway through the collard i tripped a i tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood dill and jem dived beside me jem s breath came in sob fence by the schoolyard hurry scout jem held the bottom wire dill and i rolled through and were halfway to the shelter of the schoolyard s solitary oak when we sensed that jem wa not with u we ran back and found him struggling in the fence kicking his pant off to get loose he ran to the oak tree in his short safely behind it we gave way to numbness but jem s mind wa racing we got ta get home they ll miss u we ran across the schoolyard crawled under the fence to deer s pasture behind our house climbed our back fence and were at the back step before jem would let u pause to rest respiration normal the three of u strolled a casually a we could to the front yard we looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbor at the radley front gate we better go down there said jem they ll think it s funny if we don t show up mr nathan radley wa standing inside his gate a shotgun broken across his arm atticus wa standing beside miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford miss rachel and mr avery were near by none of them saw u come up we eased in beside miss maudie who looked around where were you all didn t you hear the commotion what happened asked jem mr radley shot at a negro in his collard patch oh did he hit him no said miss stephanie shot in the air scared him pale though say if anybody see a white nigger around that s the one say he s got the other barrel waitin for the next sound he hears in that patch an next time he won t aim high be it dog nigger or jem finch ma am asked jem atticus spoke where re your pant son pant sir pant it wa no use in his short before god and everybody i sighed ah mr finch in the glare from the streetlight i could see dill hatching one his eye widened his fat cherub face grew rounder what is it dill asked atticus ah i won em from him he said vaguely won them how dill s hand sought the back of his head he brought it forward and across his forehead we were playin strip poker up yonder by the fishpool he said jem and i relaxed the neighbor seemed satisfied they all stiffened but what wa strip poker we had no chance to find out miss rachel went off like the town fire siren doo o jee sus dill harris gamblin by my fishpool i ll strip poker you sir atticus saved dill from immediate dismemberment just a minute miss rachel he said i ve never heard of em doing that before were you all playing card jem fielded dill s fly with his eye shut no sir just with match i admired my brother match were dangerous but card were fatal jem scout said atticus i don t want to hear of poker in any form again go by dill s and get your pant jem settle it yourselves don t worry dill said jem a we trotted up the sidewalk she ain t gon na get you he ll talk her out of it that wa fast thinkin son listen you hear we stopped and heard atticus s voice not serious they all go through it miss rachel dill wa comforted but jem and i weren t there wa the problem of jem showing up some pant in the morning d give you some of mine said dill a we came to miss rachel s step jem said he couldn t get in them but thanks anyway we said good bye and dill went inside the house he evidently remembered he wa engaged to me for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of jem yawl write hear he bawled after u had jem s pant been safely on him we would not have slept much anyway every night sound i heard from my cot on the back porch wa magnified threefold every scratch of foot on gravel wa boo radley seeking revenge every passing negro laughing in the night wa boo radley loose and after u insect splashing against the screen were boo radley s insane finger picking the wire to piece the chinaberry tree were malignant hovering alive i lingered between sleep and wakefulness until i heard jem murmur sleep little three eye are you crazy sh h atticus s light s out in the waning moonlight i saw jem swing his foot to the floor i m goin after em he said i sat upright you can t i won t let you he wa struggling into his shirt i ve got to you do an i ll wake up atticus you do and i ll kill you i pulled him down beside me on the cot i tried to reason with him mr nathan s gon na find em in the morning jem he know you lost em when he show em to atticus it ll be pretty bad that s all there is to it go n back to bed that s what i know said jem that s why i m goin after em i began to feel sick going back to that place by himself i remembered miss stephanie mr nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard be it nigger dog jem knew that better than i i wa desperate look it ain t worth it jem a lickin hurt but it doesn t last you ll get your head shot off jem please he blew out his breath patiently i it s like this scout he muttered atticus ain t ever whipped me since i can remember i wanta keep it that way this wa a thought it seemed that atticus threatened u every other day you mean he s never caught you at anything maybe so but i just wanta keep it that way scout we shouldn a done that tonight scout it wa then i suppose that jem and i first began to part company sometimes i did not understand him but my period of bewilderment were short lived this wa beyond me please i pleaded can tcha just think about it for a minute by yourself on that place shut up it s not like he d never speak to you again or somethin i m gon na wake him up jem i swear i am jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight then i m goin with you i choked no you ain t you ll just make noise it wa no use i unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the step it must have been two o clock the moon wa setting and the lattice work shadow were fading into fuzzy nothingness jem s white shirt tail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning a faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my side he went the back way through deer s pasture across the schoolyard and around to the fence i thought at least that wa the way he wa headed it would take longer so it wa not time to worry yet i waited until it wa time to worry and listened for mr radley s shotgun then i thought i heard the back fence squeak it wa wishful thinking then i heard atticus cough i held my breath sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading he said he often woke up during the night checked on u and read himself back to sleep i waited for his light to go on straining my eye to see it flood the hall it stayed off and i breathed again the night crawler had retired but ripe chinaberry drummed on the roof when the wind stirred and the darkness wa desolate with the barking of distant dog there he wa returning to me his white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger he came up the back step latched the door behind him and sat on his cot wordlessly he held up his pant he lay down and for a while i heard his cot trembling soon he wa still i did not hear him stir again content prev next chapter jem stayed moody and silent for a week a atticus had once advised me to do i tried to climb into jem s skin and walk around in it if i had gone alone to the radley place at two in the morning my funeral would have been held the next afternoon so i left jem alone and tried not to bother him school started the second grade wa a bad a the first only worse they still flashed card at you and wouldn t let you read or write miss caroline s progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter however the usual crew had flunked the first grade again and were helpful in keeping order the only thing good about the second grade wa that this year i had to stay a late a jem and we usually walked home together at three o clock one afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home jem suddenly said there s something i didn t tell you a this wa his first complete sentence in several day i encouraged him about what about that night you ve never told me anything about that night i said jem waved my word away a if fanning gnat he wa silent for a while then he said when i went back for my breech they were all in a tangle when i wa gettin out of em i couldn t get em loose when i went back jem took a deep breath when i went back they were folded across the fence like they were expectin me across and something else jem s voice wa flat show you when we get home they d been sewed up not like a lady sewed em like somethin i d try to do all crooked it s almost like somebody knew you were comin back for em jem shuddered like somebody wa readin my mind like somebody could tell what i wa gon na do can t anybody tell what i m gon na do lest they know me can they scout jem s question wa an appeal i reassured him can t anybody tell what you re gon na do lest they live in the house with you and even i can t tell sometimes we were walking past our tree in it knot hole rested a ball of gray twine don t take it jem i said this is somebody s hidin place i don t think so scout yes it is somebody like walter cunningham come down here every recess and hide his thing and we come along and take em away from him listen let s leave it and wait a couple of day if it ain t gone then we ll take it okay okay you might be right said jem it must be some little kid s place hide his thing from the bigger folk you know it s only when school s in that we ve found thing yeah i said but we never go by here in the summertime we went home next morning the twine wa where we had left it when it wa still there on the third day jem pocketed it from then on we considered everything we found in the knot hole our property the second grade wa grim but jem assured me that the older i got the better school would be that he started off the same way and it wa not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value the sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning he went through a brief egyptian period that baffled me he tried to walk flat a great deal sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him putting one foot behind the other he declared egyptian walked that way i said if they did i didn t see how they got anything done but jem said they accomplished more than the american ever did they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming and asked where would we be today if they hadn t atticus told me to delete the adjective and i d have the fact there are no clearly defined season in south alabama summer drift into autumn and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter but turn to a daysold spring that melt into summer again that fall wa a long one hardly cool enough for a light jacket jem and i were trotting in our orbit one mild october afternoon when our knot hole stopped u again something white wa inside this time jem let me do the honor i pulled out two small image carved in soap one wa the figure of a boy the other wore a crude dress before i remembered that there wa no such thing a hoo dooing i shrieked and threw them down jem snatched them up what s the matter with you he yelled he rubbed the figure free of red dust these are good he said i ve never seen any these good he held them down to me they were almost perfect miniature of two child the boy had on short and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrow i looked up at jem a point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part i had never noticed it before jem looked from the girl doll to me the girl doll wore bang so did i these are u he said who did em you reckon who do we know around here who whittle he asked mr avery mr avery just doe like this i mean carves mr avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week he honed it down to a toothpick and chewed it there s old miss stephanie crawford s sweetheart i said he carves all right but he life down the country when would he ever pay any attention to u maybe he sits on the porch and look at u instead of miss stephanie if i wa him i would jem stared at me so long i asked what wa the matter but got nothing scout for an answer when we went home jem put the doll in his trunk less than two week later we found a whole package of chewing gum which we enjoyed the fact that everything on the radley place wa poison having slipped jem s memory the following week the knot hole yielded a tarnished medal jem showed it to atticus who said it wa a spelling medal that before we were born the maycomb county school had spelling contest and awarded medal to the winner atticus said someone must have lost it and had we asked around jem camel kicked me when i tried to say where we had found it jem asked atticus if he remembered anybody who ever won one and atticus said no our biggest prize appeared four day later it wa a pocket watch that wouldn t run on a chain with an aluminum knife you reckon it s white gold jem don t know i ll show it to atticus atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollar knife chain and all if it were new did you swap with somebody at school he asked oh no sir jem pulled out his grandfather s watch that atticus let him carry once a week if jem were careful with it on the day he carried the watch jem walked on egg atticus if it s all right with you i d rather have this one instead maybe i can fix it when the new wore off his grandfather s watch and carrying it became a day s burdensome task jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minute he did a fair job only one spring and two tiny piece left over but the watch would not run oh h he sighed it ll never go scout huh you reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever s leaving u these thing that d be right nice jem we can thank em what s wrong jem wa holding his ear shaking his head from side to side i don t get it i just don t get it i don t know why scout he looked toward the livingroom i ve got ta good mind to tell atticus no i reckon not i ll tell him for you no don t do that scout scout wha t he had been on the verge of telling me something all evening his face would brighten and he would lean toward me then he would change his mind he changed it again oh nothin here let s write a letter i pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose okay dear mister how do you know it s a man i bet it s miss maudie been bettin that for a long time ar r miss maudie can t chew gum jem broke into a grin you know she can talk real pretty sometimes one time i asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks that chewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless said jem carefully doesn t that sound nice yeah she can say nice thing sometimes she wouldn t have a watch and chain anyway dear sir said jem we appreciate the no we appreciate everything which you have put into the tree for u yours very truly jeremy atticus finch he won t know who you are if you sign it like that jem jem erased his name and wrote jem finch i signed jean louise finch scout beneath it jem put the note in an envelope next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree jem wa facing me when he looked up and i saw him go stark white scout i ran to him someone had filled our knot hole with cement don t you cry now scout don t cry now don t you worry he muttered at me all the way to school when we went home for dinner jem bolted his food ran to the porch and stood on the step i followed him hasn t passed by yet he said next day jem repeated his vigil and wa rewarded hidy do mr nathan he said morning jem scout said mr radley a he went by mr radley said jem mr radley turned around mr radley ah did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder yes he said i filled it up why d you do it sir tree s dying you plug em with cement when they re sick you ought to know that jem jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon when we passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on it cement and remained deep in thought he seemed to be working himself into a bad humor so i kept my distance a usual we met atticus coming home from work that evening when we were at our step jem said atticus look down yonder at that tree please sir what tree son the one on the corner of the radley lot comin from school yes is that tree dyin why no son i don t think so look at the leaf they re all green and full no brown patch anywhere it ain t even sick that tree s a healthy a you are jem why mr nathan radley said it wa dyin well maybe it is i m sure mr radley know more about his tree than we do atticus left u on the porch jem leaned on a pillar rubbing his shoulder against it do you itch jem i asked a politely a i could he did not answer come on in jem i said after while he stood there until nightfall and i waited for him when we went in the house i saw he had been cry his face wa dirty in the right place but i thought it odd that i had not heard him content prev next chapter for reason unfathomable to the most experienced prophet in maycomb county autumn turned to winter that year we had two week of the coldest weather since atticus said mr avery said it wa written on the rosetta stone that when child disobeyed their parent smoked cigarette and made war on each other the season would change jem and i were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberration of nature thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbor and discomfort to ourselves old mr radley died that winter but her death caused hardly a ripple the neighborhood seldom saw her except when she watered her canna jem and i decided that boo had got her at last but when atticus returned from the radley house he said she died of natural cause to our disappointment ask him jem whispered you ask him you re the oldest that s why you oughta ask him atticus i said did you see mr arthur atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me i did not jem restrained me from further question he said atticus wa still touchous about u and the radleys and it wouldn t do to push him any jem had a notion that atticus thought our activity that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker jem had no firm basis for his idea he said it wa merely a twitch next morning i awoke looked out the window and nearly died of fright my scream brought atticus from his bathroom half shaven the world s endin atticus please do something i dragged him to the window and pointed no it s not he said it s snowing jem asked atticus would it keep up jem had never seen snow either but he knew what it wa atticus said he didn t know any more about snow than jem did i think though if it s watery like that it ll turn to rain the telephone rang and atticus left the breakfast table to answer it that wa eula may he said when he returned i quote a it ha not snowed in maycomb county since there will be no school today eula may wa maycomb s leading telephone operator she wa entrusted with issuing public announcement wedding invitation setting off the fire siren and giving first aid instruction when dr reynolds wa away when atticus finally called u to order and bade u look at our plate instead of out the window jem asked how do you make a snowman i haven t the slightest idea said atticus i don t want you all to be disappointed but i doubt if there ll be enough snow for a snowball even calpurnia came in and said she thought it wa sticking when we ran to the back yard it wa covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow we shouldn t walk about in it said jem look every step you take s wasting it i looked back at my mushy footprint jem said if we waited until it snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman i stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake it burned jem it s hot no it ain t it s so cold it burn now don t eat it scout you re wasting it let it come down but i want to walk in it i know what we can go walk over at miss maudie s jem hopped across the front yard i followed in his track when we were on the sidewalk in front of miss maudie s mr avery accosted u he had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt see what you ve done he said hasn t snowed in maycomb since appomattox it s bad child like you make the season change i wondered if mr avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him to repeat his performance and reflected that if this wa our reward there wa something to say for sin i did not wonder where mr avery gathered his meteorological statistic they came straight from the rosetta stone jem finch you jem finch miss maudie s callin you jem you all stay in the middle of the yard there s some thrift buried under the snow near the porch don t step on it yessum called jem it s beautiful ain t it miss maudie beautiful my hind foot if it freeze tonight it ll carry off all my azalea miss maudie s old sunhat glistened with snow crystal she wa bending over some small bush wrapping them in burlap bag jem asked her what she wa doing that for keep em warm she said how can flower keep warm they don t circulate i can not answer that question jem finch all i know is if it freeze tonight these plant ll freeze so you cover em up is that clear yessum miss maudie what sir could scout and me borrow some of your snow heaven alive take it all there s an old peach basket under the house haul it off in that miss maudie s eye narrowed jem finch what are you going to do with my snow you ll see said jem and we transferred a much snow a we could from miss maudie s yard to ours a slushy operation what are we gon na do jem i asked you ll see he said now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up from the back yard to the front walk back in your track though he cautioned are we gon na have a snow baby jem no a real snowman got ta work hard now jem ran to the back yard produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behind the woodpile placing any worm he found to one side he went in the house returned with the laundry hamper filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard when we had five basket of earth and two basket of snow jem said we were ready to begin don t you think this is kind of a mess i asked look messy now but it won t later he said jem scooped up an armful of dirt patted it into a mound on which he added another load and another until he had constructed a torso jem i ain t ever heard of a nigger snowman i said he won t be black long he grunted jem procured some peachtree switch from the back yard plaited them and bent them into bone to be covered with dirt he look like stephanie crawford with her hand on her hip i said fat in the middle and little bitty arm i ll make em bigger jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt he looked thoughtfully at it for a moment then he molded a big stomach below the figure s waistline jem glanced at me his eye twinkling mr avery s sort of shaped like a snowman ain t he jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on he permitted me to cover only the back saving the public part for himself gradually mr avery turned white using bit of wood for eye nose mouth and button jem succeeded in making mr avery look cross a stick of stovewood completed the picture jem stepped back and viewed his creation it s lovely jem i said look almost like he d talk to you it is ain t it he said shyly we could not wait for atticus to come home for dinner but called and said we had a big surprise for him he seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in the front yard but he said we had done a jim dandy job i didn t know how you were going to do it he said to jem but from now on i ll never worry about what ll become of you son you ll always have an idea jem s ear reddened from atticus s compliment but he looked up sharply when he saw atticus stepping back atticus squinted at the snowman a while he grinned then laughed son i can t tell what you re going to be an engineer a lawyer or a portrait painter you ve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard we ve got to disguise this fellow atticus suggested that jem hone down his creation s front a little swap a broom for the stovewood and put an apron on him jem explained that if he did the snowman would become muddy and cease to be a snowman i don t care what you do so long a you do something said atticus you can t go around making caricature of the neighbor ain t a characterture said jem it look just like him mr avery might not think so i know what said jem he raced across the street disappeared into miss maudie s back yard and returned triumphant he stuck her sunhat on the snowman s head and jammed her hedge clipper into the crook of his arm atticus said that would be fine miss maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch she looked across the street at u suddenly she grinned jem finch she called you devil bring me back my hat sir jem looked up at atticus who shook his head she s just fussing he said she s really impressed with your accomplishment atticus strolled over to miss maudie s sidewalk where they engaged in an armwaving conversation the only phrase of which i caught wa erected an absolute morphodite in that yard atticus you ll never raise em the snow stopped in the afternoon the temperature dropped and by nightfall mr avery s direst prediction came true calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing but we were cold when atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it and asked calpurnia if she wanted to stay with u for the night calpurnia glanced up at the high ceiling and long window and said she thought she d be warmer at her house atticus drove her home in the car before i went to sleep atticus put more coal on the fire in my room he said the thermometer registered sixteen that it wa the coldest night in his memory and that our snowman outside wa frozen solid minute later it seemed i wa awakened by someone shaking me atticus s overcoat wa spread across me is it morning already baby get up atticus wa holding out my bathrobe and coat put your robe on first he said jem wa standing beside atticus groggy and tousled he wa holding his overcoat closed at the neck his other hand wa jammed into his pocket he looked strangely overweight hurry hon said atticus here re your shoe and sock stupidly i put them on is it morning no it s a little after one hurry now that something wa wrong finally got through to me what s the matter by then he did not have to tell me just a the bird know where to go when it rain i knew when there wa trouble in our street soft taffeta like sound and muffled scurrying sound filled me with helpless dread whose is it miss maudie s hon said atticus gently at the front door we saw fire spewing from miss maudie s diningroom window a if to confirm what we saw the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch and remained there screaming it s gone ain t it moaned jem i expect so said atticus now listen both of you go down and stand in front of the radley place keep out of the way do you hear see which way the wind s blowing oh said jem atticus reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out not yet son do a i tell you run now take care of scout you hear don t let her out of your sight with a push atticus started u toward the radley front gate we stood watching the street fill with men and car while fire silently devoured miss maudie s house why don t they hurry why don t they hurry muttered jem we saw why the old fire truck killed by the cold wa being pushed from town by a crowd of men when the men attached it hose to a hydrant the hose burst and water shot up tinkling down on the pavement oh h lord jem jem put his arm around me hush scout he said it ain t time to worry yet i ll let you know when the men of maycomb in all degree of dress and undress took furniture from miss maudie s house to a yard across the street i saw atticus carrying miss maudie s heavy oak rocking chair and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most sometimes we heard shout then mr avery s face appeared in an upstairs window he pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until men shouted come down from there dick the stair are going get outta there mr avery mr avery began climbing through the window scout he s stuck breathed jem oh god mr avery wa wedged tightly i buried my head under jem s arm and didn t look again until jem cried he s got loose scout he s all right i looked up to see mr avery cross the upstairs porch he swung his leg over the railing and wa sliding down a pillar when he slipped he fell yelled and hit miss maudie s shrubbery suddenly i noticed that the men were backing away from miss maudie s house moving down the street toward u they were no longer carrying furniture the fire wa well into the second floor and had eaten it way to the roof window frame were black against a vivid orange center jem it look like a pumpkin scout look smoke wa rolling off our house and miss rachel s house like fog off a riverbank and men were pulling hose toward them behind u the fire truck from abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house that book i said what said jem that tom swift book it ain t mine it s dill s don t worry scout it ain t time to worry yet said jem he pointed looka yonder in a group of neighbor atticus wa standing with his hand in his overcoat pocket he might have been watching a football game miss maudie wa beside him see there he s not worried yet said jem why ain t he on top of one of the house he s too old he d break his neck you think we oughta make him get our stuff out let s don t pester him he ll know when it s time said jem the abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house a man on the roof pointed to place that needed it most i watched our absolute morphodite go black and crumble miss maudie s sunhat settled on top of the heap i could not see her hedge clipper in the heat between our house miss rachel s and miss maudie s the men had long ago shed coat and bathrobe they worked in pajama top and nightshirt stuffed into their pant but i became aware that i wa slowly freezing where i stood jem tried to keep me warm but his arm wa not enough i pulled free of it and clutched my shoulder by dancing a little i could feel my foot another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of miss stephanie crawford s there wa no hydrant for another hose and the men tried to soak her house with hand extinguisher miss maudie s tin roof quelled the flame roaring the house collapsed fire gushed everywhere followed by a flurry of blanket from men on top of the adjacent house beating out spark and burning chunk of wood it wa dawn before the men began to leave first one by one then in group they pushed the maycomb fire truck back to town the abbottsville truck departed the third one remained we found out next day it had come from clark s ferry sixty mile away jem and i slid across the street miss maudie wa staring at the smoking black hole in her yard and atticus shook his head to tell u she did not want to talk he led u home holding onto our shoulder to cross the icy street he said miss maudie would stay with miss stephanie for the time being anybody want some hot chocolate he asked i shuddered when atticus started a fire in the kitchen stove a we drank our cocoa i noticed atticus looking at me first with curiosity then with sternness i thought i told you and jem to stay put he said why we did we stayed then whose blanket is that blanket yes ma am blanket it isn t ours i looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket i wa wearing around my shoulder squaw fashion atticus i don t know sir i i turned to jem for an answer but jem wa even more bewildered than i he said he didn t know how it got there we did exactly a atticus had told u we stood down by the radley gate away from everybody we didn t move an inch jem stopped mr nathan wa at the fire he babbled i saw him i saw him he wa tuggin that mattress atticus i swear that s all right son atticus grinned slowly look like all of maycomb wa out tonight in one way or another jem there s some wrapping paper in the pantry i think go get it and we ll atticus no sir jem seemed to have lost his mind he began pouring out our secret right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own omitting nothing knot hole pant and all mr nathan put cement in that tree atticus an he did it to stop u findin thing he s crazy i reckon like they say but atticus i swear to god he ain t ever harmed u he ain t ever hurt u he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pant instead he ain t ever hurt u atticus atticus said whoa son so gently that i wa greatly heartened it wa obvious that he had not followed a word jem said for all atticus said wa you re right we d better keep this and the blanket to ourselves someday maybe scout can thank him for covering her up thank who i asked boo radley you were so busy looking at the fire you didn t know it when he put the blanket around you my stomach turned to water and i nearly threw up when jem held out the blanket and crept toward me he sneaked out of the house turn round sneaked up an went like this atticus said dryly do not let this inspire you to further glory jeremy jem scowled i ain t gon na do anything to him but i watched the spark of fresh adventure leave his eye just think scout he said if you d just turned around you da seen him calpurnia woke u at noon atticus had said we need not go to school that day we d learn nothing after no sleep calpurnia said for u to try and clean up the front yard miss maudie s sunhat wa suspended in a thin layer of ice like a fly in amber and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedge clipper we found her in her back yard gazing at her frozen charred azalea we re bringing back your thing miss maudie said jem we re awful sorry miss maudie looked around and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face always wanted a smaller house jem finch give me more yard just think i ll have more room for my azalea now you ain t grievin miss maudie i asked surprised atticus said her house wa nearly all she had grieving child why i hated that old cow barn thought of settin fire to it a hundred time myself except they d lock me up but don t you worry about me jean louise finch there are way of doing thing you don t know about why i ll build me a little house and take me a couple of roomer and gracious i ll have the finest yard in alabama those bellingraths ll look plain puny when i get started jem and i looked at each other how d it catch miss maudie he asked i don t know jem probably the flue in the kitchen i kept a fire in there last night for my potted plant hear you had some unexpected company last night miss jean louise how d you know atticus told me on his way to town this morning tell you the truth i d like to ve been with you and i d ve had sense enough to turn around too miss maudie puzzled me with most of her possession gone and her beloved yard a shamble she still took a lively and cordial interest in jem s and my affair she must have seen my perplexity she said only thing i worried about last night wa all the danger and commotion it caused this whole neighborhood could have gone up mr avery ll be in bed for a week he s right stove up he s too old to do thing like that and i told him so soon a i can get my hand clean and when stephanie crawford s not looking i ll make him a lane cake that stephanie s been after my recipe for thirty year and if she think i ll give it to her just because i m staying with her she s got another think coming i reflected that if miss maudie broke down and gave it to her miss stephanie couldn t follow it anyway miss maudie had once let me see it among other thing the recipe called for one large cup of sugar it wa a still day the air wa so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank rattle and strain before it struck the hour miss maudie s nose wa a color i had never seen before and i inquired about it i ve been out here since six o clock she said should be frozen by now she held up her hand a network of tiny line crisscrossed her palm brown with dirt and dried blood you ve ruined em said jem why don t you get a colored man there wa no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added or scout n me we can help you miss maudie said thank you sir but you ve got a job of your own over there she pointed to our yard you mean the morphodite i asked shoot we can rake him up in a jiffy miss maudie stared down at me her lip moving silently suddenly she put her hand to her head and whooped when we left her she wa still chuckling jem said he didn t know what wa the matter with her that wa just miss maudie content prev next chapter you can just take that back boy this order given by me to cecil jacob wa the beginning of a rather thin time for jem and me my fist were clenched and i wa ready to let fly atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more i wa far too old and too big for such childish thing and the sooner i learned to hold in the better off everybody would be i soon forgot cecil jacob made me forget he had announced in the schoolyard the day before that scout finch s daddy defended nigger i denied it but told jem what d he mean sayin that i asked nothing jem said ask atticus he ll tell you do you defend nigger atticus i asked him that evening of course i do don t say nigger scout that s common s what everybody at school say from now on it ll be everybody less one well if you don t want me to grow up talkin that way why do you send me to school my father looked at me mildly amusement in his eye despite our compromise my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first day s dose of it the beginning of last september had brought on sinking spell dizziness and mild gastric complaint i went so far a to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of miss rachel s cook s son who wa afflicted with a tremendous ringworm it didn t take but i wa worrying another bone do all lawyer defend n negro atticus of course they do scout then why did cecil say you defended nigger he made it sound like you were runnin a still atticus sighed i m simply defending a negro his name s tom robinson he life in that little settlement beyond the town dump he s a member of calpurnia s church and cal know his family well she say they re clean living folk scout you aren t old enough to understand some thing yet but there s been some high talk around town to the effect that i shouldn t do much about defending this man it s a peculiar case it won t come to trial until summer session john taylor wa kind enough to give u a postponement if you shouldn t be defendin him then why are you doin it for a number of reason said atticus the main one is if i didn t i couldn t hold up my head in town i couldn t represent this county in the legislature i couldn t even tell you or jem not to do something again you mean if you didn t defend that man jem and me wouldn t have to mind you any more that s about right why because i could never ask you to mind me again scout simply by the nature of the work every lawyer get at least one case in his lifetime that affect him personally this one s mine i guess you might hear some ugly talk about it at school but do one thing for me if you will you just hold your head high and keep those fist down no matter what anybody say to you don t you let em get your goat try fighting with your head for a change it s a good one even if it doe resist learning atticus are we going to win it no honey then why simply because we were licked a hundred year before we started is no reason for u not to try to win atticus said you sound like cousin ike finch i said cousin ike finch wa maycomb county s sole surviving confederate veteran he wore a general hood type beard of which he wa inordinately vain at least once a year atticus jem and i called on him and i would have to kiss him it wa horrible jem and i would listen respectfully to atticus and cousin ike rehash the war tell you atticus cousin ike would say the missouri compromise wa what licked u but if i had to go through it agin i d walk every step of the way there an every step back jist like i did before an furthermore we d whip em this time now in when stonewall jackson came around by i beg your pardon young folk ol blue light wa in heaven then god rest his saintly brow come here scout said atticus i crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin he put his arm around me and rocked me gently it s different this time he said this time we aren t fighting the yankee we re fighting our friend but remember this no matter how bitter thing get they re still our friend and this is still our home with this in mind i faced cecil jacob in the schoolyard next day you gon na take that back boy you got ta make me first he yelled my folk said your daddy wa a disgrace an that nigger oughta hang from the water tank i drew a bead on him remembered what atticus had said then dropped my fist and walked away scout s a cow ward ringing in my ear it wa the first time i ever walked away from a fight somehow if i fought cecil i would let atticus down atticus so rarely asked jem and me to do something for him i could take being called a coward for him i felt extremely noble for having remembered and remained noble for three week then christmas came and disaster struck jem and i viewed christmas with mixed feeling the good side wa the tree and uncle jack finch every christmas eve day we met uncle jack at maycomb junction and he would spend a week with u a flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineament of aunt alexandra and francis i suppose i should include uncle jimmy aunt alexandra s husband but a he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say get off the fence once i never saw any reason to take notice of him neither did aunt alexandra long ago in a burst of friendliness aunty and uncle jimmy produced a son named henry who left home a soon a wa humanly possible married and produced francis henry and his wife deposited francis at his grandparent every christmas then pursued their own pleasure no amount of sighing could induce atticus to let u spend christmas day at home we went to finch s landing every christmas in my memory the fact that aunty wa a good cook wa some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with francis hancock he wa a year older than i and i avoided him on principle he enjoyed everything i disapproved of and disliked my ingenuous diversion aunt alexandra wa atticus s sister but when jem told me about changeling and sibling i decided that she had been swapped at birth that my grandparent had perhaps received a crawford instead of a finch had i ever harbored the mystical notion about mountain that seem to obsess lawyer and judge aunt alexandra would have been analogous to mount everest throughout my early life she wa cold and there when uncle jack jumped down from the train christmas eve day we had to wait for the porter to hand him two long package jem and i always thought it funny when uncle jack pecked atticus on the cheek they were the only two men we ever saw kiss each other uncle jack shook hand with jem and swung me high but not high enough uncle jack wa a head shorter than atticus the baby of the family he wa younger than aunt alexandra he and aunty looked alike but uncle jack made better use of his face we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin he wa one of the few men of science who never terrified me probably because he never behaved like a doctor whenever he performed a minor service for jem and me a removing a splinter from a foot he would tell u exactly what he wa going to do give u an estimation of how much it would hurt and explain the use of any tongs he employed one christmas i lurked in corner nursing a twisted splinter in my foot permitting no one to come near me when uncle jack caught me he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his dressing gown smoking a hookah and delivering five minute sermon to any passer by who desired spiritual comfort i interrupted to make uncle jack let me know when he would pull it out but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezer and said he yanked it while i wa laughing that wa what wa known a relativity what s in those package i asked him pointing to the long thin parcel the porter had given him none of your business he said jem said how s rose aylmer rose aylmer wa uncle jack s cat she wa a beautiful yellow female uncle jack said wa one of the few woman he could stand permanently he reached into his coat pocket and brought out some snapshot we admired them she s gettin fat i said i should think so she eats all the leftover finger and ear from the hospital aw that s a damn story i said i beg your pardon atticus said don t pay any attention to her jack she s trying you out cal say she s been cussing fluently for a week now uncle jack raised his eyebrow and said nothing i wa proceeding on the dim theory aside from the innate attractiveness of such word that if atticus discovered i had picked them up at school he wouldn t make me go but at supper that evening when i asked him to pas the damn ham please uncle jack pointed at me see me afterwards young lady he said when supper wa over uncle jack went to the livingroom and sat down he slapped his thigh for me to come sit on his lap i liked to smell him he wa like a bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet he pushed back my bang and looked at me you re more like atticus than your mother he said you re also growing out of your pant a little i reckon they fit all right you like word like damn and hell now don t you i said i reckoned so well i don t said uncle jack not unless there s extreme provocation connected with em i ll be here a week and i don t want to hear any word like that while i m here scout you ll get in trouble if you go around saying thing like that you want to grow up to be a lady don t you i said not particularly of course you do now let s get to the tree we decorated the tree until bedtime and that night i dreamed of the two long package for jem and me next morning jem and i dived for them they were from atticus who had written uncle jack to get them for u and they were what we had asked for don t point them in the house said atticus when jem aimed at a picture on the wall you ll have to teach em to shoot said uncle jack that s your job said atticus i merely bowed to the inevitable it took atticus s courtroom voice to drag u away from the tree he declined to let u take our air rifle to the landing i had already begun to think of shooting francis and said if we made one false move he d take them away from u for good finch s landing consisted of three hundred and sixty six step down a high bluff and ending in a jetty farther down stream beyond the bluff were trace of an old cotton landing where finch negro had loaded bale and produce unloaded block of ice flour and sugar farm equipment and feminine apparel a two rut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark tree at the end of the road wa a two storied white house with porch circling it upstairs and downstairs in his old age our ancestor simon finch had built it to please his nagging wife but with the porch all resemblance to ordinary house of it era ended the internal arrangement of the finch house were indicative of simon s guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring there were six bedroom upstairs four for the eight female child one for welcome finch the sole son and one for visiting relative simple enough but the daughter room could be reached only by one staircase welcome s room and the guestroom only by another the daughter staircase wa in the groundfloor bedroom of their parent so simon always knew the hour of his daughter nocturnal coming and going there wa a kitchen separate from the rest of the house tacked onto it by a wooden catwalk in the back yard wa a rusty bell on a pole used to summon field hand or a a distress signal a widow s walk wa on the roof but no widow walked there from it simon oversaw his overseer watched the river boat and gazed into the life of surrounding landholder there went with the house the usual legend about the yankee one finch female recently engaged donned her complete trousseau to save it from raider in the neighborhood she became stuck in the door to the daughter staircase but wa doused with water and finally pushed through when we arrived at the landing aunt alexandra kissed uncle jack francis kissed uncle jack uncle jimmy shook hand silently with uncle jack jem and i gave our present to francis who gave u a present jem felt his age and gravitated to the adult leaving me to entertain our cousin francis wa eight and slicked back his hair what d you get for christmas i asked politely just what i asked for he said francis had requested a pair of knee pant a red leather booksack five shirt and an untied bow tie that s nice i lied jem and me got air rifle and jem got a chemistry set a toy one i reckon no a real one he s gon na make me some invisible ink and i m gon na write to dill in it francis asked what wa the use of that well can t you just see his face when he get a letter from me with nothing in it it ll drive him nut talking to francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean he wa the most boring child i ever met a he lived in mobile he could not inform on me to school authority but he managed to tell everything he knew to aunt alexandra who in turn unburdened herself to atticus who either forgot it or gave me hell whichever struck his fancy but the only time i ever heard atticus speak sharply to anyone wa when i once heard him say sister i do the best i can with them it had something to do with my going around in overall aunt alexandra wa fanatical on the subject of my attire i could not possibly hope to be a lady if i wore breech when i said i could do nothing in a dress she said i wasn t supposed to be doing thing that required pant aunt alexandra s vision of my deportment involved playing with small stove tea set and wearing the add a pearl necklace she gave me when i wa born furthermore i should be a ray of sunshine in my father s lonely life i suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pant just a well but aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam that i wa born good but had grown progressively worse every year she hurt my feeling and set my teeth permanently on edge but when i asked atticus about it he said there were already enough sunbeam in the family and to go on about my business he didn t mind me much the way i wa at christmas dinner i sat at the little table in the diningroom jem and francis sat with the adult at the dining table aunty had continued to isolate me long after jem and francis graduated to the big table i often wondered what she thought i d do get up and throw something i sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once i would prove to her how civilized i could be after all i ate at home every day with no major mishap when i begged atticus to use his influence he said he had none we were guest and we sat where she told u to sit he also said aunt alexandra didn t understand girl much she d never had one but her cooking made up for everything three kind of meat summer vegetable from her pantry shelf peach pickle two kind of cake and ambrosia constituted a modest christmas dinner afterwards the adult made for the livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition jem lay on the floor and i went to the back yard put on your coat said atticus dreamily so i didn t hear him francis sat beside me on the back step that wa the best yet i said grandma s a wonderful cook said francis she s gon na teach me how boy don t cook i giggled at the thought of jem in an apron grandma say all men should learn to cook that men oughta be careful with their wife and wait on em when they don t feel good said my cousin i don t want dill waitin on me i said i d rather wait on him dill yeah don t say anything about it yet but we re gon na get married a soon a we re big enough he asked me last summer francis hooted what s the matter with him i asked ain t anything the matter with him you mean that little runt grandma say stay with miss rachel every summer that s exactly who i mean i know all about him said francis what about him grandma say he hasn t got a home ha too he life in meridian he just get passed around from relative to relative and miss rachel keep him every summer francis that s not so francis grinned at me you re mighty dumb sometimes jean louise guess you don t know any better though what do you mean if uncle atticus let you run around with stray dog that s his own business like grandma say so it ain t your fault i guess it ain t your fault if uncle atticus is a nigger lover besides but i m here to tell you it certainly doe mortify the rest of the family francis what the hell do you mean just what i said grandma say it s bad enough he let you all run wild but now he s turned out a nigger lover we ll never be able to walk the street of maycomb agin he s ruinin the family that s what he s doin francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen at a safe distance he called he s nothin but a nigger lover he is not i roared i don t know what you re talkin about but you better cut it out this red hot minute i leaped off the step and ran down the catwalk it wa easy to collar francis i said take it back quick francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen nigger lover he yelled when stalking one s prey it is best to take one s time say nothing and a sure a egg he will become curious and emerge francis appeared at the kitchen door you still mad jean louise he asked tentatively nothing to speak of i said francis came out on the catwalk you gon na take it back fra ancis but i wa too quick on the draw francis shot back into the kitchen so i retired to the step i could wait patiently i had sat there perhaps five minute when i heard aunt alexandra speak where s francis he s out yonder in the kitchen he know he s not supposed to play in there francis came to the door and yelled grandma she s got me in here and she won t let me out what is all this jean louise i looked up at aunt alexandra i haven t got

out of sight francis came out head up and grinning don t you fool with me he said he jumped into the yard and kept his distance kicking tuft of grass turning around occasionally to smile at me jem appeared on the porch looked at u and went away francis climbed the mimosa tree came down put his hand in his pocket and strolled around the yard hah he said i asked him who he thought he wa uncle jack francis said he reckoned i got told for me to just sit there and leave him alone i ain t botherin you i said francis looked at me carefully concluded that i had been sufficiently subdued and crooned softly nigger lover this time i split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth my left impaired i sailed in with my right but not for long uncle jack pinned my arm to my side and said stand still aunt alexandra ministered to francis wiping his tear away with her handkerchief rubbing his hair patting his cheek atticus jem and uncle jimmy had come to the back porch when francis started yelling who started this said uncle jack francis and i pointed at each other grandma he bawled she called me a whore lady and jumped on me is that true scout said uncle jack i reckon so when uncle jack looked down at me his feature were like aunt alexandra s you know i told you you d get in trouble if you used word like that i told you didn t i yes sir but well you re in trouble now stay there i wa debating whether to stand there or run and tarried in indecision a moment too long i turned to flee but uncle jack wa quicker i found myself suddenly looking at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass i ll never speak to you again a long a i live i hate you an despise you an hope you die tomorrow a statement that seemed to encourage uncle jack more than anything i ran to atticus for comfort but he said i had it coming and it wa high time we went home i climbed into the back seat of the car without saying good bye to anyone and at home i ran to my room and slammed the door jem tried to say something nice but i wouldn t let him when i surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red mark and i wa reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door i asked who it wa uncle jack answered go away uncle jack said if i talked like that he d lick me again so i wa quiet when he entered the room i retreated to a corner and turned my back on him scout he said do you still hate me go on please sir why i didn t think you d hold it against me he said i m disappointed in you you had that coming and you know it didn t either honey you can t go around calling people you ain t fair i said you ain t fair uncle jack s eyebrow went up not fair how not you re real nice uncle jack an i reckon i love you even after what you did but you don t understand child much uncle jack put his hand on his hip and looked down at me and why do i not understand child miss jean louise such conduct a yours required little understanding it wa obstreperous disorderly and abusive you gon na give me a chance to tell you i don t mean to sas you i m just tryin to tell you uncle jack sat down on the bed his eyebrow came together and he peered up at me from under them proceed he said i took a deep breath well in the first place you never stopped to gim me a chance to tell you my side of it you just lit right into me when jem an i fuss atticus doesn t ever just listen to jem s side of it he hears mine too an in the second place you told me never to use word like that except in ex extreme provocation and francis provocated me enough to knock his block off uncle jack scratched his head what wa your side of it scout francis called atticus somethin an i wasn t about to take it off him what did francis call him a nigger lover i ain t very sure what it mean but the way francis said it tell you one thing right now uncle jack i ll be i swear before god if i ll sit there and let him say somethin about atticus he called atticus that yes sir he did an a lot more said atticus d be the ruination of the family an he let jem an me run wild from the look on uncle jack s face i thought i wa in for it again when he said we ll see about this i knew francis wa in for it i ve a good mind to go out there tonight please sir just let it go please i ve no intention of letting it go he said alexandra should know about this the idea of wait ll i get my hand on that boy uncle jack please promise me somethin please sir promise you won t tell atticus about this he he asked me one time not to let anything i heard about him make me mad an i d ruther him think we were fightin about somethin else instead please promise but i don t like francis getting away with something like that he didn t you reckon you could tie up my hand it s still bleedin some of course i will baby i know of no hand i would be more delighted to tie up will you come this way uncle jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom while he cleaned and bandaged my knuckle he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old gentleman who had a cat named hodge and who counted all the crack in the sidewalk when he went to town there now he said you ll have a very unladylike scar on your wedding ring finger thank you sir uncle jack ma am what s a whore lady uncle jack plunged into another long tale about an old prime minister who sat in the house of common and blew feather in the air and tried to keep them there when all about him men were losing their head i guess he wa trying to answer my question but he made no sense whatsoever later when i wa supposed to be in bed i went down the hall for a drink of water and heard atticus and uncle jack in the livingroom i shall never marry atticus why i might have child atticus said you ve a lot to learn jack i know your daughter gave me my first lesson this afternoon she said i didn t understand child much and told me why she wa quite right atticus she told me how i should have treated her oh dear i m so sorry i romped on her atticus chuckled she earned it so don t feel too remorseful i waited on tenterhook for uncle jack to tell atticus my side of it but he didn t he simply murmured her use of bathroom invective leaf nothing to the imagination but she doesn t know the meaning of half she say she asked me what a whore lady wa did you tell her no i told her about lord melbourne jack when a child asks you something answer him for goodness sake but don t make a production of it child are child but they can spot an evasion quicker than adult and evasion simply muddle em no my father mused you had the right answer this afternoon but the wrong reason bad language is a stage all child go through and it dy with time when they learn they re not attracting attention with it hotheadedness isn t scout s got to learn to keep her head and learn soon with what s in store for her these next few month she s coming along though jem s getting older and she follows his example a good bit now all she need is assistance sometimes atticus you ve never laid a hand on her i admit that so far i ve been able to get by with threat jack she mind me a well a she can doesn t come up to scratch half the time but she try that s not the answer said uncle jack no the answer is she know i know she try that s what make the difference what bother me is that she and jem will have to absorb some ugly thing pretty soon i m not worried about jem keeping his head but scout d just a soon jump on someone a look at him if her pride s at stake i waited for uncle jack to break his promise he still didn t atticus how bad is this going to be you haven t had too much chance to discus it it couldn t be worse jack the only thing we ve got is a black man s word against the ewells the evidence boil down to you did i didn t the jury couldn t possibly be expected to take tom robinson s word against the ewells are you acquainted with the ewells uncle jack said yes he remembered them he described them to atticus but atticus said you re a generation off the present one are the same though what are you going to do then before i m through i intend to jar the jury a bit i think we ll have a reasonable chance on appeal though i really can t tell at this stage jack you know i d hoped to get through life without a case of this kind but john taylor pointed at me and said you re it let this cup pas from you eh right but do you think i could face my child otherwise you know what s going to happen a well a i do jack and i hope and pray i can get jem and scout through it without bitterness and most of all without catching maycomb s usual disease why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a negro come up is something i don t pretend to understand i just hope that jem and scout come to me for their answer instead of listening to the town i hope they trust me enough jean louise my scalp jumped i stuck my head around the corner sir go to bed i scurried to my room and went to bed uncle jack wa a prince of a fellow not to let me down but i never figured out how atticus knew i wa listening and it wa not until many year later that i realized he wanted me to hear every word he said content prev next chapter atticus wa feeble he wa nearly fifty when jem and i asked him why he wa so old he said he got started late which we felt reflected upon his ability and manliness he wa much older than the parent of our school contemporary and there wa nothing jem or i could say about him when our classmate said my father jem wa football crazy atticus wa never too tired to play keep away but when jem wanted to tackle him atticus would say i m too old for that son our father didn t do anything he worked in an office not in a drugstore atticus did not drive a dump truck for the county he wa not the sheriff he did not farm work in a garage or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone besides that he wore glass he wa nearly blind in his left eye and said left eye were the tribal curse of the finch whenever he wanted to see something well he turned his head and looked from his right eye he did not do the thing our schoolmate father did he never went hunting he did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke he sat in the livingroom and read with these attribute however he would not remain a inconspicuous a we wished him to that year the school buzzed with talk about him defending tom robinson none of which wa complimentary after my bout with cecil jacob when i committed myself to a policy of cowardice word got around that scout finch wouldn t fight any more her daddy wouldn t let her this wa not entirely correct i wouldn t fight publicly for atticus but the family wa private ground i would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail francis hancock for example knew that when he gave u our air rifle atticus wouldn t teach u to shoot uncle jack instructed u in the rudiment thereof he said atticus wasn t interested in gun atticus said to jem one day i d rather you shot at tin can in the back yard but i know you ll go after bird shoot all the bluejays you want if you can hit em but remember it s a sin to kill a mockingbird that wa the only time i ever heard atticus say it wa a sin to do something and i asked miss maudie about it your father s right she said mockingbird don t do one thing but make music for u to enjoy they don t eat up people s garden don t nest in corncrib they don t do one thing but sing their heart out for u that s why it s a sin to kill a mockingbird miss maudie this is an old neighborhood ain t it been here longer than the town nome i mean the folk on our street are all old jem and me s the only child around here mr dubose is close on to a hundred and miss rachel s old and so are you and atticus i don t call fifty very old said miss maudie tartly not being wheeled around yet am i neither s your father but i must say providence wa kind enough to burn down that old mausoleum of mine i m too old to keep it up maybe you re right jean louise this is a settled neighborhood you ve never been around young folk much have you yessum at school i mean young grown ups you re lucky you know you and jem have the benefit of your father s age if your father wa thirty you d find life quite different i sure would atticus can t do anything you d be surprised said miss maudie there s life in him yet what can he do well he can make somebody s will so airtight can t anybody meddle with it shoot well did you know he s the best checker player in this town why down at the landing when we were coming up atticus finch could beat everybody on both side of the river good lord miss maudie jem and me beat him all the time it s about time you found out it s because he let you did you know he can play a jew s harp this modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him well she said well what miss maudie well nothing nothing it seems with all that you d be proud of him can t everybody play a jew s harp now keep out of the way of the carpenter you d better go home i ll be in my azalea and can t watch you plank might hit you i went to the back yard and found jem plugging away at a tin can which seemed stupid with all the bluejays around i returned to the front yard and busied myself for two hour erecting a complicated breastwork at the side of the porch consisting of a tire an orange crate the laundry hamper the porch chair and a small u s flag jem gave me from a popcorn box when atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across the street what are you shooting at miss maudie s rear end atticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bush he pushed his hat to the back of his head and crossed the street maudie he called i thought i d better warn you you re in considerable peril miss maudie straightened up and looked toward me she said atticus you are a devil from hell when atticus returned he told me to break camp don t you ever let me catch you pointing that gun at anybody again he said i wished my father wa a devil from hell i sounded out calpurnia on the subject mr finch why he can do lot of thing like what i asked calpurnia scratched her head well i don t rightly know she said jem underlined it when he asked atticus if he wa going out for the methodist and atticus said he d break his neck if he did he wa just too old for that sort of thing the methodist were trying to pay off their church mortgage and had challenged the baptist to a game of touch football everybody in town s father wa playing it seemed except atticus jem said he didn t even want to go but he wa unable to resist football in any form and he stood gloomily on the sideline with atticus and me watching cecil jacob s father make touchdown for the baptist one saturday jem and i decided to go exploring with our air rifle to see if we could find a rabbit or a squirrel we had gone about five hundred yard beyond the radley place when i noticed jem squinting at something down the street he had turned his head to one side and wa looking out of the corner of his eye whatcha looking at that old dog down yonder he said that s old tim johnson ain t it yeah tim johnson wa the property of mr harry johnson who drove the mobile bus and lived on the southern edge of town tim wa a liver colored bird dog the pet of maycomb what s he doing i don t know scout we better go home aw jem it s february i don t care i m gon na tell cal we raced home and ran to the kitchen cal said jem can you come down the sidewalk a minute what for jem i can t come down the sidewalk every time you want me there s somethin wrong with an old dog down yonder calpurnia sighed i can t wrap up any dog s foot now there s some gauze in the bathroom go get it and do it yourself jem shook his head he s sick cal something s wrong with him what s he doin trying to catch his tail no he s doin like this jem gulped like a goldfish hunched his shoulder and twitched his torso he s goin like that only not like he mean to are you telling me a story jem finch calpurnia s voice hardened no cal i swear i m not wa he runnin no he s just moseyin along so slow you can t hardly tell it he s comin this way calpurnia rinsed her hand and followed jem into the yard i don t see any dog she said she followed u beyond the radley place and looked where jem pointed tim johnson wa not much more than a speck in the distance but he wa closer to u he walked erratically a if his right leg were shorter than his left leg he reminded me of a car stuck in a sandbed he s gone lopsided said jem calpurnia stared then grabbed u by the shoulder and ran u home she shut the wood door behind u went to the telephone and shouted gim me mr finch s office mr finch she shouted this is cal i swear to god there s a mad dog down the street a piece he s comin this way yes sir he s mr finch i declare he is old tim johnson yes sir yessir yes she hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what atticus had said she rattled the telephone hook and said miss eula may now ma am i m through talkin to mr finch please don t connect me no more listen miss eula may can you call miss rachel and miss stephanie crawford and whoever s got a phone on this street and tell em a mad dog s comin please ma am calpurnia listened i know it s february miss eula may but i know a mad dog when i see one please ma am hurry calpurnia asked jem radleys got a phone jem looked in the book and said no they won t come out anyway cal i don t care i m gon na tell em she ran to the front porch jem and i at her heel you stay in that house she yelled calpurnia s message had been received by the neighborhood every wood door within our range of vision wa closed tight we saw no trace of tim johnson we watched calpurnia running toward the radley place holding her skirt and apron above her knee she went up to the front step and banged on the door she got no answer and she shouted mr nathan mr arthur mad dog s comin mad dog s comin she s supposed to go around in back i said jem shook his head don t make any difference now he said calpurnia pounded on the door in vain no one acknowledged her warning no one seemed to have heard it a calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black ford swung into the driveway atticus and mr heck tate got out mr heck tate wa the sheriff of maycomb county he wa a tall a atticus but thinner he wa long nosed wore boot with shiny metal eye hole boot pant and a lumber jacket his belt had a row of bullet sticking in it he carried a heavy rifle when he and atticus reached the porch jem opened the door stay inside son said atticus where is he cal he oughta be here by now said calpurnia pointing down the street not runnin is he asked mr tate naw sir he s in the twitchin stage mr heck should we go after him heck asked atticus we better wait mr finch they usually go in a straight line but you never can tell he might follow the curve hope he doe or he ll go straight in the radley back yard let s wait a minute don t think he ll get in the radley yard said atticus fence ll stop him he ll probably follow the road i thought mad dog foamed at the mouth galloped leaped and lunged at throat and i thought they did it in august had tim johnson behaved thus i would have been less frightened nothing is more deadly than a deserted waiting street the tree were still the mockingbird were silent the carpenter at miss maudie s house had vanished i heard mr tate sniff then blow his nose i saw him shift his gun to the crook of his arm i saw miss stephanie crawford s face framed in the glass window of her front door miss maudie appeared and stood beside her atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair and rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh there he is he said softly tim johnson came into sight walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve parallel to the radley house look at him whispered jem mr heck said they walked in a straight line he can t even stay in the road he look more sick than anything i said let anything get in front of him and he ll come straight at it mr tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward he s got it all right mr finch tim johnson wa advancing at a snail s pace but he wa not playing or sniffing at foliage he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that wa inching him toward u we could see him shiver like a horse shedding fly his jaw opened and shut he wa alist but he wa being pulled gradually toward u he s lookin for a place to die said jem mr tate turned around he s far from dead jem he hasn t got started yet tim johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the radley place and what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road he would take he made a few hesitant step and stopped in front of the radley gate then he tried to turn around but wa having difficulty atticus said he s within range heck you better get him before he go down the side street lord know who s around the corner go inside cal calpurnia opened the screen door latched it behind her then unlatched it and held onto the hook she tried to block jem and me with her body but we looked out from beneath her arm take him mr finch mr tate handed the rifle to atticus jem and i nearly fainted don t waste time heck said atticus go on mr finch this is a one shot job atticus shook his head vehemently don t just stand there heck he won t wait all day for you for god s sake mr finch look where he is miss and you ll go straight into the radley house i can t shoot that well and you know it i haven t shot a gun in thirty year mr tate almost threw the rifle at atticus i d feel mighty comfortable if you did now he said in a fog jem and i watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle of the street he walked quickly but i thought he moved like an underwater swimmer time had slowed to a nauseating crawl when atticus raised his glass calpurnia murmured sweet jesus help him and put her hand to her cheek atticus pushed his glass to his forehead they slipped down and he dropped them in the street in the silence i heard them crack atticus rubbed his eye and chin we saw him blink hard in front of the radley gate tim johnson had made up what wa left of his mind he had finally turned himself around to pursue his original course up our street he made two step forward then stopped and raised his head we saw his body go rigid with movement so swift they seemed simultaneous atticus s hand yanked a balltipped lever a he brought the gun to his shoulder the rifle cracked tim johnson leaped flopped over and crumpled on the sidewalk in a brown and white heap he didn t know what hit him mr tate jumped off the porch and ran to the radley place he stopped in front of the dog squatted turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his left eye you were a little to the right mr finch he called always wa answered atticus if i had my druthers i d take a shotgun he stooped and picked up his glass ground the broken lens to powder under his heel and went to mr tate and stood looking down at tim johnson door opened one by one and the neighborhood slowly came alive miss maudie walked down the step with miss stephanie crawford jem wa paralyzed i pinched him to get him moving but when atticus saw u coming he called stay where you are when mr tate and atticus returned to the yard mr tate wa smiling i ll have zeebo collect him he said you haven t forgot much mr finch they say it never leaf you atticus wa silent atticus said jem yes nothin i saw that one shot finch atticus wheeled around and faced miss maudie they looked at one another without saying anything and atticus got into the sheriff s car come here he said to jem don t you go near that dog you understand don t go near him he s just a dangerous dead a alive yes sir said jem atticus what son nothing what s the matter with you boy can t you talk said mr tate grinning at jem didn t you know your daddy s hush heck said atticus let s go back to town when they drove away jem and i went to miss stephanie s front step we sat waiting for zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck jem sat in numb confusion and miss stephanie said uh uh uh who da thought of a mad dog in february maybe he wadn t mad maybe he wa just crazy i d hate to see harry johnson s face when he get in from the mobile run and find atticus finch s shot his dog bet he wa just full of flea from somewhere miss maudie said miss stephanie d be singing a different tune if tim johnson wa still coming up the street that they d find out soon enough they d send his head to montgomery jem became vaguely articulate d you see him scout d you see him just standin there n all of a sudden he just relaxed all over an it looked like that gun wa a part of him an he did it so quick like i hafta aim for ten minute fore i can hit somethin miss maudie grinned wickedly well now miss jean louise she said still think your father can t do anything still ashamed of him nome i said meekly forgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the jew s harp atticus finch wa the deadest shot in maycomb county in his time dead shot echoed jem that s what i said jem finch guess you ll change your tune now the very idea didn t you know his nickname wa ol one shot when he wa a boy why down at the landing when he wa coming up if he shot fifteen time and hit fourteen dove he d complain about wasting ammunition he never said anything about that jem muttered never said anything about it did he no ma am wonder why he never go huntin now i said maybe i can tell you said miss maudie if your father s anything he s civilized in his heart marksmanship s a gift of god a talent oh you have to practice to make it perfect but shootin s different from playing the piano or the like i think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that god had given him an unfair advantage over most living thing i guess he decided he wouldn t shoot till he had to and he had to today look like he d be proud of it i said people in their right mind never take pride in their talent said miss maudie we saw zeebo drive up he took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck and gingerly lifted tim johnson he pitched the dog onto the truck then poured something from a gallon jug on and around the spot where tim fell don t yawl come over here for a while he called when we went home i told jem we d really have something to talk about at school on monday jem turned on me don t say anything about it scout he said what i certainly am ain t everybody s daddy the deadest shot in maycomb county jem said i reckon if he d wanted u to know it he da told u if he wa proud of it he da told u maybe it just slipped his mind i said naw scout it s something you wouldn t understand atticus is real old but i wouldn t care if he couldn t do anything i wouldn t care if he couldn t do a blessed thing jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse running after it he called back atticus is a gentleman just like me content prev next chapter when we were small jem and i confined our activity to the southern neighborhood but when i wa well into the second grade at school and tormenting boo radley became passe the business section of maycomb drew u frequently up the street past the real property of mr henry lafayette dubose it wa impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way previous minor encounter with her left me with no desire for more but jem said i had to grow up some time mr dubose lived alone except for a negro girl in constant attendance two door up the street from u in a house with steep front step and a dog trot hall she wa very old she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair it wa rumored that she kept a csa pistol concealed among her numerous shawl and wrap jem and i hated her if she wa on the porch when we passed we would be raked by her wrathful gaze subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up which wa always nothing we had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of the street that only made her raise her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it we could do nothing to please her if i said a sunnily a i could hey mr dubose i would receive for an answer don t you say hey to me you ugly girl you say good afternoon mr dubose she wa vicious once she heard jem refer to our father a atticus and her reaction wa apoplectic besides being the sassiest most disrespectful mutt who ever passed her way we were told that it wa quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mother s death a lovelier lady than our mother never lived she said and it wa heartbreaking the way atticus finch let her child run wild i did not remember our mother but jem did he would tell me about her sometimes and he went livid when mr dubose shot u this message jem having survived boo radley a mad dog and other terror had concluded that it wa cowardly to stop at miss rachel s front step and wait and had decreed that we must run a far a the post office corner each evening to meet atticus coming from work countless evening atticus would find jem furious at something mr dubose had said when we went by easy doe it son atticus would say she s an old lady and she s ill you just hold your head high and be a gentleman whatever she say to you it s your job not to let her make you mad jem would say she must not be very sick she hollered so when the three of u came to her house atticus would sweep off his hat wave gallantly to her and say good evening mr dubose you look like a picture this evening i never heard atticus say like a picture of what he would tell her the courthouse news and would say he hoped with all his heart she d have a good day tomorrow he would return his hat to his head swing me to his shoulder in her very presence and we would go home in the twilight it wa time like these when i thought my father who hated gun and had never been to any war wa the bravest man who ever lived the day after jem s twelfth birthday his money wa burning up his pocket so we headed for town in the early afternoon jem thought he had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me i had long had my eye on that baton it wa at v j elmore s it wa bedecked with sequin and tinsel it cost seventeen cent it wa then my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the maycomb county high school band having developed my talent to where i could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down i had caused calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand i felt that i could overcome this defect with a real baton and i thought it generous of jem to buy one for me mr dubose wa stationed on her porch when we went by where are you two going at this time of day she shouted playing hooky i suppose i ll just call up the principal and tell him she put her hand on the wheel of her chair and executed a perfect right face aw it s saturday mr dubose said jem make no difference if it s saturday she said obscurely i wonder if your father know where you are mr dubose we ve been goin to town by ourselves since we were this high jem placed his hand palm down about two foot above the sidewalk don t you lie to me she yelled jeremy finch maudie atkinson told me you broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning she s going to tell your father and then you ll wish you never saw the light of day if you aren t sent to the reform school before next week my name s not dubose jem who hadn t been near miss maudie s scuppernong arbor since last summer and who knew miss maudie wouldn t tell atticus if he had issued a general denial don t you contradict me mr dubose bawled and you she pointed an arthritic finger at me what are you doing in those overall you should be in a dress and camisole young lady you ll grow up waiting on table if somebody doesn t change your way a finch waiting on table at the o k caf hah i wa terrified the o k caf wa a dim organization on the north side of the square i grabbed jem s hand but he shook me loose come on scout he whispered don t pay any attention to her just hold your head high and be a gentleman but mr dubose held u not only a finch waiting on table but one in the courthouse lawing for nigger jem stiffened mr dubose s shot had gone home and she knew it yes indeed what ha this world come to when a finch go against his raising i ll tell you she put her hand to her mouth when she drew it away it trailed a long silver thread of saliva your father s no better than the nigger and trash he work for jem wa scarlet i pulled at his sleeve and we were followed up the sidewalk by a philippic on our family s moral degeneration the major premise of which wa that half the finch were in the asylum anyway but if our mother were living we would not have come to such a state i wasn t sure what jem resented most but i took umbrage at mr dubose s assessment of the family s mental hygiene i had become almost accustomed to hearing insult aimed at atticus but this wa the first one coming from an adult except for her remark about atticus mr dubose s attack wa only routine there wa a hint of summer in the air in the shadow it wa cool but the sun wa warm which meant good time coming no school and dill jem bought his steam engine and we went by elmore s for my baton jem took no pleasure in his acquisition he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside me toward home on the way home i nearly hit mr link dea who said look out now scout when i missed a toss and when we approached mr dubose s house my baton wa grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many time she wa not on the porch in later year i sometimes wondered exactly what made jem do it what made him break the bond of you just be a gentleman son and the phase of selfconscious rectitude he had recently entered jem had probably stood a much guff about atticus lawing for nigger a had i and i took it for granted that he kept his temper he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse at the time however i thought the only explanation for what he did wa that for a few minute he simply went mad what jem did wa something i d do a a matter of course had i not been under atticus s interdict which i assumed included not fighting horrible old lady we had just come to her gate when jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the step into mr dubose s front yard forgetting everything atticus had said forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawl forgetting that if mr dubose missed her girl jessie probably wouldn t he did not begin to calm down until he had cut the top off every camellia bush mr dubose owned until the ground wa littered with green bud and leaf he bent my baton against his knee snapped it in two and threw it down by that time i wa shrieking jem yanked my hair said he didn t care he d do it again if he got a chance and if i didn t shut up he d pull every hair out of my head i didn t shut up and he kicked me i lost my balance and fell on my face jem picked me up roughly but looked like he wa sorry there wa nothing to say we did not choose to meet atticus coming home that evening we skulked around the kitchen until calpurnia threw u out by some voo doo system calpurnia seemed to know all about it she wa a less than satisfactory source of palliation but she did give jem a hot biscuit and butter which he tore in half and shared with me it tasted like cotton we went to the livingroom i picked up a football magazine found a picture of dixie howell showed it to jem and said this look like you that wa the nicest thing i could think to say to him but it wa no help he sat by the window hunched down in a rocking chair scowling waiting daylight faded two geological age later we heard the sol of atticus s shoe scrape the front step the screen door slammed there wa a pause atticus wa at the hat rack in the hall and we heard him call jem his voice wa like the winter wind atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found u there frozen still he carried my baton in one hand it filthy yellow tassel trailed on the rug he held out his other hand it contained fat camellia bud jem he said are you responsible for this yes sir why d you do it jem said softly she said you lawed for nigger and trash you did this because she said that jem s lip moved but his yes sir wa inaudible son i have no doubt that you ve been annoyed by your contemporary about me lawing for nigger a you say but to do something like this to a sick old lady is inexcusable i strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with mr dubose said atticus come straight home afterward jem did not move go on i said i followed jem out of the livingroom come back here atticus said to me i came back atticus picked up the mobile press and sat down in the rocking chair jem had vacated for the life of me i did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered with a confederate army relic of course jem antagonized me sometimes until i could kill him but when it came down to it he wa all i had atticus did not seem to realize this or if he did he didn t care i hated him for that but when you are in trouble you become easily tired soon i wa hiding in his lap and his arm were around me you re mighty big to be rocked he said you don t care what happens to him i said you just send him on to get shot at when all he wa doin wa standin up for you atticus pushed my head under his chin it s not time to worry yet he said i never thought jem d be the one to lose his head over this thought i d have more trouble with you i said i didn t see why we had to keep our head anyway that nobody i knew at school had to keep his head about anything scout said atticus when summer come you ll have to keep your head about far worse thing it s not fair for you and jem i know that but sometimes we have to make the best of thing and the way we conduct ourselves when the chip are down well all i can say is when you and jem are grown maybe you ll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that i didn t let you down this case tom robinson s case is something that go to the essence of a man s conscience scout i couldn t go to church and worship god if i didn t try to help that man atticus you must be wrong how s that well most folk seem to think they re right and you re wrong they re certainly entitled to think that and they re entitled to full respect for their opinion said atticus but before i can live with other folk i ve got to live with myself the one thing that doesn t abide by majority rule is a person s conscience when jem returned he found me still in atticus s lap well son said atticus he set me on my foot and i made a secret reconnaissance of jem he seemed to be all in one piece but he had a queer look on his face perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel i cleaned it up for her and said i wa sorry but i ain t and that i d work on em ever saturday and try to make em grow back out there wa no point in saying you were sorry if you aren t said atticus jem she s old and ill you can t hold her responsible for what she say and doe of course i d rather she d have said it to me than to either of you but we can t always have our druthers jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet atticus he said she want me to read to her read to her yes sir she want me to come every afternoon after school and saturday and read to her out loud for two hour atticus do i have to certainly but she want me to do it for a month then you ll do it for a month jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in finally he said atticus it s all right on the sidewalk but inside it s it s all dark and creepy there s shadow and thing on the ceiling atticus smiled grimly that should appeal to your imagination just pretend you re inside the radley house the following monday afternoon jem and i climbed the steep front step to mr dubose s house and padded down the open hallway jem armed with ivanhoe and full of superior knowledge knocked at the second door on the left mr dubose he called jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door is that you jem finch she said you got your sister with you i don t know let em both in jessie said mr dubose jessie admitted u and went off to the kitchen an oppressive odor met u when we crossed the threshold an odor i had met many time in rain rotted gray house where there are coal oil lamp water dipper and unbleached domestic sheet it always made me afraid expectant watchful in the corner of the room wa a brass bed and in the bed wa mr dubose i wondered if jem s activity had put her there and for a moment i felt sorry for her she wa lying under a pile of quilt and looked almost friendly there wa a marble topped washstand by her bed on it were a glass with a teaspoon in it a red ear syringe a box of absorbent cotton and a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny leg so you brought that dirty little sister of yours did you wa her greeting jem said quietly my sister ain t dirty and i ain t scared of you although i noticed his knee shaking i wa expecting a tirade but all she said wa you may commence reading jeremy jem sat down in a cane bottom chair and opened ivanhoe i pulled up another one and sat beside him come closer said mr dubose come to the side of the bed we moved our chair forward this wa the nearest i had ever been to her and the thing i wanted most to do wa move my chair back again she wa horrible her face wa the color of a dirty pillowcase and the corner of her mouth glistened with wet which inched like a glacier down the deep groove enclosing her chin old age liver spot dotted her cheek and her pale eye had black pinpoint pupil her hand were knobby and the cuticle were grown up over her fingernail her bottom plate wa not in and her upper lip protruded from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it this made the wet move faster i didn t look any more than i had to jem reopened ivanhoe and began reading i tried to keep up with him but he read too fast when jem came to a word he didn t know he skipped it but mr dubose would catch him and make him spell it out jem read for perhaps twenty minute during which time i looked at the soot stained mantelpiece out the window anywhere to keep from looking at her a he read along i noticed that mr dubose s correction grew fewer and farther between that jem had even left one sentence dangling in mid air she wa not listening i looked toward the bed something had happened to her she lay on her back with the quilt up to her chin only her head and shoulder were visible her head moved slowly from side to side from time to time she would open her mouth wide and i could see her tongue undulate faintly cord of saliva would collect on her lip she would draw them in then open her mouth again her mouth seemed to have a private existence of it own it worked separate and apart from the rest of her out and in like a clam hole at low tide occasionally it would say pt like some viscous substance coming to a boil i pulled jem s sleeve he looked at me then at the bed her head made it regular sweep toward u and jem said mr dubose are you all right she did not hear him the alarm clock went off and scared u stiff a minute later nerve still tingling jem and i were on the sidewalk headed for home we did not run away jessie sent u before the clock wound down she wa in the room pushing jem and me out of it shoo she said you all go home jem hesitated at the door it s time for her medicine jessie said a the door swung shut behind u i saw jessie walking quickly toward mr dubose s bed it wa only three forty five when we got home so jem and i drop kicked in the back yard until it wa time to meet atticus atticus had two yellow pencil for me and a football magazine for jem which i suppose wa a silent reward for our first day s session with mr dubose jem told him what happened did she frighten you asked atticus no sir said jem but she s so nasty she ha fit or somethin she spit a lot she can t help that when people are sick they don t look nice sometimes she scared me i said atticus looked at me over his glass you don t have to go with jem you know the next afternoon at mr dubose s wa the same a the first and so wa the next until gradually a pattern emerged everything would begin normally that is mr dubose would hound jem for a while on her favorite subject her camellia and our father s nigger loving propensity she would grow increasingly silent then go away from u the alarm clock would ring jessie would shoo u out and the rest of the day wa ours atticus i said one evening what exactly is a nigger lover atticus s face wa grave ha somebody been calling you that no sir mr dubose call you that she warms up every afternoon calling you that francis called me that last christmas that s where i first heard it is that the reason you jumped on him asked atticus yes sir then why are you asking me what it mean i tried to explain to atticus that it wasn t so much what francis said that had infuriated me a the way he had said it it wa like he d said snot nose or somethin scout said atticus nigger lover is just one of those term that don t mean anything like snot nose it s hard to explain ignorant trashy people use it when they think somebody s favoring negro over and above themselves it s slipped into usage with some people like ourselves when they want a common ugly term to label somebody you aren t really a nigger lover then are you i certainly am i do my best to love everybody i m hard put sometimes baby it s never an insult to be called what somebody think is a bad name it just show you how poor that person is it doesn t hurt you so don t let mr dubose get you down she ha enough trouble of her own one afternoon a month later jem wa ploughing his way through sir walter scout a jem called him and mr dubose wa correcting him at every turn when there wa a knock on the door come in she screamed atticus came in he went to the bed and took mr dubose s hand i wa coming from the office and didn t see the child he said i thought they might still be here mr dubose smiled at him for the life of me i could not figure out how she could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so do you know what time it is atticus she said exactly fourteen minute past five the alarm clock s set for five thirty i want you to know that it suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at mr dubose s that the alarm clock went off a few minute later every day and that she wa well into one of her fit by the time it sounded today she had antagonized jem for nearly two hour with no intention of having a fit and i felt hopelessly trapped the alarm clock wa the signal for our release if one day it did not ring what would we do i have a feeling that jem s reading day are numbered said atticus only a week longer i think she said just to make sure jem rose but atticus put out his hand and jem wa silent on the way home jem said he had to do it just for a month and the month wa up and it wasn t fair just one more week son said atticus no said jem yes said atticus the following week found u back at mr dubose s the alarm clock had ceased sounding but mr dubose would release u with that ll do so late in the afternoon atticus would be home reading the paper when we returned although her fit had passed off she wa in every other way her old self when sir walter scott became involved in lengthy description of moat and castle mr dubose would become bored and pick on u jeremy finch i told you you d live to regret tearing up my camellia you regret it now don t you jem would say he certainly did thought you could kill my snow on the mountain did you well jessie say the top s growing back out next time you ll know how to do it right won t you you ll pull it up by the root won t you jem would say he certainly would don t you mutter at me boy you hold up your head and say yes ma am don t guess you feel like holding it up though with your father what he is jem s chin would come up and he would gaze at mr dubose with a face devoid of resentment through the week he had cultivated an expression of polite and detached interest which he would present to her in answer to her most blood curdling invention at last the day came when mr dubose said that ll do one afternoon she added and that s all good day to you it wa over we bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief leaping and howling that spring wa a good one the day grew longer and gave u more playing time jem s mind wa occupied mostly with the vital statistic of every college football player in the nation every night atticus would read u the sport page of the newspaper alabama might go to the rose bowl again this year judging from it prospect not one of whose name we could pronounce atticus wa in the middle of windy seaton s column one evening when the telephone rang he answered it then went to the hat rack in the hall i m going down to mr dubose s for a while he said i won t be long but atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime when he returned he wa carrying a candy box atticus sat down in the livingroom and put the box on the floor beside his chair what d she want asked jem we had not seen mr dubose for over a month she wa never on the porch any more when we passed she s dead son said atticus she died a few minute ago oh said jem well well is right said atticus she s not suffering any more she wa sick for a long time son didn t you know what her fit were jem shook his head mr dubose wa a morphine addict said atticus she took it a a pain killer for year the doctor put her on it she d have spent the rest of her life on it and died without so much agony but she wa too contrary sir said jem atticus said just before your escapade she called me to make her will dr reynolds told her she had only a few month left her business affair were in perfect order but she said there s still one thing out of order what wa that jem wa perplexed she said she wa going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody jem when you re sick a she wa it s all right to take anything to make it easier but it wasn t all right for her she said she meant to break herself of it before she died and that s what she did jem said you mean that s what her fit were yes that s what they were most of the time you were reading to her i doubt if she heard a word you said her whole mind and body were concentrated on that alarm clock if you hadn t fallen into her hand i d have made you go read to her anyway it may have been some distraction there wa another reason did she die free asked jem a the mountain air said atticus she wa conscious to the last almost conscious he smiled and cantankerous she still disapproved heartily of my doings and said i d probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail she had jessie fix you this box atticus reached down and picked up the candy box he handed it to jem jem opened the box inside surrounded by wad of damp cotton wa a white waxy perfect camellia it wa a snow on the mountain jem s eye nearly popped out of his head old hell devil old hell devil he screamed flinging it down why can t she leave me alone in a flash atticus wa up and standing over him jem buried his face in atticus s shirt front sh h he said i think that wa her way of telling you everything s all right now jem everything s all right you know she wa a great lady a lady jem raised his head his face wa scarlet after all those thing she said about you a lady she wa she had her own view about thing a lot different from mine maybe son i told you that if you hadn t lost your head i d have made you go read to her i wanted you to see something about her i wanted you to see what real courage is instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand it s when you know you re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what you rarely win but sometimes you do mr dubose won all ninety eight pound of her according to her view she died beholden to nothing and nobody she wa the bravest person i ever knew jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire he picked up the camellia and when i went off to bed i saw him fingering the wide petal atticus wa reading the paper part two content prev next chapter jem wa twelve he wa difficult to live with inconsistent moody his appetite wa appalling and he told me so many time to stop pestering him i consulted atticus reckon he s got a tapeworm atticus said no jem wa growing i must be patient with him and disturb him a little a possible this change in jem had come about in a matter of week mr dubose wa not cold in her grave jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to read to her overnight it seemed jem had acquired an alien set of value and wa trying to impose them on me several time he went so far a to tell me what to do after one altercation when jem hollered it s time you started bein a girl and acting right i burst into tear and fled to calpurnia don t you fret too much over mister jem she began mister jem yeah he s just about mister jem now he ain t that old i said all he need is somebody to beat him up and i ain t big enough baby said calpurnia i just can t help it if mister jem s growin up he s gon na want to be off to himself a lot now doin whatever boy do so you just come right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome we ll find lot of thing to do in here the beginning of that summer boded well jem could do a he pleased calpurnia would do until dill came she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the kitchen and by watching her i began to think there wa some skill involved in being a girl but summer came and dill wa not there i received a letter and a snapshot from him the letter said he had a new father whose picture wa enclosed and he would have to stay in meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat his father wa a lawyer like atticus only much younger dill s new father had a pleasant face which made me glad dill had captured him but i wa crushed dill concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry he would come get me and marry me a soon a he got enough money together so please write the fact that i had a permanent fianc wa little compensation for his absence i had never thought about it but summer wa dill by the fishpool smoking string dill s eye alive with complicated plan to make boo radley emerge summer wa the swiftness with which dill would reach up and kiss me when jem wa not looking the longing we sometimes felt each other feel with him life wa routine without him life wa unbearable i stayed miserable for two day a if that were not enough the state legislature wa called into emergency session and atticus left u for two week the governor wa eager to scrape a few barnacle off the ship of state there were sit down strike in birmingham bread line in the city grew longer people in the country grew poorer but these were event remote from the world of jem and me we were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the montgomery advertiser above the caption maycomb s finch it showed atticus barefooted and in short pant chained to a desk he wa diligently writing on a slate while some frivolouslooking girl yelled yoo hoo at him that s a compliment explained jem he spends his time doin thing that wouldn t get done if nobody did em huh in addition to jem s newly developed characteristic he had acquired a maddening air of wisdom oh scout it s like reorganizing the tax system of the county and thing that kind of thing s pretty dry to most men how do you know oh go on and leave me alone i m readin the paper jem got his wish i departed for the kitchen while she wa shelling pea calpurnia suddenly said what am i gon na do about you all s church this sunday nothing i reckon atticus left u collection calpurnia s eye narrowed and i could tell what wa going through her mind cal i said you know we ll behave we haven t done anything in church in year calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy sunday when we were both fatherless and teacherless left to it own device the class tied eunice ann simpson to a chair and placed her in the furnace room we forgot her trooped upstairs to church and were listening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipe persisting until someone investigated and brought forth eunice ann saying she didn t want to play shadrach any more jem finch said she wouldn t get burnt if she had enough faith but it wa hot down there besides cal this isn t the first time atticus ha left u i protested yeah but he make certain your teacher s gon na be there i didn t hear him say this time reckon he forgot it calpurnia scratched her head suddenly she smiled how d you and mister jem like to come to church with me tomorrow really how bout it grinned calpurnia if calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before it wa nothing compared to her supervision of that saturday night s routine she made me soap all over twice drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with octagon soap and castile she had trusted jem for year but that night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst can t anybody take a bath in this house without the whole family lookin next morning she began earlier than usual to go over our clothes when calpurnia stayed overnight with u she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen that morning it wa covered with our sunday habiliment she had put so much starch in my dress it came up like a tent when i sat down she made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist she went over my patentleather shoe with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them it s like we were goin to mardi gras said jem what s all this for cal i don t want anybody sayin i don t look after my child she muttered mister jem you absolutely can t wear that tie with that suit it s green smatter with that suit s blue can t you tell hee hee i howled jem s color blind his face flushed angrily but calpurnia said now you all quit that you re gon na go to first purchase with smile on your face first purchase african m e church wa in the quarter outside the southern town limit across the old sawmill track it wa an ancient paint peeled frame building the only church in maycomb with a steeple and bell called first purchase because it wa paid for from the first earnings of freed slave negro worshiped in it on sunday and white men gambled in it on weekday the churchyard wa brick hard clay a wa the cemetery beside it if someone died during a dry spell the body wa covered with chunk of ice until rain softened the earth a few graf in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstone newer one were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken coca cola bottle lightning rod guarding some graf denoted dead who rested uneasily stump of burned out candle stood at the head of infant graf it wa a happy cemetery the warm bittersweet smell of clean negro welcomed u a we entered the churchyard heart of love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida snuff hoyt s cologne brown s mule peppermint and lilac talcum when they saw jem and me with calpurnia the men stepped back and took off their hat the woman crossed their arm at their waist weekday gesture of respectful attention they parted and made a small pathway to the church door for u calpurnia walked between jem and me responding to the greeting of her brightly clad neighbor what you up to miss cal said a voice behind u calpurnia s hand went to our shoulder and we stopped and looked around standing in the path behind u wa a tall negro woman her weight wa on one leg she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip pointing at u with upturned palm she wa bullet headed with strange almond shaped eye straight nose and an indian bow mouth she seemed seven foot high i felt calpurnia s hand dig into my shoulder what you want lula she asked in tone i had never heard her use she spoke quietly contemptuously i want to know why you bringin white chillun to nigger church they s my comp ny said calpurnia again i thought her voice strange she wa talking like the rest of them yeah an i reckon you s comp ny at the finch house durin the week a murmur ran through the crowd don t you fret calpurnia whispered to me but the rose on her hat trembled indignantly when lula came up the pathway toward u calpurnia said stop right there nigger lula stopped but she said you ain t got no business bringin white chillun here they got their church we got our n it is our church ain t it miss cal calpurnia said it s the same god ain t it jem said let s go home cal they don t want u here i agreed they did not want u here i sensed rather than saw that we were being advanced upon they seemed to be drawing closer to u but when i looked up at calpurnia there wa amusement in her eye when i looked down the pathway again lula wa gone in her place wa a solid mass of colored people one of them stepped from the crowd it wa zeebo the garbage collector mister jem he said we re mighty glad to have you all here don t pay no tention to lula she s contentious because reverend sykes threatened to church her she s a troublemaker from way back got fancy idea an haughty way we re mighty glad to have you all with that calpurnia led u to the church door where we were greeted by reverend sykes who led u to the front pew first purchase wa unceiled and unpainted within along it wall unlighted kerosene lamp hung on brass bracket pine bench served a pew behind the rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed god is love the church s only decoration except a rotogravure print of hunt s the light of the world there wa no sign of piano organ hymn book church program the familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw every sunday it wa dim inside with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation at each seat wa a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish garden of gethsemane courtesy tyndal s hardware co you name it we sell it calpurnia motioned jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between u she fished in her purse drew out her handkerchief and untied the hard wad of change in it corner she gave a dime to me and a dime to jem we ve got ours he whispered you keep it calpurnia said you re my company jem s face showed brief indecision on the ethic of withholding his own dime but his innate courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket i did likewise with no qualm cal i whispered where are the hymn book we don t have any she said well how sh h she said reverend sykes wa standing behind the pulpit staring the congregation to silence he wa a short stocky man in a black suit black tie white shirt and a gold watch chain that glinted in the light from the frosted window he said brother and sister we are particularly glad to have company with u this morning mister and miss finch you all know their father before i begin i will read some announcement reverend sykes shuffled some paper chose one and held it at arm s length the missionary society meet in the home of sister annette reef next tuesday bring your sewing he read from another paper you all know of brother tom robinson s trouble he ha been a faithful member of first purchase since he wa a boy the collection taken up today and for the next three sunday will go to helen his wife to help her out at home i punched jem that s the tom atticus s de sh h i turned to calpurnia but wa hushed before i opened my mouth subdued i fixed my attention upon reverend sykes who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down will the music superintendent lead u in the first hymn he said zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle stopping in front of u and facing the congregation he wa carrying a battered hymn book he opened it and said we ll sing number two seventy three this wa too much for me how re we gon na sing it if there ain t any hymnbook calpurnia smiled hush baby she whispered you ll see in a minute zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery there s a land beyond the river miraculously on pitch a hundred voice sang out zeebo s word the last syllable held to a husky hum wa followed by zeebo saying that we call the sweet forever music again swelled around u the last note lingered and zeebo met it with the next line and we only reach that shore by faith s decree the congregation hesitated zeebo repeated the line carefully and it wa sung at the chorus zeebo closed the book a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help on the dying note of jubilee zeebo said in that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river line for line voice followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy murmur i looked at jem who wa looking at zeebo from the corner of his eye i didn t believe it either but we had both heard it reverend sykes then called on the lord to bless the sick and the suffering a procedure no different from our church practice except reverend sykes directed the deity s attention to several specific case his sermon wa a forthright denunciation of sin an austere declaration of the motto on the wall behind him he warned his flock against the evil of heady brew gambling and strange woman bootlegger caused enough trouble in the quarter but woman were worse again a i had often met it in my own church i wa confronted with the impurity of woman doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergyman jem and i had heard the same sermon sunday after sunday with only one exception reverend sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his view on individual lapse from grace jim hardy had been absent from church for five sunday and he wasn t sick constance jackson had better watch her way she wa in grave danger for quarreling with her neighbor she had erected the only spite fence in the history of the quarter reverend sykes closed his sermon he stood beside a table in front of the pulpit and requested the morning offering a proceeding that wa strange to jem and me one by one the congregation came forward and dropped nickel and dime into a black enameled coffee can jem and i followed suit and received a soft thank you thank you a our dime clinked to our amazement reverend sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the coin into his hand he straightened up and said this is not enough we must have ten dollar the congregation stirred you all know what it s for helen can t leave those child to work while tom s in jail if everybody give one more dime we ll have it reverend sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church alec shut the door nobody leaf here till we have ten dollar calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin purse naw cal jem whispered when she handed him a shiny quarter we can put ours in gim me your dime scout the church wa becoming stuffy and it occurred to me that reverend sykes intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock fan crackled foot shuffled tobacco chewer were in agony reverend sykes startled me by saying sternly carlow richardson i haven t seen you up this aisle yet a thin man in khaki pant came up the aisle and deposited a coin the congregation murmured approval reverend sykes then said i want all of you with no child to make a sacrifice and give one more dime apiece then we ll have it slowly painfully the ten dollar wa collected the door wa opened and the gust of warm air revived u zeebo lined on jordan s stormy bank and church wa over i wanted to stay and explore but calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her at the church door while she paused to talk with zeebo and his family jem and i chatted with reverend sykes i wa bursting with question but decided i would wait and let calpurnia answer them we were specially glad to have you all here said reverend sykes this church ha no better friend than your daddy my curiosity burst why were you all takin up collection for tom robinson s wife didn t you hear why asked reverend sykes helen s got three little un and she can t go out to work why can t she take em with her reverend i asked it wa customary for field negro with tiny child to deposit them in whatever shade there wa while their parent worked usually the baby sat in the shade between two row of cotton those unable to sit were strapped papoose style on their mother back or resided in extra cotton bag reverend sykes hesitated to tell you the truth miss jean louise helen s finding it hard to get work these day when it s picking time i think mr link dea ll take her why not reverend before he could answer i felt calpurnia s hand on my shoulder at it pressure i said we thank you for lettin u come jem echoed me and we made our way homeward cal i know tom robinson s in jail an he s done somethin awful but why won t folk hire helen i asked calpurnia in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat walked between jem and me it s because of what folk say tom s done she said folk aren t anxious to to have anything to do with any of his family just what did he do cal calpurnia sighed old mr bob ewell accused him of rapin his girl an had him arrested an put in jail mr ewell my memory stirred doe he have anything to do with those ewells that come every first day of school an then go home why atticus said they were absolute trash i never heard atticus talk about folk the way he talked about the ewells he said yeah those are the one well if everybody in maycomb know what kind of folk the ewells are they d be glad to hire helen what s rape cal it s somethin you ll have to ask mr finch about she said he can explain it better than i can you all hungry the reverend took a long time unwindin this morning he s not usually so tedious he s just like our preacher said jem but why do you all sing hymn that way linin she asked is that what it is yeah it s called linin they ve done it that way a long a i can remember jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get some hymn book calpurnia laughed wouldn t do any good she said they can t read can t read i asked all those folk that s right calpurnia nodded can t but about four folk in first purchase read i m one of em where d you go to school cal asked jem nowhere let s see now who taught me my letter it wa miss maudie atkinson s aunt old miss buford are you that old i m older than mr finch even calpurnia grinned not sure how much though we started rememberin one time trying to figure out how old i wa i can remember back just a few year more n he can so i m not much older when you take off the fact that men can t remember a well a woman what s your birthday cal i just have it on christmas it s easier to remember that way i don t have a real birthday but cal jem protested you don t look even near a old a atticus colored folk don t show their age so fast she said maybe because they can t read cal did you teach zeebo yeah mister jem there wasn t a school even when he wa a boy i made him learn though zeebo wa calpurnia s eldest son if i had ever thought about it i would have known that calpurnia wa of mature year zeebo had half grown child but then i had never thought about it did you teach him out of a primer like u i asked no i made him get a page of the bible every day and there wa a book miss buford taught me out of bet you don t know where i got it she said we didn t know calpurnia said your granddaddy finch gave it to me were you from the landing jem asked you never told u that i certainly am mister jem grew up down there between the buford place and the landin i ve spent all my day workin for the finch or the bufords an i moved to maycomb when your daddy and your mamma married what wa the book cal i asked blackstone s commentary jem wa thunderstruck you mean you taught zeebo outa that why yes sir mister jem calpurnia timidly put her finger to her mouth they were the only book i had your grandaddy said mr blackstone wrote fine english that s why you don t talk like the rest of em said jem the rest of who rest of the colored folk cal but you talked like they did in church that calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me the idea that she had a separate existence outside our household wa a novel one to say nothing of her having command of two language cal i asked why do you talk niggertalk to the to your folk when you know it s not right well in the first place i m black that doesn t mean you hafta talk that way when you know better said jem calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head then pressed her hat down carefully over her ear it s right hard to say she said suppose you and scout talked colored folk talk at home it d be out of place wouldn t it now what if i talked white folk talk at church and with my neighbor they d think i wa puttin on air to beat moses but cal you know better i said it s not necessary to tell all you know it s not ladylike in the second place folk don t like to have somebody around knowin more than they do it aggravates em you re not gon na change any of them by talkin right they ve got to want to learn themselves and when they don t want to learn there s nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language cal can i come to see you sometimes she looked down at me see me honey you see me every day out to your house i said sometimes after work atticus can get me any time you want to she said we d be glad to have you we were on the sidewalk by the radley place look on the porch yonder jem said i looked over to the radley place expecting to see it phantom occupant sunning himself in the swing the swing wa empty i mean our porch said jem i looked down the street enarmored upright uncompromising aunt alexandra wa sitting in a rocking chair exactly a if she had sat there every day of her life content prev next chapter put my bag in the front bedroom calpurnia wa the first thing aunt alexandra said jean louise stop scratching your head wa the second thing she said calpurnia picked up aunty s heavy suitcase and opened the door i ll take it said jem and took it i heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump the sound had a dull permanence about it have you come for a visit aunty i asked aunt alexandra s visit from the landing were rare and she traveled in state she owned a bright green square buick and a black chauffeur both kept in an unhealthy state of tidiness but today they were nowhere to be seen didn t your father tell you she asked jem and i shook our head probably he forgot he s not in yet is he nome he doesn t usually get back till late afternoon said jem well your father and i decided it wa time i came to stay with you for a while for a while in maycomb meant anything from three day to thirty year jem and i exchanged glance jem s growing up now and you are too she said to me we decided that it would be best for you to have some feminine influence it won t be many year jean louise before you become interested in clothes and boy i could have made several answer to this cal s a girl it would be many year before i would be interested in boy i would never be interested in clothes but i kept quiet what about uncle jimmy asked jem is he comin too oh no he s staying at the landing he ll keep the place going the moment i said won t you miss him i realized that this wa not a tactful question uncle jimmy present or uncle jimmy absent made not much difference he never said anything aunt alexandra ignored my question i could think of nothing else to say to her in fact i could never think of anything to say to her and i sat thinking of past painful conversation between u how are you jean louise fine thank you ma am how are you very well thank you what have you been doing with yourself nothin don t you do anything nome certainly you have friend yessum well what do you all do nothin it wa plain that aunty thought me dull in the extreme because i once heard her tell atticus that i wa sluggish there wa a story behind all this but i had no desire to extract it from her then today wa sunday and aunt alexandra wa positively irritable on the lord s day i guess it wa her sunday corset she wa not fat but solid and she chose protective garment that drew up her bosom to giddy height pinched in her waist flared out her rear and managed to suggest that aunt alexandra s wa once an hour glass figure from any angle it wa formidable the remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when relative appear but wa dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway it wa atticus home from montgomery jem forgetting his dignity ran with me to meet him jem seized his briefcase and bag i jumped into his arm felt his vague dry kiss and said d you bring me a book d you know aunty s here atticus answered both question in the affirmative how d you like for her to come live with u i said i would like it very much which wa a lie but one must lie under certain circumstance and at all time when one can t do anything about them we felt it wa time you child needed well it s like this scout atticus said your aunt s doing me a favor a well a you all i can t stay here all day with you and the summer s going to be a hot one yes sir i said not understanding a word he said i had an idea however that aunt alexandra s appearance on the scene wa not so much atticus s doing a hers aunty had a way of declaring what is best for the family and i suppose her coming to live with u wa in that category maycomb welcomed her miss maudie atkinson baked a lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight miss stephanie crawford had long visit with aunt alexandra consisting mostly of miss stephanie shaking her head and saying uh uh uh miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afternoon and mr nathan radley went so far a to come up in the front yard and say he wa glad to see her when she settled in with u and life resumed it daily pace aunt alexandra seemed a if she had always lived with u her missionary society refreshment added to her reputation a a hostess she did not permit calpurnia to make the delicacy required to sustain the society through long report on rice christian she joined and became secretary of the maycomb amanuensis club to all party present and participating in the life of the county aunt alexandra wa one of the last of her kind she had river boat boarding school manner let any moral come along and she would uphold it she wa born in the objective case she wa an incurable gossip when aunt alexandra went to school self doubt could not be found in any textbook so she knew not it meaning she wa never bored and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative she would arrange advise caution and warn she never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcoming of other tribal group to the greater glory of our own a habit that amused jem rather than annoyed him aunty better watch how she talk scratch most folk in maycomb and they re kin to u aunt alexandra in underlining the moral of young sam merriweather s suicide said it wa caused by a morbid streak in the family let a sixteen year old girl giggle in the choir and aunty would say it just go to show you all the penfield woman are flighty everybody in maycomb it seemed had a streak a drinking streak a gambling streak a mean streak a funny streak once when aunty assured u that miss stephanie crawford s tendency to mind other people s business wa hereditary atticus said sister when you stop to think about it our generation s practically the first in the finch family not to marry it cousin would you say the finch have an incestuous streak aunty said no that s where we got our small hand and foot i never understood her preoccupation with heredity somewhere i had received the impression that fine folk were people who did the best they could with the sense they had but aunt alexandra wa of the opinion obliquely expressed that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it wa that make the ewells fine folk then said jem the tribe of which burris ewell and his brother consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the maycomb dump and had thrived on county welfare money for three generation aunt alexandra s theory had something behind it though maycomb wa an ancient town it wa twenty mile east of finch s landing awkwardly inland for such an old town but maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble wittedness of one sinkfield who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig trail met the only tavern in the territory sinkfield no patriot served and supplied ammunition to indian and settler alike neither knowing or caring whether he wa a part of the alabama territory or the creek nation so long a business wa good business wa excellent when governor william wyatt bibb with a view to promoting the newly created county s domestic tranquility dispatched a team of surveyor to locate it exact center and there establish it seat of government the surveyor sinkfield s guest told their host that he wa in the territorial confines of maycomb county and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built had not sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holding maycomb would have sat in the middle of winston swamp a place totally devoid of interest instead maycomb grew and sprawled out from it hub sinkfield s tavern because sinkfield reduced his guest to myopic drunkenness one evening induced them to bring forward their map and chart lop off a little here add a bit there and adjust the center of the county to meet his requirement he sent them packing next day armed with their chart and five quart of shinny in their saddlebag two apiece and one for the governor because it primary reason for existence wa government maycomb wa spared the grubbiness that distinguished most alabama town it size in the beginning it building were solid it courthouse proud it street graciously wide maycomb s proportion of professional people ran high one went there to have his teeth pulled his wagon fixed his heart listened to his money deposited his soul saved his mule vetted but the ultimate wisdom of sinkfield s maneuver is open to question he placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public transportation in those day river boat and it took a man from the north end of the county two day to travel to maycomb for store bought good a a result the town remained the same size for a hundred year an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland although maycomb wa ignored during the war between the state reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow it grew inward new people so rarely settled there the same family married the same family until the member of the community looked faintly alike occasionally someone would return from montgomery or mobile with an outsider but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance thing were more or less the same during my early year there wa indeed a caste system in maycomb but to my mind it worked this way the older citizen the present generation of people who had lived side by side for year and year were utterly predictable to one another they took for granted attitude character shading even gesture a having been repeated in each generation and refined by time thus the dictum no crawford mind his own business every third merriweather is morbid the truth is not in the delafields all the bufords walk like that were simply guide to daily living never take a check from a delafield without a discreet call to the bank miss maudie atkinson s shoulder stoop because she wa a buford if mr grace merriweather sip gin out of lydia e pinkham bottle it s nothing unusual her mother did the same aunt alexandra fitted into the world of maycomb like a hand into a glove but never into the world of jem and me i so often wondered how she could be atticus s and uncle jack s sister that i revived half remembered tale of changeling and mandrake root that jem had spun long ago these were abstract speculation for the first month of her stay a she had little to say to jem or me and we saw her only at mealtime and at night before we went to bed it wa summer and we were outdoors of course some afternoon when i would run inside for a drink of water i would find the livingroom overrun with maycomb lady sipping whispering fanning and i would be called jean louise come speak to these lady when i appeared in the doorway aunty would look a if she regretted her request i wa usually mud splashed or covered with sand speak to your cousin lily she said one afternoon when she had trapped me in the hall who i said your cousin lily brooke said aunt alexandra she our cousin i didn t know that aunt alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to cousin lily and firm disapproval to me when cousin lily brooke left i knew i wa in for it it wa a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the finch family or to install any pride into his child she summoned jem who sat warily on the sofa beside me she left the room and returned with a purple covered book on which meditation of joshua s st clair wa stamped in gold your cousin wrote this said aunt alexandra he wa a beautiful character jem examined the small volume is this the cousin joshua who wa locked up for so long aunt alexandra said how did you know that why atticus said he went round the bend at the university said he tried to shoot the president said cousin joshua said he wasn t anything but a sewerinspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol only it just blew up in his hand atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollar to get him out of that one aunt alexandra wa standing stiff a a stork that s all she said we ll see about this before bedtime i wa in jem s room trying to borrow a book when atticus knocked and entered he sat on the side of jem s bed looked at u soberly then he grinned er h rm he said he wa beginning to preface some thing he said with a throaty noise and i thought he must at last be getting old but he looked the same i don t exactly know how to say this he began well just say it said jem have we done something our father wa actually fidgeting no i just want to explain to you that your aunt alexandra asked me son you know you re a finch don t you that s what i ve been told jem looked out of the corner of his eye his voice rose uncontrollably atticus what s the matter atticus crossed his knee and folded his arm i m trying to tell you the fact of life jem s disgust deepened i know all that stuff he said atticus suddenly grew serious in his lawyer s voice without a shade of inflection he said your aunt ha asked me to try and impress upon you and jean louise that you are not from run of the mill people that you are the product of several generation gentle breeding atticus paused watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg gentle breeding he continued when i had found and scratched it and that you should try to live up to your name atticus persevered in spite of u she asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are she want to talk to you about the family and what it s meant to maycomb county through the year so you ll have some idea of who you are so you might be moved to behave accordingly he concluded at a gallop stunned jem and i looked at each other then at atticus whose collar seemed to worry him we did not speak to him presently i picked up a comb from jem s dresser and ran it teeth along the edge stop that noise atticus said his curtness stung me the comb wa midway in it journey and i banged it down for no reason i felt myself beginning to cry but i could not stop this wa not my father my father never thought these thought my father never spoke so aunt alexandra had put him up to this somehow through my tear i saw jem standing in a similar pool of isolation his head cocked to one side there wa nowhere to go but i turned to go and met atticus s vest front i buried my head in it and listened to the small internal noise that went on behind the light blue cloth his watch ticking the faint crackle of his starched shirt the soft sound of his breathing your stomach s growling i said i know it he said you better take some soda i will he said atticus is all this behavin an stuff gon na make thing different i mean are you i felt his hand on the back of my head don t you worry about anything he said it s not time to worry when i heard that i knew he had come back to u the blood in my leg began to flow again and i raised my head you really want u to do all that i can t remember everything finch are supposed to do i don t want you to remember it forget it he went to the door and out of the room shutting the door behind him he nearly slammed it but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly a jem and i stared the door opened again and atticus peered around his eyebrow were raised his glass had slipped get more like cousin joshua every day don t i do you think i ll end up costing the family five hundred dollar i know now what he wa trying to do but atticus wa only a man it take a woman to do that kind of work content prev next chapter although we heard no more about the finch family from aunt alexandra we heard plenty from the town on saturday armed with our nickel when jem permitted me to accompany him he wa now positively allergic to my presence when in public we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowd and sometimes hear there s his chillun or yonder s some finch turning to face our accuser we would see only a couple of farmer studying the enema bag in the mayco drugstore window or two dumpy countrywoman in straw hat sitting in a hoover cart they c n go loose and rape up the countryside for all of em who run this county care wa one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when he passed u which reminded me that i had a question to ask atticus what s rape i asked him that night atticus looked around from behind his paper he wa in his chair by the window a we grew older jem and i thought it generous to allow atticus thirty minute to himself after supper he sighed and said rape wa carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent well if that s all it is why did calpurnia dry me up when i asked her what it wa atticus looked pensive what s that again well i asked calpurnia comin from church that day what it wa and she said ask you but i forgot to and now i m askin you his paper wa now in his lap again please he said i told him in detail about our trip to church with calpurnia atticus seemed to enjoy it but aunt alexandra who wa sitting in a corner quietly sewing put down her embroidery and stared at u you all were coming back from calpurnia s church that sunday jem said yessum she took u i remembered something yessum and she promised me i could come out to her house some afternoon atticus i ll go next sunday if it s all right can i cal said she d come get me if you were off in the car you may not aunt alexandra said it i wheeled around startled then turned back to atticus in time to catch his swift glance at her but it wa too late i said i didn t ask you for a big man atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone i ever knew he wa on his foot apologize to your aunt he said i didn t ask her i asked you atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye his voice wa deadly first apologize to your aunt i m sorry aunty i muttered now then he said let s get this clear you do a calpurnia tell you you do a i tell you and a long a your aunt s in this house you will do a she tell you understand i understood pondered a while and concluded that the only way i could retire with a shred of dignity wa to go to the bathroom where i stayed long enough to make them think i had to go returning i lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on in the livingroom through the door i could see jem on the sofa with a football magazine in front of his face his head turning a if it page contained a live tennis match you ve got to do something about her aunty wa saying you ve let thing go on too long atticus too long i don t see any harm in letting her go out there cal d look after her there a well a she doe here who wa the her they were talking about my heart sank me i felt the starched wall of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me and for the second time in my life i thought of running away immediately atticus it s all right to be soft hearted you re an easy man but you have a daughter to think of a daughter who s growing up that s what i am thinking of and don t try to get around it you ve got to face it sooner or later and it might a well be tonight we don t need her now atticus s voice wa even alexandra calpurnia s not leaving this house until she want to you may think otherwise but i couldn t have got along without her all these year she s a faithful member of this family and you ll simply have to accept thing the way they are besides sister i don t want you working your head off for u you ve no reason to do that we still need cal a much a we ever did but atticus besides i don t think the child ve suffered one bit from her having brought them up if anything she s been harder on them in some way than a mother would have been she s never let them get away with anything she s never indulged them the way most colored nurse do she tried to bring them up according to her light and cal s light are pretty good and another thing the child love her i breathed again it wasn t me it wa only calpurnia they were talking about revived i entered the livingroom atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and aunt alexandra wa worrying her embroidery punk punk punk her needle broke the taut circle she stopped and pulled the cloth tighter punk punk punk she wa furious jem got up and padded across the rug he motioned me to follow he led me to his room and closed the door his face wa grave they ve been fussing scout jem and i fussed a great deal these day but i had never heard of or seen anyone quarrel with atticus it wa not a comfortable sight scout try not to antagonize aunty hear atticus s remark were still rankling which made me miss the request in jem s question my feather rose again you tryin to tell me what to do naw it s he s got a lot on his mind now without u worrying him like what atticus didn t appear to have anything especially on his mind it s this tom robinson case that s worryin him to death i said atticus didn t worry about anything besides the case never bothered u except about once a week and then it didn t last that s because you can t hold something in your mind but a little while said jem it s different with grown folk we his maddening superiority wa unbearable these day he didn t want to do anything but read and go off by himself still everything he read he passed along to me but with this difference formerly because he thought i d like it now for my edification and instruction jee crawling hova jem who do you think you are now i mean it scout you antagonize aunty and i ll i ll spank you with that i wa gone you damn morphodite i ll kill you he wa sitting on the bed and it wa easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth he slapped me and i tried another left but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling on the floor it nearly knocked the breath out of me but it didn t matter because i knew he wa fighting he wa fighting me back we were still equal ain t so high and mighty now are you i screamed sailing in again he wa still on the bed and i couldn t get a firm stance so i threw myself at him a hard a i could hitting pulling pinching gouging what had begun a a fist fight became a brawl we were still struggling when atticus separated u that s all he said both of you go to bed right now taah i said at jem he wa being sent to bed at my bedtime who started it asked atticus in resignation jem did he wa tryin to tell me what to do i don t have to mind him now do i atticus smiled let s leave it at this you mind jem whenever he can make you fair enough aunt alexandra wa present but silent and when she went down the hall with atticus we heard her say just one of the thing i ve been telling you about a phrase that united u again ours were adjoining room a i shut the door between them jem said night scout night i murmured picking my way across the room to turn on the light a i passed the bed i stepped on something warm resilient and rather smooth it wa not quite like hard rubber and i had the sensation that it wa alive i also heard it move i switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed whatever i had stepped on wa gone i tapped on jem s door what he said how doe a snake feel sort of rough cold dusty why i think there s one under my bed can you come look are you bein funny jem opened the door he wa in his pajama bottom i noticed not without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckle wa still on his mouth when he saw i meant what i said he said if you think i m gon na put my face down to a snake you ve got another think comin hold on a minute he went to the kitchen and fetched the broom you better get up on the bed he said you reckon it s really one i asked this wa an occasion our house had no cellar they were built on stone block a few foot above the ground and the entry of reptile wa not unknown but wa not commonplace miss rachel haverford s excuse for a glass of neat whiskey every morning wa that she never got over the fright of finding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet on her washing when she went to hang up her negligee jem made a tentative swipe under the bed i looked over the foot to see if a snake would come out none did jem made a deeper swipe do snake grunt it ain t a snake jem said it s somebody suddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed jem raised the broom and missed dill s head by an inch when it appeared god almighty jem s voice wa reverent we watched dill emerge by degree he wa a tight fit he stood up and eased his shoulder turned his foot in their ankle socket rubbed the back of his neck his circulation restored he said hey jem petitioned god again i wa speechless i m bout to perish said dill got anything to eat in a dream i went to the kitchen i brought him back some milk and half a pan of corn bread left over from supper dill devoured it chewing with his front teeth a wa his custom i finally found my voice how d you get here by an involved route refreshed by food dill recited this narrative having been bound in chain and left to die in the basement there were basement in meridian by his new father who disliked him and secretly kept alive on raw field pea by a passing farmer who heard his cry for help the good man poked a bushel pod by pod through the ventilator dill worked himself free by pulling the chain from the wall still in wrist manacle he wandered two mile out of meridian where he discovered a small animal show and wa immediately engaged to wash the camel he traveled with the show all over mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he wa in abbott county alabama just across the river from maycomb he walked the rest of the way how d you get here asked jem he had taken thirteen dollar from his mother s purse caught the nine o clock from meridian and got off at maycomb junction he had walked ten or eleven of the fourteen mile to maycomb off the highway in the scrub bush lest the authority be seeking him and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a cotton wagon he had been under the bed for two hour he thought he had heard u in the diningroom and the clink of fork on plate nearly drove him crazy he thought jem and i would never go to bed he had considered emerging and helping me beat jem a jem had grown far taller but he knew mr finch would break it up soon so he thought it best to stay where he wa he wa worn out dirty beyond belief and home they must not know you re here said jem we d know if they were lookin for you think they re still searchin all the picture show in meridian dill grinned you oughta let your mother know where you are said jem you oughta let her know you re here dill s eye flickered at jem and jem looked at the floor then he rose and broke the remaining code of our childhood he went out of the room and down the hall atticus his voice wa distant can you come here a minute sir beneath it sweat streaked dirt dill s face went white i felt sick atticus wa in the doorway he came to the middle of the room and stood with his hand in his pocket looking down at dill i finally found my voice it s okay dill when he want you to know somethin he tell you dill looked at me i mean it s all right i said you know he wouldn t bother you you know you ain t scared of atticus i m not scared dill muttered just hungry i ll bet atticus s voice had it usual pleasant dryness scout we can do better than a pan of cold corn bread can t we you fill this fellow up and when i get back we ll see what we can see mr finch don t tell aunt rachel don t make me go back please sir i ll run off again whoa son said atticus nobody s about to make you go anywhere but to bed pretty soon i m just going over to tell miss rachel you re here and ask her if you could spend the night with u you d like that wouldn t you and for goodness sake put some of the county back where it belongs the soil erosion s bad enough a it is dill stared at my father s retreating figure he s tryin to be funny i said he mean take a bath see there i told you he wouldn t bother you jem wa standing in a corner of the room looking like the traitor he wa dill i had to tell him he said you can t run three hundred mile off without your mother knowin we left him without a word dill ate and ate and ate he hadn t eaten since last night he used all his money for a ticket boarded the train a he had done many time coolly chatted with the conductor to whom dill wa a familiar sight but he had not the nerve to invoke the rule on small child traveling a distance alone if you ve lost your money the conductor will lend you enough for dinner and your father will pay him back at the end of the line dill made his way through the leftover and wa reaching for a can of pork and bean in the pantry when miss rachel s do oo je sus went off in the hall he shivered like a rabbit he bore with fortitude her wait till i get you home your folk are out of their mind worryin wa quite calm during that s all the harris in you coming out smiled at her reckon you can stay one night and returned the hug at long last bestowed upon him atticus pushed up his glass and rubbed his face your father s tired said aunt alexandra her first word in hour it seemed she had been there but i suppose struck dumb most of the time you child get to bed now we left them in the diningroom atticus still mopping his face from rape to riot to runaway we heard him chuckle i wonder what the next two hour will bring since thing appeared to have worked out pretty well dill and i decided to be civil to jem besides dill had to sleep with him so we might a well speak to him i put on my pajama read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep my eye open dill and jem were quiet when i turned off my reading lamp there wa no strip of light under the door to jem s room i must have slept a long time for when i wa punched awake the room wa dim with the light of the setting moon move over scout he thought he had to i mumbled don t stay mad with him dill got in bed beside me i ain t he said i just wanted to sleep with you are you waked up by this time i wa but lazily so why d you do it no answer i said why d you run off wa he really hateful like you said naw didn t you all build that boat like you wrote you were gon na he just said we would we never did i raised up on my elbow facing dill s outline it s no reason to run off they don t get around to doin what they say they re gon na do half the time that wasn t it he they just wasn t interested in me this wa the weirdest reason for flight i had ever heard how come well they stayed gone all the time and when they were home even they d get off in a room by themselves what d they do in there nothin just sittin and readin but they didn t want me with em i pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up you know something i wa fixin to run off tonight because there they all were you don t want em around you all the time dill dill breathed his patient breath a half sigh good night atticus s gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in the legislature and i don t know what you don t want em around all the time dill you couldn t do anything if they were that s not it a dill explained i found myself wondering what life would be if jem were different even from what he wa now what i would do if atticus did not feel the necessity of my presence help and advice why he couldn t get along a day without me even calpurnia couldn t get along unless i wa there they needed me dill you ain t telling me right your folk couldn t do without you they must be just mean to you tell you what to do about that dill s voice went on steadily in the darkness the thing is what i m tryin to say is they do get on a lot better without me i can t help them any they ain t mean they buy me everything i want but it s now you ve got it go play with it you ve got a roomful of thing i got you that book so go read it dill tried to deepen his voice you re not a boy boy get out and play baseball with other boy they don t hang around the house worryin their folk dill s voice wa his own again oh they ain t mean they kiss you and hug you good night and good mornin and good bye and tell you they love you scout let s get u a baby where there wa a man dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these baby were you could order one that s a lie aunty said god drop em down the chimney at least that s what i think she said for once aunty s diction had not been too clear well that ain t so you get baby from each other but there s this man too he ha all these baby just waitin to wake up he breathes life into em dill wa off again beautiful thing floated around in his dreamy head he could read two book to my one but he preferred the magic of his own invention he could add and subtract faster than lightning but he preferred his own twilight world a world where baby slept waiting to be gathered like morning lily he wa slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown door dill mm why do you reckon boo radley s never run off dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me maybe he doesn t have anywhere to run off to content prev next chapter after many telephone call much pleading on behalf of the defendant and a long forgiving letter from his mother it wa decided that dill could stay we had a week of peace together after that little it seemed a nightmare wa upon u it began one evening after supper dill wa over aunt alexandra wa in her chair in the corner atticus wa in his jem and i were on the floor reading it had been a placid week i had minded aunty jem had outgrown the treehouse but helped dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make boo radley come out at no cost to ourselves place a trail of lemon drop from the back door to the front yard and he d follow it like an ant there wa a knock on the front door jem answered it and said it wa mr heck tate well ask him to come in said atticus i already did there s some men outside in the yard they want you to come out in maycomb grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reason death and politics i wondered who had died jem and i went to the front door but atticus called go back in the house jem turned out the livingroom light and pressed his nose to a window screen aunt alexandra protested just for a second aunty let s see who it is he said dill and i took another window a crowd of men wa standing around atticus they all seemed to be talking at once movin him to the county jail tomorrow mr tate wa saying i don t look for any trouble but i can t guarantee there won t be any don t be foolish heck atticus said this is maycomb said i wa just uneasy heck we ve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure there s nothing to be uneasy about this is saturday atticus said trial ll probably be monday you can keep him one night can t you i don t think anybody in maycomb ll begrudge me a client with time this hard there wa a murmur of glee that died suddenly when mr link dea said nobody around here s up to anything it s that old sarum bunch i m worried about can t you get a what is it heck change of venue said mr tate not much point in that now is it atticus said something inaudible i turned to jem who waved me to silence besides atticus wa saying you re not scared of that crowd are you know how they do when they get shinnied up they don t usually drink on sunday they go to church most of the day atticus said this is a special occasion though someone said they murmured and buzzed until aunty said if jem didn t turn on the livingroom light he would disgrace the family jem didn t hear her don t see why you touched it in the first place mr link dea wa saying you ve got everything to lose from this atticus i mean everything do you really think so this wa atticus s dangerous question do you really think you want to move there scout bam bam bam and the checkerboard wa swept clean of my men do you really think that son then read this jem would struggle the rest of an evening through the speech of henry w grady link that boy might go to the chair but he s not going till the truth s told atticus s voice wa even and you know what the truth is there wa a murmur among the group of men made more ominous when atticus moved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him suddenly jem screamed atticus the telephone s ringing the men jumped a little and scattered they were people we saw every day merchant in town farmer dr reynolds wa there so wa mr avery well answer it son called atticus laughter broke them up when atticus switched on the overhead light in the livingroom he found jem at the window pale except for the vivid mark of the screen on his nose why on earth are you all sitting in the dark he asked jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper i sometimes think atticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind the mobile register the birmingham news and the montgomery advertiser they were after you weren t they jem went to him they wanted to get you didn t they atticus lowered the paper and gazed at jem what have you been reading he asked then he said gently no son those were our friend it wasn t a a gang jem wa looking from the corner of his eye atticus tried to stifle a smile but didn t make it no we don t have mob and that nonsense in maycomb i ve never heard of a gang in maycomb ku klux got after some catholic one time never heard of any catholic in maycomb either said atticus you re confusing that with something else way back about nineteen twenty there wa a klan but it wa a political organization more than anything besides they couldn t find anybody to scare they paraded by mr sam levy s house one night but sam just stood on his porch and told em thing had come to a pretty pas he d sold em the very sheet on their back sam made em so ashamed of themselves they went away the levy family met all criterion for being fine folk they did the best they could with the sense they had and they had been living on the same plot of ground in maycomb for five generation the ku klux s gone said atticus it ll never come back i walked home with dill and returned in time to overhear atticus saying to aunty in favor of southern womanhood a much a anybody but not for preserving polite fiction at the expense of human life a pronouncement that made me suspect they had been fussing again i sought jem and found him in his room on the bed deep in thought have they been at it i asked sort of she won t let him alone about tom robinson she almost said atticus wa disgracin the family scout i m scared scared a what scared about atticus somebody might hurt him jem preferred to remain mysterious all he would say to my question wa go on and leave him alone next day wa sunday in the interval between sunday school and church when the congregation stretched it leg i saw atticus standing in the yard with another knot of men mr heck tate wa present and i wondered if he had seen the light he never went to church even mr underwood wa there mr underwood had no use for any organization but the maycomb tribune of which he wa the sole owner editor and printer his day were spent at his linotype where he refreshed himself occasionally from an ever present gallon jug of cherry wine he rarely gathered news people brought it to him it wa said that he made up every edition of the maycomb tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype this wa believable something must have been up to haul mr underwood out i caught atticus coming in the door and he said that they d moved tom robinson to the maycomb jail he also said more to himself than to me that if they d kept him there in the first place there wouldn t have been any fuss i watched him take his seat on the third row from the front and i heard him rumble nearer my god to thee some note behind the rest of u he never sat with aunty jem and me he liked to be by himself in church the fake peace that prevailed on sunday wa made more irritating by aunt alexandra s presence atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner where if we sometimes looked in on him we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading aunt alexandra composed herself for a two hour nap and dared u to make any noise in the yard the neighborhood wa resting jem in his old age had taken to his room with a stack of football magazine so dill and i spent our sunday creeping around in deer s pasture shooting on sunday wa prohibited so dill and i kicked jem s football around the pasture for a while which wa no fun dill asked if i d like to have a poke at boo radley i said i didn t think it d be nice to bother him and spent the rest of the afternoon filling dill in on last winter s event he wa considerably impressed we parted at suppertime and after our meal jem and i were settling down to a routine evening when atticus did something that interested u he came into the livingroom carrying a long electrical extension cord there wa a light bulb on the end i m going out for a while he said you folk ll be in bed when i come back so i ll say good night now with that he put his hat on and went out the back door he s takin the car said jem our father had a few peculiarity one wa he never ate dessert another wa that he liked to walk a far back a i could remember there wa always a chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse and atticus put many mile on it in business trip but in maycomb he walked to and from his office four time a day covering about two mile he said his only exercise wa walking in maycomb if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind it wa correct to believe one s mind incapable of definite purpose later on i bade my aunt and brother good night and wa well into a book when i heard jem rattling around in his room his go to bed noise were so familiar to me that i knocked on his door why ain t you going to bed i m goin downtown for a while he wa changing his pant why it s almost ten o clock jem he knew it but he wa going anyway then i m goin with you if you say no you re not i m goin anyway hear jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home and i suppose he thought a fight would antagonize aunty so he gave in with little grace i dressed quickly we waited until aunty s light went out and we walked quietly down the back step there wa no moon tonight dill ll wanta come i whispered so he will said jem gloomily we leaped over the driveway wall cut through miss rachel s side yard and went to dill s window jem whistled bob white dill s face appeared at the screen disappeared and five minute later he unhooked the screen and crawled out an old campaigner he did not speak until we were on the sidewalk what s up jem s got the look arounds an affliction calpurnia said all boy caught at his age i ve just got this feeling jem said just this feeling we went by mr dubose s house standing empty and shuttered her camellia grown up in weed and johnson grass there were eight more house to the post office corner the south side of the square wa deserted giant monkey puzzle bush bristled on each corner and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street light a light shone in the county toilet otherwise that side of the courthouse wa dark a larger square of store surrounded the courthouse square dim light burned from deep within them atticus s office wa in the courthouse when he began his law practice but after several year of it he moved to quieter quarter in the maycomb bank building when we rounded the corner of the square we saw the car parked in front of the bank he s in there said jem but he wasn t his office wa reached by a long hallway looking down the hall we should have seen atticus finch attorney at law in small sober letter against the light from behind his door it wa dark jem peered in the bank door to make sure he turned the knob the door wa locked let s go up the street maybe he s visitin mr underwood mr underwood not only ran the maycomb tribune office he lived in it that is above it he covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his upstairs window the office building wa on the northwest corner of the square and to reach it we had to pas the jail the maycomb jail wa the most venerable and hideous of the county s building atticus said it wa like something cousin joshua st clair might have designed it wa certainly someone s dream starkly out of place in a town of square faced store and steep roofed house the maycomb jail wa a miniature gothic joke one cell wide and two cell high complete with tiny battlement and flying buttress it fantasy wa heightened by it red brick facade and the thick steel bar at it ecclesiastical window it stood on no lonely hill but wa wedged between tyndal s hardware store and the maycomb tribune office the jail wa maycomb s only conversation piece it detractor said it looked like a victorian privy it supporter said it gave the town a good solid respectable look and no stranger would ever suspect that it wa full of nigger a we walked up the sidewalk we saw a solitary light burning in the distance that s funny said jem jail doesn t have an outside light look like it s over the door said dill a long extension cord ran between the bar of a second floor window and down the side of the building in the light from it bare bulb atticus wa sitting propped against the front door he wa sitting in one of his office chair and he wa reading oblivious of the nightbugs dancing over his head i made to run but jem caught me don t go to him he said he might not like it he s all right let s go home i just wanted to see where he wa we were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty car came in from the meridian highway moving slowly in a line they went around the square passed the bank building and stopped in front of the jail nobody got out we saw atticus look up from his newspaper he closed it folded it deliberately dropped it in his lap and pushed his hat to the back of his head he seemed to be expecting them come on whispered jem we streaked across the square across the street until we were in the shelter of the jitney jungle door jem peeked up the sidewalk we can get closer he said we ran to tyndal s hardware door near enough at the same time discreet in one and two men got out of the car shadow became substance a light revealed solid shape moving toward the jail door atticus remained where he wa the men hid him from view he in there mr finch a man said he is we heard atticus answer and he s asleep don t wake him up in obedience to my father there followed what i later realized wa a sickeningly comic aspect of an unfunny situation the men talked in near whisper you know what we want another man said get aside from the door mr finch you can turn around and go home again walter atticus said pleasantly heck tate s around somewhere the hell he is said another man heck s bunch s so deep in the wood they won t get out till mornin indeed why so called em off on a snipe hunt wa the succinct answer didn t you think a that mr finch thought about it but didn t believe it well then my father s voice wa still the same that change thing doesn t it it do another deep voice said it owner wa a shadow do you really think so this wa the second time i heard atticus ask that question in two day and it meant somebody s man would get jumped this wa too good to miss i broke away from jem and ran a fast a i could to atticus jem shrieked and tried to catch me but i had a lead on him and dill i pushed my way through dark smelly body and burst into the circle of light h ey atticus i thought he would have a fine surprise but his face killed my joy a flash of plain fear wa going out of his eye but returned when dill and jem wriggled into the light there wa a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about and when i glanced around i discovered that these men were stranger they were not the people i saw last night hot embarrassment shot through me i had leaped triumphantly into a ring of people i had never seen before atticus got up from his chair but he wa moving slowly like an old man he put the newspaper down very carefully adjusting it crease with lingering finger they were trembling a little go home jem he said take scout and dill home we were accustomed to prompt if not always cheerful acquiescence to atticus s instruction but from the way he stood jem wa not thinking of budging go home i said jem shook his head a atticus s fist went to his hip so did jem s and a they faced each other i could see little resemblance between them jem s soft brown hair and eye his oval face and snug fitting ear were our mother s contrasting oddly with atticus s graying black hair and square cut feature but they were somehow alike mutual defiance made them alike son i said go home jem shook his head i ll send him home a burly man said and grabbed jem roughly by the collar he yanked jem nearly off his foot don t you touch him i kicked the man swiftly barefooted i wa surprised to see him fall back in real pain i intended to kick his shin but aimed too high that ll do scout atticus put his hand on my shoulder don t kick folk no he said a i wa pleading justification ain t nobody gon na do jem that way i said all right mr finch get em outa here someone growled you got fifteen second to get em outa here in the midst of this strange assembly atticus stood trying to make jem mind him i ain t going wa his steady answer to atticus s threat request and finally please jem take them home i wa getting a bit tired of that but felt jem had his own reason for doing a he did in view of his prospect once atticus did get him home i looked around the crowd it wa a summer s night but the men were dressed most of them in overall and denim shirt buttoned up to the collar i thought they must be coldnatured a their sleeve were unrolled and buttoned at the cuff some wore hat pulled firmly down over their ear they were sullen looking sleepy eyed men who seemed unused to late hour i sought once more for a familiar face and at the center of the semi circle i found one hey mr cunningham the man did not hear me it seemed hey mr cunningham how s your entailment gettin along mr walter cunningham s legal affair were well known to me atticus had once described them at length the big man blinked and hooked his thumb in his overall strap he seemed uncomfortable he cleared his throat and looked away my friendly overture had fallen flat mr cunningham wore no hat and the top half of his forehead wa white in contrast to his sunscorched face which led me to believe that he wore one most day he shifted his foot clad in heavy work shoe don t you remember me mr cunningham i m jean louise finch you brought u some hickory nut one time remember i began to sense the futility one feel when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance i go to school with walter i began again he s your boy ain t he ain t he sir mr cunningham wa moved to a faint nod he did know me after all he s in my grade i said and he doe right well he s a good boy i added a real nice boy we brought him home for dinner one time maybe he told you about me i beat him up one time but he wa real nice about it tell him hey for me won t you atticus had said it wa the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in not about what you were interested in mr cunningham displayed no interest in his son so i tackled his entailment once more in a last ditch effort to make him feel at home entailment are bad i wa advising him when i slowly awoke to the fact that i wa addressing the entire aggregation the men were all looking at me some had their mouth half open atticus had stopped poking at jem they were standing together beside dill their attention amounted to fascination atticus s mouth even wa half open an attitude he had once described a uncouth our eye met and he shut it well atticus i wa just sayin to mr cunningham that entailment are bad an all that but you said not to worry it take a long time sometimes that you all d ride it out together i wa slowly drying up wondering what idiocy i had committed entailment seemed all right enough for livingroom talk i began to feel sweat gathering at the edge of my hair i could stand anything but a bunch of people looking at me they were quite still what s the matter i asked atticus said nothing i looked around and up at mr cunningham whose face wa equally impassive then he did a peculiar thing he squatted down and took me by both shoulder i ll tell him you said hey little lady he said then he straightened up and waved a big paw let s clear out he called let s get going boy a they had come in one and two the men shuffled back to their ramshackle car door slammed engine coughed and they were gone i turned to atticus but atticus had gone to the jail and wa leaning against it with his face to the wall i went to him and pulled his sleeve can we go home now he nodded produced his handkerchief gave his face a going over and blew his nose violently mr finch a soft husky voice came from the darkness above they gone atticus stepped back and looked up they ve gone he said get some sleep tom they won t bother you any more from a different direction another voice cut crisply through the night you re damn tootin they won t had you covered all the time atticus mr underwood and a double barreled shotgun were leaning out his window above the maycomb tribune office it wa long past my bedtime and i wa growing quite tired it seemed that atticus and mr underwood would talk for the rest of the night mr underwood out the window and atticus up at him finally atticus returned switched off the light above the jail door and picked up his chair can i carry it for you mr finch asked dill he had not said a word the whole time why thank you son walking toward the office dill and i fell into step behind atticus and jem dill wa encumbered by the chair and his pace wa slower atticus and jem were well ahead of u and i assumed that atticus wa giving him hell for not going home but i wa wrong a they passed under a streetlight atticus reached out and massaged jem s hair his one gesture of affection content prev next chapter jem heard me he thrust his head around the connecting door a he came to my bed atticus s light flashed on we stayed where we were until it went off we heard him turn over and we waited until he wa still again jem took me to his room and put me in bed beside him try to go to sleep he said it ll be all over after tomorrow maybe we had come in quietly so a not to wake aunty atticus killed the engine in the driveway and coasted to the carhouse we went in the back door and to our room without a word i wa very tired and wa drifting into sleep when the memory of atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became atticus standing in the middle of an empty waiting street pushing up his glass the full meaning of the night s event hit me and i began cry jem wa awfully nice about it for once he didn t remind me that people nearly nine year old didn t do thing like that everybody s appetite wa delicate this morning except jem s he ate his way through three egg atticus watched in frank admiration aunt alexandra sipped coffee and radiated wave of disapproval child who slipped out at night were a disgrace to the family atticus said he wa right glad his disgrace had come along but aunty said nonsense mr underwood wa there all the time you know it s a funny thing about braxton said atticus he despises negro won t have one near him local opinion held mr underwood to be an intense profane little man whose father in a fey fit of humor christened braxton bragg a name mr underwood had done his best to live down atticus said naming people after confederate general made slow steady drinker calpurnia wa serving aunt alexandra more coffee and she shook her head at what i thought wa a pleading winning look you re still too little she said i ll tell you when you ain t i said it might help my stomach all right she said and got a cup from the sideboard she poured one tablespoonful of coffee into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk i thanked her by sticking out my tongue at it and looked up to catch aunty s warning frown but she wa frowning at atticus she waited until calpurnia wa in the kitchen then she said don t talk like that in front of them talk like what in front of whom he asked like that in front of calpurnia you said braxton underwood despises negro right in front of her well i m sure cal know it everybody in maycomb know it i wa beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these day that came out when he talked with aunt alexandra it wa a quiet digging in never outright irritation there wa a faint starchiness in his voice when he said anything fit to say at the table s fit to say in front of calpurnia she know what she mean to this family i don t think it s a good habit atticus it encourages them you know how they talk among themselves every thing that happens in this town s out to the quarter before sundown my father put down his knife i don t know of any law that say they can t talk maybe if we didn t give them so much to talk about they d be quiet why don t you drink your coffee scout i wa playing in it with the spoon i thought mr cunningham wa a friend of ours you told me a long time ago he wa he still is but last night he wanted to hurt you atticus placed his fork beside his knife and pushed his plate aside mr cunningham s basically a good man he said he just ha his blind spot along with the rest of u jem spoke don t call that a blind spot he da killed you last night when he first went there he might have hurt me a little atticus conceded but son you ll understand folk a little better when you re older a mob s always made up of people no matter what mr cunningham wa part of a mob last night but he wa still a man every mob in every little southern town is always made up of people you know doesn t say much for them doe it i ll say not said jem so it took an eight year old child to bring em to their sens didn t it said atticus that prof something that a gang of wild animal can be stopped simply because they re still human hmp maybe we need a police force of child you child last night made walter cunningham stand in my shoe for a minute that wa enough well i hoped jem would understand folk a little better when he wa older i wouldn t first day walter come back to school ll be his last i affirmed you will not touch him atticus said flatly i don t want either of you bearing a grudge about this thing no matter what happens you see don t you said aunt alexandra what come of thing like this don t say i haven t told you atticus said he d never say that pushed out his chair and got up there s a day ahead so excuse me jem i don t want you and scout downtown today please a atticus departed dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom it s all over town this morning he announced all about how we held off a hundred folk with our bare hand aunt alexandra stared him to silence it wa not a hundred folk she said and nobody held anybody off it wa just a nest of those cunningham drunk and disorderly aw aunty that s just dill s way said jem he signaled u to follow him you all stay in the yard today she said a we made our way to the front porch it wa like saturday people from the south end of the county passed our house in a leisurely but steady stream mr dolphus raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred don t see how he stay in the saddle murmured jem how c n you stand to get drunk fore eight in the morning a wagonload of lady rattled past u they wore cotton sunbonnet and dress with long sleeve a bearded man in a wool hat drove them yonder s some mennonite jem said to dill they don t have button they lived deep in the wood did most of their trading across the river and rarely came to maycomb dill wa interested they ve all got blue eye jem explained and the men can t shave after they marry their wife like for em to tickle em with their beard mr x billups rode by on a mule and waved to u he s a funny man said jem x s his name not his initial he wa in court one time and they asked him his name he said x billups clerk asked him to spell it and he said x asked him again and he said x they kept at it till he wrote x on a sheet of paper and held it up for everybody to see they asked him where he got his name and he said that s the way his folk signed him up when he wa born a the county went by u jem gave dill the history and general attitude of the more prominent figure mr tensaw jones voted the straight prohibition ticket miss emily davis dipped snuff in private mr byron waller could play the violin mr jake slade wa cutting his third set of teeth a wagonload of unusually stern faced citizen appeared when they pointed to miss maudie atkinson s yard ablaze with summer flower miss maudie herself came out on the porch there wa an odd thing about miss maudie on her porch she wa too far away for u to see her feature clearly but we could always catch her mood by the way she stood she wa now standing arm akimbo her shoulder drooping a little her head cocked to one side her glass winking in the sunlight we knew she wore a grin of the uttermost wickedness the driver of the wagon slowed down his mule and a shrill voiced woman called out he that cometh in vanity departeth in darkness miss maudie answered a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance i guess that the foot washer thought that the devil wa quoting scripture for his own purpose a the driver speeded his mule why they objected to miss maudie s yard wa a mystery heightened in my mind because for someone who spent all the daylight hour outdoors miss maudie s command of scripture wa formidable you goin to court this morning asked jem we had strolled over i am not she said i have no business with the court this morning aren t you goin down to watch asked dill i am not t s morbid watching a poor devil on trial for his life look at all those folk it s like a roman carnival they hafta try him in public miss maudie i said wouldn t be right if they didn t i m quite aware of that she said just because it s public i don t have to go do i miss stephanie crawford came by she wore a hat and glove um um um she said look at all those folk you d think william jennings bryan wa speakin and where are you going stephanie inquired miss maudie to the jitney jungle miss maudie said she d never seen miss stephanie go to the jitney jungle in a hat in her life well said miss stephanie i thought i might just look in at the courthouse to see what atticus s up to better be careful he doesn t hand you a subpoena we asked miss maudie to elucidate she said miss stephanie seemed to know so much about the case she might a well be called on to testify we held off until noon when atticus came home to dinner and said they d spent the morning picking the jury after dinner we stopped by for dill and went to town it wa a gala occasion there wa no room at the public hitching rail for another animal mule and wagon were parked under every available tree the courthouse square wa covered with picnic party sitting on newspaper washing down biscuit and syrup with warm milk from fruit jar some people were gnawing on cold chicken and cold fried pork chop the more affluent chased their food with drugstore coca cola in bulb shaped soda glass greasy faced child popped the whip through the crowd and baby lunched at their mother breast in a far corner of the square the negro sat quietly in the sun dining on sardine cracker and the more vivid flavor of nehi cola mr dolphus raymond sat with them jem said dill he s drinkin out of a sack mr dolphus raymond seemed to be so doing two yellow drugstore straw ran from his mouth to the depth of a brown paper bag ain t ever seen anybody do that murmured dill how doe he keep what s in it in it jem giggled he s got a co cola bottle full of whiskey in there that s so s not to upset the lady you ll see him sip it all afternoon he ll step out for a while and fill it back up why s he sittin with the colored folk always doe he like em better n he like u i reckon life by himself way down near the county line he s got a colored woman and all sort of mixed chillun show you some of em if we see em he doesn t look like trash said dill he s not he owns all one side of the riverbank down there and he s from a real old family to boot then why doe he do like that that s just his way said jem they say he never got over his weddin he wa supposed to marry one of the the spencer lady i think they were gon na have a huge weddin but they didn t after the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and blew her head off shotgun she pulled the trigger with her toe did they ever know why no said jem nobody ever knew quite why but mr dolphus they said it wa because she found out about his colored woman he reckoned he could keep her and get married too he s been sorta drunk ever since you know though he s real good to those chillun jem i asked what s a mixed child half white half colored you ve seen em scout you know that red kinkyheaded one that delivers for the drugstore he s half white they re real sad sad how come they don t belong anywhere colored folk won t have em because they re half white white folk won t have em cause they re colored so they re just inbetweens don t belong anywhere but mr dolphus now they say he s shipped two of his up north they don t mind em up north yonder s one of em a small boy clutching a negro woman s hand walked toward u he looked all negro to me he wa rich chocolate with flaring nostril and beautiful teeth sometimes he would skip happily and the negro woman tugged his hand to make him stop jem waited until they passed u that s one of the little one he said how can you tell asked dill he looked black to me you can t sometimes not unless you know who they are but he s half raymond all right but how can you tell i asked i told you scout you just hafta know who they are well how do you know we ain t negro uncle jack finch say we really don t know he say a far a he can trace back the finch we ain t but for all he know we mighta come straight out of ethiopia durin the old testament well if we came out durin the old testament it s too long ago to matter that s what i thought said jem but around here once you have a drop of negro blood that make you all black hey look some invisible signal had made the luncher on the square rise and scatter bit of newspaper cellophane and wrapping paper child came to mother baby were cradled on hip a men in sweat stained hat collected their family and herded them through the courthouse door in the far corner of the square the negro and mr dolphus raymond stood up and dusted their breech there were few woman and child among them which seemed to dispel the holiday mood they waited patiently at the door behind the white family let s go in said dill naw we better wait till they get in atticus might not like it if he see u said jem the maycomb county courthouse wa faintly reminiscent of arlington in one respect the concrete pillar supporting it south roof were too heavy for their light burden the pillar were all that remained standing when the original courthouse burned in another courthouse wa built around them it is better to say built in spite of them but for the south porch the maycomb county courthouse wa early victorian presenting an unoffensive vista when seen from the north from the other side however greek revival column clashed with a big nineteenth century clock tower housing a rusty unreliable instrument a view indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap of the past to reach the courtroom on the second floor one passed sundry sunless county cubbyhole the tax assessor the tax collector the county clerk the county solicitor the circuit clerk the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutch that smelled of decaying record book mingled with old damp cement and stale urine it wa necessary to turn on the light in the daytime there wa always a film of dust on the rough floorboard the inhabitant of these office were creature of their environment little gray faced men they seemed untouched by wind or sun we knew there wa a crowd but we had not bargained for the multitude in the first floor hallway i got separated from jem and dill but made my way toward the wall by the stairwell knowing jem would come for me eventually i found myself in the middle of the idler club and made myself a unobtrusive a possible this wa a group of white shirted khaki trousered suspendered old men who had spent their life doing nothing and passed their twilight day doing same on pine bench under the live oak on the square attentive critic of courthouse business atticus said they knew a much law a the chief justice from long year of observation normally they were the court s only spectator and today they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortable routine when they spoke their voice sounded casually important the conversation wa about my father think he know what he s doing one said oh h now i wouldn t say that said another atticus finch s a deep reader a mighty deep reader he read all right that s all he doe the club snickered lem me tell you somethin now billy a third said you know the court appointed him to defend this nigger yeah but atticus aim to defend him that s what i don t like about it this wa news news that put a different light on thing atticus had to whether he wanted to or not i thought it odd that he hadn t said anything to u about it we could have used it many time in defending him and ourselves he had to that s why he wa doing it equaled fewer fight and less fussing but did that explain the town s attitude the court appointed atticus to defend him atticus aimed to defend him that s what they didn t like about it it wa confusing the negro having waited for the white people to go upstairs began to come in whoa now just a minute said a club member holding up his walking stick just don t start up them there stair yet awhile the club began it stiff jointed climb and ran into dill and jem on their way down looking for me they squeezed past and jem called scout come on there ain t a seat left we ll hafta stand up looka there now he said irritably a the black people surged upstairs the old men ahead of them would take most of the standing room we were out of luck and it wa my fault jem informed me we stood miserably by the wall can t you all get in reverend sykes wa looking down at u black hat in hand hey reverend said jem naw scout here messed u up well let s see what we can do reverend sykes edged his way upstairs in a few moment he wa back there s not a seat downstairs do you all reckon it ll be all right if you all came to the balcony with me gosh yes said jem happily we sped ahead of reverend sykes to the courtroom floor there we went up a covered staircase and waited at the door reverend sykes came puffing behind u and steered u gently through the black people in the balcony four negro rose and gave u their front row seat the colored balcony ran along three wall of the courtroom like a second story veranda and from it we could see everything the jury sat to the left under long window sunburned lanky they seemed to be all farmer but this wa natural townfolk rarely sat on jury they were either struck or excused one or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressed up cunningham at this stage they sat straight and alert the circuit solicitor and another man atticus and tom robinson sat at table with their back to u there wa a brown book and some yellow tablet on the solicitor s table atticus s wa bare just inside the railing that divided the spectator from the court the witness sat on cowhide bottomed chair their back were to u judge taylor wa on the bench looking like a sleepy old shark his pilot fish writing rapidly below in front of him judge taylor looked like most judge i had ever seen amiable white haired slightly ruddy faced he wa a man who ran his court with an alarming informality he sometimes propped his foot up he often cleaned his fingernail with his pocket knife in long equity hearing especially after dinner he gave the impression of dozing an impression dispelled forever when a lawyer once deliberately pushed a pile of book to the floor in a desperate effort to wake him up without opening his eye judge taylor murmured mr whitley do that again and it ll cost you one hundred dollar he wa a man learned in the law and although he seemed to take his job casually in reality he kept a firm grip on any proceeding that came before him only once wa judge taylor ever seen at a dead standstill in open court and the cunningham stopped him old sarum their stamping ground wa populated by two family separate and apart in the beginning but unfortunately bearing the same name the cunningham married the coninghams until the spelling of the name wa academic academic until a cunningham disputed a coningham over land title and took to the law during a controversy of this character jeems cunningham testified that his mother spelled it cunningham on deed and thing but she wa really a coningham she wa an uncertain speller a seldom reader and wa given to looking far away sometimes when she sat on the front gallery in the evening after nine hour of listening to the eccentricity of old sarum s inhabitant judge taylor threw the case out of court when asked upon what ground judge taylor said champertous connivance and declared he hoped to god the litigant were satisfied by each having had their public say they were that wa all they had wanted in the first place judge taylor had one interesting habit he permitted smoking in his courtroom but did not himself indulge sometimes if one wa lucky one had the privilege of watching him put a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up bit by bit the dead cigar would disappear to reappear some hour later a a flat slick mess it essence extracted and mingling with judge taylor s digestive juice i once asked atticus how mr taylor stood to kiss him but atticus said they didn t kiss much the witness stand wa to the right of judge taylor and when we got to our seat mr heck tate wa already on it content prev next chapter jem i said are those the ewells sittin down yonder hush said jem mr heck tate s testifyin mr tate had dressed for the occasion he wore an ordinary business suit which made him look somehow like every other man gone were his high boot lumber jacket and bullet studded belt from that moment he ceased to terrify me he wa sitting forward in the witness chair his hand clasped between his knee listening attentively to the circuit solicitor the solicitor a mr gilmer wa not well known to u he wa from abbottsville we saw him only when court convened and that rarely for court wa of no special interest to jem and me a balding smooth faced man he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty although his back wa to u we knew he had a slight cast in one of his eye which he used to his advantage he seemed to be looking at a person when he wa actually doing nothing of the kind thus he wa hell on jury and witness the jury thinking themselves under close scrutiny paid attention so did the witness thinking likewise in your own word mr tate mr gilmer wa saying well said mr tate touching his glass and speaking to his knee i wa called could you say it to the jury mr tate thank you who called you mr tate said i wa fetched by bob by mr bob ewell yonder one night what night sir mr tate said it wa the night of november twenty first i wa just leaving my office to go home when b mr ewell came in very excited he wa and said get out to his house quick some nigger d raped his girl did you go certainly got in the car and went out a fast a i could and what did you find found her lying on the floor in the middle of the front room one on the right a you go in she wa pretty well beat up but i heaved her to her foot and she washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she wa all right i asked her who hurt her and she said it wa tom robinson judge taylor who had been concentrating on his fingernail looked up a if he were expecting an objection but atticus wa quiet asked her if he beat her like that she said yes he had asked her if he took advantage of her and she said yes he did so i went down to robinson s house and brought him back she identified him a the one so i took him in that s all there wa to it thank you said mr gilmer judge taylor said any question atticus yes said my father he wa sitting behind his table his chair wa skewed to one side his leg were crossed and one arm wa resting on the back of his chair did you call a doctor sheriff did anybody call a doctor asked atticus no sir said mr tate didn t call a doctor no sir repeated mr tate why not there wa an edge to atticus s voice well i can tell you why i didn t it wasn t necessary mr finch she wa mighty banged up something sho happened it wa obvious but you didn t call a doctor while you were there did anyone send for one fetch one carry her to one no sir judge taylor broke in he s answered the question three time atticus he didn t call a doctor atticus said i just wanted to make sure judge and the judge smiled jem s hand which wa resting on the balcony rail tightened around it he drew in his breath suddenly glancing below i saw no corresponding reaction and wondered if jem wa trying to be dramatic dill wa watching peacefully and so wa reverend sykes beside him what is it i whispered and got a terse sh h sheriff atticus wa saying you say she wa mighty banged up in what way well just describe her injury heck well she wa beaten around the head there wa already bruise comin on her arm and it happened about thirty minute before how do you know mr tate grinned sorry that s what they said anyway she wa pretty bruised up when i got there and she had a black eye comin which eye mr tate blinked and ran his hand through his hair let s see he said softly then he looked at atticus a if he considered the question childish can t you remember atticus asked mr tate pointed to an invisible person five inch in front of him and said her left wait a minute sheriff said atticus wa it her left facing you or her left looking the same way you were mr tate said oh yes that d make it her right it wa her right eye mr finch i remember now she wa bunged up on that side of her face mr tate blinked again a if something had suddenly been made plain to him then he turned his head and looked around at tom robinson a if by instinct tom robinson raised his head something had been made plain to atticus also and it brought him to his foot sheriff please repeat what you said it wa her right eye i said no atticus walked to the court reporter s desk and bent down to the furiously scribbling hand it stopped flipped back the shorthand pad and the court reporter said mr finch i remember now she wa bunged up on that side of the face atticus looked up at mr tate which side again heck the right side mr finch but she had more bruise you wanta hear about em atticus seemed to be bordering on another question but he thought better of it and said yes what were her other injury a mr tate answered atticus turned and looked at tom robinson a if to say this wa something they hadn t bargained for her arm were bruised and she showed me her neck there were definite finger mark on her gullet all around her throat at the back of her neck i d say they were all around mr finch you would yes sir she had a small throat anybody could a reached around it with just answer the question yes or no please sheriff said atticus dryly and mr tate fell silent atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor who shook his head at the judge who nodded to mr tate who rose stiffly and stepped down from the witness stand below u head turned foot scraped the floor baby were shifted to shoulder and a few child scampered out of the courtroom the negro behind u whispered softly among themselves dill wa asking reverend sykes what it wa all about but reverend sykes said he didn t know so far thing were utterly dull nobody had thundered there were no argument between opposing counsel there wa no drama a grave disappointment to all present it seemed atticus wa proceeding amiably a if he were involved in a title dispute with his infinite capacity for calming turbulent sea he could make a rape case a dry a a sermon gone wa the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smell of sleepyeyed sullen men of a husky voice calling in the night mr finch they gone our nightmare had gone with daylight everything would come out all right all the spectator were a relaxed a judge taylor except jem his mouth wa twisted into a purposeful half grin and his eye happy about and he said something about corroborating evidence which made me sure he wa showing off robert e lee ewell in answer to the clerk s booming voice a little bantam cock of a man rose and strutted to the stand the back of his neck reddening at the sound of his name when he turned around to take the oath we saw that his face wa a red a his neck we also saw no resemblance to his namesake a shock of wispy newwashed hair stood up from his forehead his nose wa thin pointed and shiny he had no chin to speak of it seemed to be part of his crepey neck so help me god he crowed every town the size of maycomb had family like the ewells no economic fluctuation changed their status people like the ewells lived a guest of the county in prosperity a well a in the depth of a depression no truant officer could keep their numerous offspring in school no public health officer could free them from congenital defect various worm and the disease indigenous to filthy surroundings maycomb s ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what wa once a negro cabin the cabin s plank wall were supplemented with sheet of corrugated iron it roof shingled with tin can hammered flat so only it general shape suggested it original design square with four tiny room opening onto a shotgun hall the cabin rested uneasily upon four irregular lump of limestone it window were merely open space in the wall which in the summertime were covered with greasy strip of cheesecloth to keep out the varmint that feasted on maycomb s refuse the varmint had a lean time of it for the ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning every day and the fruit of their industry those that were not eaten made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child what passed for a fence wa bit of tree limb broomstick and tool shaft all tipped with rusty hammer head snaggle toothed rake head shovel ax and grubbing hoe held on with piece of barbed wire enclosed by this barricade wa a dirty yard containing the remains of a model t ford on block a discarded dentist s chair an ancient icebox plus lesser item old shoe worn out table radio picture frame and fruit jar under which scrawny orange chicken pecked hopefully one corner of the yard though bewildered maycomb against the fence in a line were six chipped enamel slop jar holding brilliant red geranium cared for a tenderly a if they belonged to miss maudie atkinson had miss maudie deigned to permit a geranium on her premise people said they were mayella ewell s nobody wa quite sure how many child were on the place some people said six others said nine there were always several dirty faced one at the window when anyone passed by nobody had occasion to pas by except at christmas when the church delivered basket and when the mayor of maycomb asked u to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own tree and trash atticus took u with him last christmas when he complied with the mayor s request a dirt road ran from the highway past the dump down to a small negro settlement some five hundred yard beyond the ewells it wa necessary either to back out to the highway or go the full length of the road and turn around most people turned around in the negro front yard in the frosty december dusk their cabin looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimney and doorway glowing amber from the fire inside there were delicious smell about chicken bacon frying crisp a the twilight air jem and i detected squirrel cooking but it took an old countryman like atticus to identify possum and rabbit aroma that vanished when we rode back past the ewell residence all the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his nearest neighbor wa that if scrubbed with lye soap in very hot water his skin wa white mr robert ewell asked mr gilmer that s m name cap n said the witness mr gilmer s back stiffened a little and i felt sorry for him perhaps i d better explain something now i ve heard that lawyer child on seeing their parent in court in the heat of argument get the wrong idea they think opposing counsel to be the personal enemy of their parent they suffer agony and are surprised to see them often go out arm in arm with their tormenter during the first recess this wa not true of jem and me we acquired no trauma from watching our father win or lose i m sorry that i can t provide any drama in this respect if i did it would not be true we could tell however when debate became more acrimonious than professional but this wa from watching lawyer other than our father i never heard atticus raise his voice in my life except to a deaf witness mr gilmer wa doing his job a atticus wa doing his besides mr ewell wa mr gilmer s witness and he had no business being rude to him of all people are you the father of mayella ewell wa the next question well if i ain t i can t do nothing about it now her ma s dead wa the answer judge taylor stirred he turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at the witness are you the father of mayella ewell he asked in a way that made the laughter below u stop suddenly yes sir mr ewell said meekly judge taylor went on in tone of good will this the first time you ve ever been in court i don t recall ever seeing you here at the witness s affirmative nod he continued well let s get something straight there will be no more audibly obscene speculation on any subject from anybody in this courtroom a long a i m sitting here do you understand mr ewell nodded but i don t think he did judge taylor sighed and said all right mr gilmer thank you sir mr ewell would you tell u in your own word what happened on the evening of november twenty first please jem grinned and pushed his hair back just in your own word wa mr gilmer s trademark we often wondered who else s word mr gilmer wa afraid his witness might employ well the night of november twenty one i wa comin in from the wood with a load o kindlin and just a i got to the fence i heard mayella screamin like a stuck hog inside the house here judge taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have decided his speculation devoid of evil intent for he subsided sleepily what time wa it mr ewell just fore sundown well i wa sayin mayella wa screamin fit to beat jesus another glance from the bench silenced mr ewell yes she wa screaming said mr gilmer mr ewell looked confusedly at the judge well mayella wa raisin this holy racket so i dropped m load and run a fast a i could but i run into th fence but when i got distangled i run up to th window and i seen mr ewell s face grew scarlet he stood up and pointed his finger at tom robinson i seen that black nigger yonder ruttin on my mayella so serene wa judge taylor s court that he had few occasion to use his gavel but he hammered fully five minute atticus wa on his foot at the bench saying something to him mr heck tate a first officer of the county stood in the middle aisle quelling the packed courtroom behind u there wa an angry muffled groan from the colored people reverend sykes leaned across dill and me pulling at jem s elbow mr jem he said you better take miss jean louise home mr jem you hear me jem turned his head scout go home dill you n scout go home you got ta make me first i said remembering atticus s blessed dictum jem scowled furiously at me then said to reverend sykes i think it s okay reverend she doesn t understand it i wa mortally offended i most certainly do i c n understand anything you can aw hush she doesn t understand it reverend she ain t nine yet reverend sykes s black eye were anxious mr finch know you all are here this ain t fit for miss jean louise or you boy either jem shook his head he can t see u this far away it s all right reverend i knew jem would win because i knew nothing could make him leave now dill and i were safe for a while atticus could see u from where he wa if he looked a judge taylor banged his gavel mr ewell wa sitting smugly in the witness chair surveying his handiwork with one phrase he had turned happy picknicker into a sulky tense murmuring crowd being slowly hypnotized by gavel tap lessening in intensity until the only sound in the courtroom wa a dim pink pinkpink the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil in possession of his court once more judge taylor leaned back in his chair he looked suddenly weary his age wa showing and i thought about what atticus had said he and mr taylor didn t kiss much he must have been nearly seventy there ha been a request judge taylor said that this courtroom be cleared of spectator or at least of woman and child a request that will be denied for the time being people generally see what they look for and hear what they listen for and they have the right to subject their child to it but i can assure you of one thing you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this courtroom but you won t leave it until the whole boiling of you come before me on contempt charge mr ewell you will keep your testimony within the confines of christian english usage if that is possible proceed mr gilmer mr ewell reminded me of a deaf mute i wa sure he had never heard the word judge taylor directed at him his mouth struggled silently with them but their import registered on his face smugness faded from it replaced by a dogged earnestness that fooled judge taylor not at all a long a mr ewell wa on the stand the judge kept his eye on him a if daring him to make a false move mr gilmer and atticus exchanged glance atticus wa sitting down again his fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face mr gilmer looked rather desperate a question from judge taylor made him relax mr ewell did you see the defendant having sexual intercourse with your daughter yes i did the spectator were quiet but the defendant said something atticus whispered to him and tom robinson wa silent you say you were at the window asked mr gilmer yes sir how far is it from the ground bout three foot did you have a clear view of the room yes sir how did the room look well it wa all slung about like there wa a fight what did you do when you saw the defendant well i run around the house to get in but he run out the front door just ahead of me i sawed who he wa all right i wa too distracted about mayella to run after im i run in the house and she wa lyin on the floor squallin then what did you do why i run for tate quick a i could i knowed who it wa all right lived down yonder in that nigger nest passed the house every day jedge i ve asked this county for fifteen year to clean out that nest down yonder they re dangerous to live around side devaluin my property thank you mr ewell said mr gilmer hurriedly the witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into atticus who had risen to question him judge taylor permitted the court to laugh just a minute sir said atticus genially could i ask you a question or two mr ewell backed up into the witness chair settled himself and regarded atticus with haughty suspicion an expression common to maycomb county witness when confronted by opposing counsel mr ewell atticus began folk were doing a lot of running that night let s see you say you ran to the house you ran to the window you ran inside you ran to mayella you ran for mr tate did you during all this running run for a doctor wadn t no need to i seen what happened but there s one thing i don t understand said atticus weren t you concerned with mayella s condition i most positively wa said mr ewell i seen who done it no i mean her physical condition did you not think the nature of her injury warranted immediate medical attention what didn t you think she should have had a doctor immediately the witness said he never thought of it he had never called a doctor to any of his n in his life and if he had it would have cost him five dollar that all he asked not quite said atticus casually mr ewell you heard the sheriff s testimony didn t you how s that you were in the courtroom when mr heck tate wa on the stand weren t you you heard everything he said didn t you mr ewell considered the matter carefully and seemed to decide that the question wa safe yes he said do you agree with his description of mayella s injury how s that atticus looked around at mr gilmer and smiled mr ewell seemed determined not to give the defense the time of day mr tate testified that her right eye wa blackened that she wa beaten around the oh yeah said the witness i hold with everything tate said you do asked atticus mildly i just want to make sure he went to the court reporter said something and the reporter entertained u for some minute by reading mr tate s testimony a if it were stock market quotation which eye her left oh yes that d make it her right it wa her right eye mr finch i remember now she wa bunged he flipped the page up on that side of the face sheriff please repeat what you said it wa her right eye i said thank you bert said atticus you heard it again mr ewell do you have anything to add to it do you agree with the sheriff i hold with tate her eye wa blacked and she wa mighty beat up the little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench it wa becoming evident that he thought atticus an easy match he seemed to grow ruddy again his chest swelled and once more he wa a red little rooster i thought he d burst his shirt at atticus s next question mr ewell can you read and write mr gilmer interrupted objection he said can t see what witness s literacy ha to do with the case irrelevant n immaterial judge taylor wa about to speak but atticus said judge if you ll allow the question plus another one you ll soon see all right let s see said judge taylor but make sure we see atticus overruled mr gilmer seemed a curious a the rest of u a to what bearing the state of mr ewell s education had on the case i ll repeat the question said atticus can you read and write i most positively can will you write your name and show u i most positively will how do you think i sign my relief check mr ewell wa endearing himself to his fellow citizen the whisper and chuckle below u probably had to do with what a card he wa i wa becoming nervous atticus seemed to know what he wa doing but it seemed to me that he d gone frog sticking without a light never never never on cross examination ask a witness a question you don t already know the answer to wa a tenet i absorbed with my baby food do it and you ll often get an answer you don t want an answer that might wreck your case atticus wa reaching into the inside pocket of his coat he drew out an envelope then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen he moved leisurely and had turned so that he wa in full view of the jury he unscrewed the fountain pen cap and placed it gently on his table he shook the pen a little then handed it with the envelope to the witness would you write your name for u he asked clearly now so the jury can see you do it mr ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up complacently to see judge taylor staring at him a if he were some fragrant gardenia in full bloom on the witness stand to see mr gilmer half sitting half standing at his table the jury wa watching him one man wa leaning forward with his hand over the railing what s so interestin he asked you re left handed mr ewell said judge taylor mr ewell turned angrily to the judge and said he didn t see what his being left handed had to do with it that he wa a christ fearing man and atticus finch wa taking advantage of him tricking lawyer like atticus finch took advantage of him all the time with their tricking way he had told them what happened he d say it again and again which he did nothing atticus asked him after that shook his story that he d looked through the window then ran the nigger off then ran for the sheriff atticus finally dismissed him mr gilmer asked him one more question about your writing with your left hand are you ambidextrous mr ewell i most positively am not i can use one hand good a the other one hand good a the other he added glaring at the defense table jem seemed to be having a quiet fit he wa pounding the balcony rail softly and once he whispered we ve got him i didn t think so atticus wa trying to show it seemed to me that mr ewell could have beaten up mayella that much i could follow if her right eye wa blacked and she wa beaten mostly on the right side of the face it would tend to show that a left handed person did it sherlock holmes and jem finch would agree but tom robinson could easily be left handed too like mr heck tate i imagined a person facing me went through a swift mental pantomime and concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with his left i looked down at him his back wa to u but i could see his broad shoulder and bull thick neck he could easily have done it i thought jem wa counting his chicken content prev next chapter but someone wa booming again mayella violet ewell a young girl walked to the witness stand a she raised her hand and swore that the evidence she gave would be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help her god she seemed somehow fragile looking but when she sat facing u in the witness chair she became what she wa a thick bodied girl accustomed to strenuous labor in maycomb county it wa easy to tell when someone bathed regularly a opposed to yearly lavation mr ewell had a scalded look a if an overnight soaking had deprived him of protective layer of dirt his skin appeared to be sensitive to the element mayella looked a if she tried to keep clean and i wa reminded of the row of red geranium in the ewell yard mr gilmer asked mayella to tell the jury in her own word what happened on the evening of november twenty first of last year just in her own word please mayella sat silently where were you at dusk on that evening began mr gilmer patiently on the porch which porch ain t but one the front porch what were you doing on the porch nothin judge taylor said just tell u what happened you can do that can t you mayella stared at him and burst into tear she covered her mouth with her hand and sobbed judge taylor let her cry for a while then he said that s enough now don t be fraid of anybody here a long a you tell the truth all this is strange to you i know but you ve nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear what are you scared of mayella said something behind her hand what wa that asked the judge him she sobbed pointing at atticus mr finch she nodded vigorously saying don t want him doin me like he done papa tryin to make him out lefthanded judge taylor scratched his thick white hair it wa plain that he had never been confronted with a problem of this kind how old are you he asked nineteen and a half mayella said judge taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing tone mr finch ha no idea of scaring you he growled and if he did i m here to stop him that s one thing i m sitting up here for now you re a big girl so you just sit up straight and tell the tell u what happened to you you can do that can t you i whispered to jem ha she got good sense jem wa squinting down at the witness stand can t tell yet he said she s got enough sense to get the judge sorry for her but she might be just oh i don t know mollified mayella gave atticus a final terrified glance and said to mr gilmer well sir i wa on the porch and and he came along and you see there wa this old chiffarobe in the yard papa d brought in to chop up for kindlin papa told me to do it while he wa off in the wood but i wadn t feelin strong enough then so he came by who is he mayella pointed to tom robinson i ll have to ask you to be more specific please said mr gilmer the reporter can t put down gesture very well that n yonder she said robinson then what happened i said come here nigger and bust up this chiffarobe for me i got ta nickel for you he coulda done it easy enough he could so he come in the yard an i went in the house to get him the nickel and i turned around an fore i knew it he wa on me just run up behind me he did he got me round the neck cussin me an sayin dirt i fought n hollered but he had me round the neck he hit me agin an agin mr gilmer waited for mayella to collect herself she had twisted her handkerchief into a sweaty rope when she opened it to wipe her face it wa a mass of crease from her hot hand she waited for mr gilmer to ask another question but when he didn t she said he chunked me on the floor an choked me n took advantage of me did you scream asked mr gilmer did you scream and fight back reckon i did hollered for all i wa worth kicked and hollered loud a i could then what happened i don t remember too good but next thing i knew papa wa in the room a standing over me hollerin who done it who done it then i sorta fainted an the next thing i knew mr tate wa pullin me up offa the floor and leadin me to the water bucket apparently mayella s recital had given her confidence but it wa not her father s brash kind there wa something stealthy about hers like a steady eyed cat with a twitchy tail you say you fought him off a hard a you could fought him tooth and nail asked mr gilmer i positively did mayella echoed her father you are positive that he took full advantage of you mayella s face contorted and i wa afraid that she would cry again instead she said he done what he wa after mr gilmer called attention to the hot day by wiping his head with his hand that s all for the time being he said pleasantly but you stay there i expect big bad mr finch ha some question to ask you state will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defense murmured judge taylor primly at least not at this time atticus got up grinning but instead of walking to the witness stand he opened his coat and hooked his thumb in his vest then he walked slowly across the room to the window he looked out but didn t seem especially interested in what he saw then he turned and strolled back to the witness stand from long year of experience i could tell he wa trying to come to a decision about something miss mayella he said smiling i won t try to scare you for a while not yet let s just get acquainted how old are you said i wa nineteen said it to the judge yonder mayella jerked her head resentfully at the bench so you did so you did ma am you ll have to bear with me miss mayella i m getting along and can t remember a well a i used to i might ask you thing you ve already said before but you ll give me an answer won t you good i could see nothing in mayella s expression to justify atticus s assumption that he had secured her wholehearted cooperation she wa looking at him furiously won t answer a word you say long a you keep on mockin me she said ma am asked atticus startled long s you keep on makin fun o me judge taylor said mr finch is not making fun of you what s the matter with you mayella looked from under lowered eyelid at atticus but she said to the judge long s he keep on callin me ma am an sayin miss mayella i don t hafta take his sas i ain t called upon to take it atticus resumed his stroll to the window and let judge taylor handle this one judge taylor wa not the kind of figure that ever evoked pity but i did feel a pang for him a he tried to explain that s just mr finch s way he told mayella we ve done business in this court for year and year and mr finch is always courteous to everybody he s not trying to mock you he s trying to be polite that s just his way the judge leaned back atticus let s get on with these proceeding and let the record show that the witness ha not been sassed her view to the contrary i wondered if anybody had ever called her ma am or miss mayella in her life probably not a she took offense to routine courtesy what on earth wa her life like i soon found out you say you re nineteen atticus resumed how many sister and brother have you he walked from the window back to the stand seb m she said and i wondered if they were all like the specimen i had seen the first day i started to school you the eldest the oldest yes how long ha your mother been dead don t know long time did you ever go to school read n write good a papa yonder mayella sounded like a mr jingle in a book i had been reading how long did you go to school two year three year dunno slowly but surely i began to see the pattern of atticus s question from question that mr gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to atticus wa quietly building up before the jury a picture of the ewells home life the jury learned the following thing their relief check wa far from enough to feed the family and there wa strong suspicion that papa drank it up anyway he sometimes went off in the swamp for day and came home sick the weather wa seldom cold enough to require shoe but when it wa you could make dandy one from strip of old tire the family hauled it water in bucket from a spring that ran out at one end of the dump they kept the surrounding area clear of trash and it wa everybody for himself a far a keeping clean went if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water the younger child had perpetual cold and suffered from chronic ground itch there wa a lady who came around sometimes and asked mayella why she didn t stay in school she wrote down the answer with two member of the family reading and writing there wa no need for the rest of them to learn papa needed them at home miss mayella said atticus in spite of himself a nineteen year old girl like you must have friend who are your friend the witness frowned a if puzzled friend yes don t you know anyone near your age or older or younger boy and girl just ordinary friend mayella s hostility which had subsided to grudging neutrality flared again you makin fun o me agin mr finch atticus let her question answer his do you love your father miss mayella wa his next love him whatcha mean i mean is he good to you is he easy to get along with he doe tollable cept when except when mayella looked at her father who wa sitting with his chair tipped against the railing

doe he ever go after you how you mean when he s riled ha he ever beaten you mayella looked around down at the court reporter up at the judge answer the question miss mayella said judge taylor my paw s never touched a hair o my head in my life she declared firmly he never touched me atticus s glass had slipped a little and he pushed them up on his nose we ve had a good visit miss mayella and now i

mean did you know who he wa where he lived mayella nodded i knowed who he wa he passed the house every day wa this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence mayella jumped slightly at the question atticus wa making his slow pilgrimage to the window a he had been doing he would ask a question then look out waiting for an answer he did not see her involuntary jump but it seemed to me that he knew she had moved he turned around and raised his eyebrow wa he began again yes it wa didn t you ever ask him to come inside the fence before she wa prepared now i did not i certainly did not one did not s enough said atticus serenely you never asked him to do odd job for you before i mighta conceded mayella there wa several nigger around can you remember any other occasion no all right now to what happened you said tom robinson wa behind you in the room when you turned around that right yes you said he got you around the neck cussing and saying dirt is that right t s right atticus s memory had suddenly become accurate you say he caught me and choked me and took advantage of me is that right that s what i said do you remember him beating you about the face the witness hesitated you seem sure enough that he choked you all this time you were fighting back remember you kicked and hollered a loud a you could do you remember him beating you about the face mayella wa silent she seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself i thought for a moment she wa doing mr heck tate s and my trick of pretending there wa a person in front of u she glanced at mr gilmer it s an easy question miss mayella so i ll try again do you remember him beating you about the face atticus s voice had lost it comfortableness he wa speaking in his arid detached professional voice do you remember him beating you about the face no i don t recollect if he hit me i mean yes i do he hit me wa your last sentence your answer huh yes he hit i just don t remember i just don t remember it all happened so quick judge taylor looked sternly at mayella don t you cry young woman he began but atticus said let her cry if she want to judge we ve got all the time in the world mayella sniffed wrathfully and looked at atticus i ll answer any question you got get me up here an mock me will you i ll answer any question you got that s fine said atticus there re only a few more miss mayella not to be tedious you ve testified that the defendant hit you grabbed you around the neck choked you and took advantage of you i want you to be sure you have the right man will you identify the man who raped you i will that s him right yonder atticus turned to the defendant tom stand up let miss mayella have a good long look at you is this the man miss mayella tom robinson s powerful shoulder rippled under his thin shirt he rose to his foot and stood with his right hand on the back of his chair he looked oddly off balance but it wa not from the way he wa standing his left arm wa fully twelve inch shorter than his right and hung dead at his side it ended in a small shriveled hand and from a far away a the balcony i could see that it wa no use to him scout breathed jem scout look reverend he s crippled reverend sykes leaned across me and whispered to jem he got it caught in a cotton gin caught it in mr dolphus raymond s cotton gin when he wa a boy like to bled to death tore all the muscle loose from his bone atticus said is this the man who raped you it most certainly is atticus s next question wa one word long how mayella wa raging i don t know how he done it but he done it i said it all happened so fast i now let s consider this calmly began atticus but mr gilmer interrupted with an objection he wa not irrelevant or immaterial but atticus wa browbeating the witness judge taylor laughed outright oh sit down horace he s doing nothing of the sort if anything the witness s browbeating atticus judge taylor wa the only person in the courtroom who laughed even the baby were still and i suddenly wondered if they had been smothered at their mother breast now said atticus miss mayella you ve testified that the defendant choked and beat you you didn t say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you cold but you turned around and there he wa atticus wa back behind his table and he emphasized his word by tapping his knuckle on it do you wish to reconsider any of your testimony you want me to say something that didn t happen no ma am i want you to say something that did happen tell u once more please what happened i told ja what happened you testified that you turned around and there he wa he choked you then yes then he released your throat and hit you i said he did he blacked your left eye with his right fist i ducked and it it glanced that s what it did i ducked and it glanced off mayella had finally seen the light you re becoming suddenly clear on this point a while ago you couldn t remember too well could you i said he hit me all right he choked you he hit you then he raped you that right it most certainly is you re a strong girl what were you doing all the time just standing there i told ja i hollered n kicked n fought atticus reached up and took off his glass turned his good right eye to the witness and rained question on her judge taylor said one question at a time atticus give the witness a chance to answer all right why didn t you run i tried tried to what kept you from it i he slung me down that s what he did he slung me down n got on top of me you were screaming all this time i certainly wa then why didn t the other child hear you where were they at the dump where were they no answer why didn t your scream make them come running the dump s closer than the wood isn t it no answer or didn t you scream until you saw your father in the window you didn t think to scream until then did you no answer did you scream first at your father instead of at tom robinson wa that it no answer who beat you up tom robinson or your father no answer what did your father see in the window the crime of rape or the best defense to it why don t you tell the truth child didn t bob ewell beat you up when atticus turned away from mayella he looked like his stomach hurt but mayella s face wa a mixture of terror and fury atticus sat down wearily and polished his glass with his handkerchief suddenly mayella became articulate i got somethin to say she said atticus raised his head do you want to tell u what happened but she did not hear the compassion in his invitation i got somethin to say an then i ain t gon na say no more that nigger yonder took advantage of me an if you fine fancy gentleman don t wanta do nothin about it then you re all yellow stinkin coward stinkin coward the lot of you your fancy air don t come to nothin your ma amin and miss mayellerin don t come to nothin mr finch then she burst into real tear her shoulder shook with angry sob she wa a good a her word she answered no more question even when mr gilmer tried to get her back on the track i guess if she hadn t been so poor and ignorant judge taylor would have put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown everybody in the courtroom somehow atticus had hit her hard in a way that wa not clear to me but it gave him no pleasure to do so he sat with his head down and i never saw anybody glare at anyone with the hatred mayella showed when she left the stand and walked by atticus s table when mr gilmer told judge taylor that the state rested judge taylor said it s time we all did we ll take ten minute atticus and mr gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered then they left the courtroom by a door behind the witness stand which wa a signal for u all to stretch i discovered that i had been sitting on the edge of the long bench and i wa somewhat numb jem got up and yawned dill did likewise and reverend sykes wiped his face on his hat the temperature wa an easy ninety he said mr braxton underwood who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the press soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain allowed his bitter eye to rove over the colored balcony and they met mine he gave a snort and looked away jem i said mr underwood s seen u that s okay he won t tell atticus he ll just put it on the social side of the tribune jem turned back to dill explaining i suppose the finer point of the trial to him but i wondered what they were there had been no lengthy debate between atticus and mr gilmer on any point mr gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly witness had been led by the nose a ass are with few objection but atticus had once told u that in judge taylor s court any lawyer who wa a strict constructionist on evidence usually wound up receiving strict instruction from the bench he distilled this for me to mean that judge taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep but he wa seldom reversed and that wa the proof of the pudding atticus said he wa a good judge presently judge taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair he took a cigar from his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully i punched dill having passed the judge s inspection the cigar suffered a vicious bite we come down sometimes to watch him i explained it s gon na take him the rest of the afternoon now you watch unaware of public scrutiny from above judge taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lip and saying fhluck he hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh bet he wa hell with a spitball murmured dill a a rule a recess meant a general exodus but today people weren t moving even the idler who had failed to shame younger men from their seat had remained standing along the wall i guess mr heck tate had reserved the county toilet for court official atticus and mr gilmer returned and judge taylor looked at his watch it s gettin on to four he said which wa intriguing a the courthouse clock must have struck the hour at least twice i had not heard it or felt it vibration shall we try to wind up this afternoon asked judge taylor how bout it atticus i think we can said atticus how many witness you got one well call him content prev next chapter thomas robinson reached around ran his finger under his left arm and lifted it he guided his arm to the bible and his rubber like left hand sought contact with the black binding a he raised his right hand the useless one slipped off the bible and hit the clerk s table he wa trying again when judge taylor growled that ll do tom tom took the oath and stepped into the witness chair atticus very quickly induced him to tell u tom wa twenty five year of age he wa married with three child he had been in trouble with the law before he once received thirty day for disorderly conduct it must have been disorderly said atticus what did it consist of got in a fight with another man he tried to cut me did he succeed yes suh a little not enough to hurt you see i tom moved his left shoulder yes said atticus you were both convicted yes suh i had to serve cause i couldn t pay the fine other fellow paid his n dill leaned across me and asked jem what atticus wa doing jem said atticus wa showing the jury that tom had nothing to hide were you acquainted with mayella violet ewell asked atticus yes suh i had to pas her place goin to and from the field every day whose field i pick for mr link dea were you picking cotton in november no suh i work in his yard fall an wintertime i work pretty steady for him all year round he s got a lot of pecan tree n thing you say you had to pas the ewell place to get to and from work is there any other way to go no suh none s i know of tom did she ever speak to you why yes suh i d tip m hat when i d go by and one day she asked me to come inside the fence and bust up a chiffarobe for her when did she ask you to chop up the the chiffarobe mr finch it wa way last spring i remember it because it wa choppin time and i had my hoe with me i said i didn t have nothin but this hoe but she said she had a hatchet she give me the hatchet and i broke up the chiffarobe she said i reckon i ll hafta give you a nickel won t i an i said no ma am there ain t no charge then i went home mr finch that wa way last spring way over a year ago did you ever go on the place again yes suh when well i went lot of time judge taylor instinctively reached for his gavel but let his hand fall the murmur below u died without his help under what circumstance please suh why did you go inside the fence lot of time tom robinson s forehead relaxed she d call me in suh seemed like every time i passed by yonder she d have some little somethin for me to do choppin kindlin totin water for her she watered them red flower every day were you paid for your service no suh not after she offered me a nickel the first time i wa glad to do it mr ewell didn t seem to help her none and neither did the chillun and i knowed she didn t have no nickel to spare where were the other child they wa always around all over the place they d watch me work some of em some of em d set in the window would miss mayella talk to you yes sir she talked to me a tom robinson gave his testimony it came to me that mayella ewell must have been the loneliest person in the world she wa even lonelier than boo radley who had not been out of the house in twenty five year when atticus asked had she any friend she seemed not to know what he meant then she thought he wa making fun of her she wa a sad i thought a what jem called a mixed child white people wouldn t have anything to do with her because she lived among pig negro wouldn t have anything to do with her because she wa white she couldn t live like mr dolphus raymond who preferred the company of negro because she didn t own a riverbank and she wasn t from a fine old family nobody said that s just their way about the ewells maycomb gave them christmas basket welfare money and the back of it hand tom robinson wa probably the only person who wa ever decent to her but she said he took advantage of her and when she stood up she looked at him a if he were dirt beneath her foot did you ever atticus interrupted my meditation at any time go on the ewell property did you ever set foot on the ewell property without an express invitation from one of them no suh mr finch i never did i wouldn t do that suh atticus sometimes said that one way to tell whether a witness wa lying or telling the truth wa to listen rather than watch i applied his test tom denied it three time in one breath but quietly with no hint of whining in his voice and i found myself believing him in spite of his protesting too much he seemed to be a respectable negro and a respectable negro would never go up into somebody s yard of his own volition tom what happened to you on the evening of november twenty first of last year below u the spectator drew a collective breath and leaned forward behind u the negro did the same tom wa a black velvet negro not shiny but soft black velvet the white of his eye shone in his face and when he spoke we saw flash of his teeth if he had been whole he would have been a fine specimen of a man mr finch he said i wa goin home a usual that evenin an when i passed the ewell place miss mayella were on the porch like she said she were it seemed real quiet like an i didn t quite know why i wa studyin why just passin by when she say for me to come there and help her a minute well i went inside the fence an looked around for some kindlin to work on but i didn t see none and she say naw i got somethin for you to do in the house th old door s off it hinge an fall s comin on pretty fast i said you got a screwdriver miss mayella she said she sho had well i went up the step an she motioned me to come inside and i went in the front room an looked at the door i said miss mayella this door look all right i pulled it back n forth and those hinge wa all right then she shet the door in my face mr finch i wa wonderin why it wa so quiet like an it come to me that there weren t a chile on the place not a one of em and i said miss mayella where the chillun tom s black velvet skin had begun to shine and he ran his hand over his face i say where the chillun he continued an she say she wa laughin sort of she say they all gone to town to get ice cream she say took me a slap year to save seb m nickel but i done it they all gone to town tom s discomfort wa not from the humidity what did you say then tom asked atticus i said somethin like why miss mayella that s right smart o you to treat em an she said you think so i don t think she understood what i wa thinkin i meant it wa smart of her to save like that an nice of her to treat em i understand you tom go on said atticus well i said i best be goin i couldn t do nothin for her an she say oh yes i could an i ask her what and she say to just step on that chair yonder an git that box down from on top of the chiffarobe not the same chiffarobe you busted up asked atticus the witness smiled naw suh another one most a tall a the room so i done what she told me an i wa just reachin when the next thing i know she she d grabbed me round the leg grabbed me round th leg mr finch she scared me so bad i hopped down an turned the chair over that wa the only thing only furniture sturbed in that room mr finch when i left it i swear fore god what happened after you turned the chair over tom robinson had come to a dead stop he glanced at atticus then at the jury then at mr underwood sitting across the room tom you re sworn to tell the whole truth will you tell it tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth what happened after that answer the question said judge taylor one third of his cigar had vanished mr finch i got down offa that chair an turned around an she sorta jumped on me jumped on you violently no suh she she hugged me she hugged me round the waist this time judge taylor s gavel came down with a bang and a it did the overhead light went on in the courtroom darkness had not come but the afternoon sun had left the window judge taylor quickly restored order then what did she do the witness swallowed hard she reached up an kissed me side of th face she say she never kissed a grown man before an she might a well kiss a nigger she say what her papa do to her don t count she say kiss me back nigger i say miss mayella lem me outa here an tried to run but she got her back to the door an i da had to push her i didn t wanta harm her mr finch an i say lem me pas but just when i say it mr ewell yonder hollered through th window what did he say tom robinson swallowed again and his eye widened somethin not fittin to say not fittin for these folk n chillun to hear what did he say tom you must tell the jury what he said tom robinson shut his eye tight he say you goddamn whore i ll kill ya then what happened mr finch i wa runnin so fast i didn t know what happened tom did you rape mayella ewell i did not suh did you harm her in any way i did not suh did you resist her advance mr finch i tried i tried to thout bein ugly to her i didn t wanta be ugly i didn t wanta push her or nothin it occurred to me that in their own way tom robinson s manner were a good a atticus s until my father explained it to me later i did not understand the subtlety of tom s predicament he would not have dared strike a white woman under any circumstance and expect to live long so he took the first opportunity to run a sure sign of guilt tom go back once more to mr ewell said atticus did he say anything to you not anything suh he mighta said somethin but i weren t there that ll do atticus cut in sharply what you did hear who wa he talking to mr finch he were talkin and lookin at miss mayella then you ran i sho did suh why did you run i wa scared suh why were you scared mr finch if you wa a nigger like me you d be scared too atticus sat down mr gilmer wa making his way to the witness stand but before he got there mr link dea rose from the audience and announced i just want the whole lot of you to know one thing right now that boy s worked for me eight year an i ain t had a speck o trouble outa him not a speck shut your mouth sir judge taylor wa wide awake and roaring he wa also pink in the face his speech wa miraculously unimpaired by his cigar link dea he yelled if you have anything you want to say you can say it under oath and at the proper time but until then you get out of this room you hear me get out of this room sir you hear me i ll be damned if i ll listen to this case again judge taylor looked dagger at atticus a if daring him to speak but atticus had ducked his head and wa laughing into his lap i remembered something he had said about judge taylor s ex cathedra remark sometimes exceeding his duty but that few lawyer ever did anything about them i looked at jem but jem shook his head it ain t like one of the juryman got up and started talking he said i think it d be different then mr link wa just disturbin the peace or something judge taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written down after mr finch if you were a nigger like me you d be scared too and told the jury to disregard the interruption he looked suspiciously down the middle aisle and waited i suppose for mr link dea to effect total departure then he said go ahead mr gilmer you were given thirty day once for disorderly conduct robinson asked mr gilmer yes suh what d the nigger look like when you got through with him he beat me mr gilmer yes but you were convicted weren t you atticus raised his head it wa a misdemeanor and it s in the record judge i thought he sounded tired witness ll answer though said judge taylor just a wearily yes suh i got thirty day i knew that mr gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who wa convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take advantage of mayella ewell that wa the only reason he cared reason like that helped robinson you re pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one hand aren t you yes suh i reckon so strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor i never done that suh but you are strong enough to i reckon so suh had your eye on her a long time hadn t you boy no suh i never looked at her then you were mighty polite to do all that chopping and hauling for her weren t you boy i wa just tryin to help her out suh that wa mighty generous of you you had chore at home after your regular work didn t you yes suh why didn t you do them instead of miss ewell s i done em both suh you must have been pretty busy why why what suh why were you so anxious to do that woman s chore tom robinson hesitated searching for an answer looked like she didn t have nobody to help her like i say with mr ewell and seven child on the place boy well i say it looked like they never help her none you did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness boy tried to help her i say mr gilmer smiled grimly at the jury you re a mighty good fellow it seems did all this for not one penny yes suh i felt right sorry for her she seemed to try more n the rest of em you felt sorry for her you felt sorry for he mr gilmer seemed ready to rise to the ceiling the witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair but the damage wa done below u nobody liked tom robinson s answer mr gilmer paused a long time to let it sink in now you went by the house a usual last november twenty first he said and she asked you to come in and bust up a chiffarobe no suh do you deny that you went by the house no suh she said she had somethin for me to do inside the house she say she asked you to bust up a chiffarobe is that right no suh it ain t then you say she s lying boy atticus wa on his foot but tom robinson didn t need him i don t say she s lyin mr gilmer i say she s mistaken in her mind to the next ten question a mr gilmer reviewed mayella s version of event the witness s steady answer wa that she wa mistaken in her mind didn t mr ewell run you off the place boy no suh i don t think he did don t think what do you mean i mean i didn t stay long enough for him to run me off you re very candid about this why did you run so fast i say i wa scared suh if you had a clear conscience why were you scared like i say before it weren t safe for any nigger to be in a fix like that but you weren t in a fix you testified that you were resisting miss ewell were you so scared that she d hurt you you ran a big buck like you no suh i s scared i d be in court just like i am now scared of arrest scared you d have to face up to what you did no suh scared i d hafta face up to what i didn t do are you being impudent to me boy no suh i didn t go to be this wa a much a i heard of mr gilmer s cross examination because jem made me take dill out for some reason dill had started cry and couldn t stop quietly at first then his sob were heard by several people in the balcony jem said if i didn t go with him he d make me and reverend sykes said i d better go so i went dill had seemed to be all right that day nothing wrong with him but i guessed he hadn t fully recovered from running away ain t you feeling good i asked when we reached the bottom of the stair dill tried to pull himself together a we ran down the south step mr link dea wa a lonely figure on the top step anything happenin scout he asked a we went by no sir i answered over my shoulder dill here he s sick come on out under the tree i said heat got you i expect we chose the fattest live oak and we sat under it it wa just him i couldn t stand dill said who tom that old mr gilmer doin him thataway talking so hateful to him dill that s his job why if we didn t have prosecutor well we couldn t have defense attorney i reckon dill exhaled patiently i know all that scout it wa the way he said it made me sick plain sick he s supposed to act that way dill he wa cross he didn t act that way when dill those were his own witness well mr finch didn t act that way to mayella and old man ewell when he crossexamined them the way that man called him boy all the time an sneered at him an looked around at the jury every time he answered well dill after all he s just a negro i don t care one speck it ain t right somehow it ain t right to do em that way hasn t anybody got any business talkin like that it just make me sick that s just mr gilmer s way dill he doe em all that way you ve never seen him get good n down on one yet why when well today mr gilmer seemed to me like he wasn t half trying they do em all that way most lawyer i mean mr finch doesn t he s not an example dill he s i wa trying to grope in my memory for a sharp phrase of miss maudie atkinson s i had it he s the same in the courtroom a he is on the public street that s not what i mean said dill i know what you mean boy said a voice behind u we thought it came from the tree trunk but it belonged to mr dolphus raymond he peered around the trunk at u you aren t thin hided it just make you sick doesn t it content prev next chapter come on round here son i got something that ll settle your stomach a mr dolphus raymond wa an evil man i accepted his invitation reluctantly but i followed dill somehow i didn t think atticus would like it if we became friendly with mr raymond and i knew aunt alexandra wouldn t here he said offering dill his paper sack with straw in it take a good sip it ll quieten you dill sucked on the straw smiled and pulled at length hee hee said mr raymond evidently taking delight in corrupting a child dill you watch out now i warned dill released the straw and grinned scout it s nothing but coca cola mr raymond sat up against the tree trunk he had been lying on the grass you little folk won t tell on me now will you it d ruin my reputation if you did you mean all you drink in that sack s coca cola just plain coca cola yes ma am mr raymond nodded i liked his smell it wa of leather horse cottonseed he wore the only english riding boot i had ever seen that s all i drink most of the time then you just pretend you re half i beg your pardon sir i caught myself i didn t mean to be mr raymond chuckled not at all offended and i tried to frame a discreet question why do you do like you do wh oh yes you mean why do i pretend well it s very simple he said some folk don t like the way i live now i could say the hell with em i don t care if they don t like it i do say i don t care if they don t like it right enough but i don t say the hell with em see dill and i said no sir i try to give em a reason you see it help folk if they can latch onto a reason when i come to town which is seldom if i weave a little and drink out of this sack folk can say dolphus raymond s in the clutch of whiskey that s why he won t change his way he can t help himself that s why he life the way he doe that ain t honest mr raymond making yourself out badder n you are already it ain t honest but it s mighty helpful to folk secretly miss finch i m not much of a drinker but you see they could never never understand that i live like i do because that s the way i want to live i had a feeling that i shouldn t be here listening to this sinful man who had mixed child and didn t care who knew it but he wa fascinating i had never encountered a being who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself but why had he entrusted u with his deepest secret i asked him why because you re child and you can understand it he said and because i heard that one he jerked his head at dill thing haven t caught up with that one s instinct yet let him get a little older and he won t get sick and cry maybe thing ll strike him a being not quite right say but he won t cry not when he get a few year on him cry about what mr raymond dill s maleness wa beginning to assert itself cry about the simple hell people give other people without even thinking cry about the hell white people give colored folk without even stopping to think that they re people too atticus say cheatin a colored man is ten time worse than cheatin a white man i muttered say it s the worst thing you can do mr raymond said i don t reckon it s miss jean louise you don t know your pa s not a run of the mill man it ll take a few year for that to sink in you haven t seen enough of the world yet you haven t even seen this town but all you got ta do is step back inside the courthouse which reminded me that we were missing nearly all of mr gilmer s crossexamination i looked at the sun and it wa dropping fast behind the store top on the west side of the square between two fire i could not decide which i wanted to jump into mr raymond or the th judicial circuit court c mon dill i said you all right now yeah glad t ve metcha mr raymond and thanks for the drink it wa mighty settlin we raced back to the courthouse up the step up two flight of stair and edged our way along the balcony rail reverend sykes had saved our seat the courtroom wa still and again i wondered where the baby were judge taylor s cigar wa a brown speck in the center of his mouth mr gilmer wa writing on one of the yellow pad on his table trying to outdo the court reporter whose hand wa jerking rapidly shoot i muttered we missed it atticus wa halfway through his speech to the jury he had evidently pulled some paper from his briefcase that rested beside his chair because they were on his table tom robinson wa toying with them absence of any corroborative evidence this man wa indicted on a capital charge and is now on trial for his life i punched jem how long s he been at it he s just gone over the evidence jem whispered and we re gon na win scout i don t see how we can t he s been at it bout five minute he made it a plain and easy a well a i da explained it to you you could ve understood it even did mr gilmer sh h nothing new just the usual hush now we looked down again atticus wa speaking easily with the kind of detachment he used when he dictated a letter he walked slowly up and down in front of the jury and the jury seemed to be attentive their head were up and they followed atticus s route with what seemed to be appreciation i guess it wa because atticus wasn t a thunderer atticus paused then he did something he didn t ordinarily do he unhitched his watch and chain and placed them on the table saying with the court s permission judge taylor nodded and then atticus did something i never saw him do before or since in public or in private he unbuttoned his vest unbuttoned his collar loosened his tie and took off his coat he never loosened a scrap of his clothing until he undressed at bedtime and to jem and me this wa the equivalent of him standing before u stark naked we exchanged horrified glance atticus put his hand in his pocket and a he returned to the jury i saw his gold collar button and the tip of his pen and pencil winking in the light gentleman he said jem and i again looked at each other atticus might have said scout his voice had lost it aridity it detachment and he wa talking to the jury a if they were folk on the post office corner gentleman he wa saying i shall be brief but i would like to use my remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one it requires no minute sifting of complicated fact but it doe require you to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt a to the guilt of the defendant to begin with this case should never have come to trial this case is a simple a black and white the state ha not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime tom robinson is charged with ever took place it ha relied instead upon the testimony of two witness whose evidence ha not only been called into serious question on cross examination but ha been flatly contradicted by the defendant the defendant is not guilty but somebody in this courtroom is i have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state but my pity doe not extend so far a to her putting a man s life at stake which she ha done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt i say guilt gentleman because it wa guilt that motivated her she ha committed no crime she ha merely broken a rigid and time honored code of our society a code so severe that whoever break it is hounded from our midst a unfit to live with she is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance but i can not pity her she is white she knew full well the enormity of her offense but because her desire were stronger than the code she wa breaking she persisted in breaking it she persisted and her subsequent reaction is something that all of u have known at one time or another she did something every child ha done she tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her but in this case she wa no child hiding stolen contraband she struck out at her victim of necessity she must put him away from her he must be removed from her presence from this world she must destroy the evidence of her offense what wa the evidence of her offense tom robinson a human being she must put tom robinson away from her tom robinson wa her daily reminder of what she did what did she do she tempted a negro she wa white and she tempted a negro she did something that in our society is unspeakable she kissed a black man not an old uncle but a strong young negro man no code mattered to her before she broke it but it came crashing down on her afterwards her father saw it and the defendant ha testified a to his remark what did her father do we don t know but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that mayella ewell wa beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left we do know in part what mr ewell did he did what any god fearing persevering respectable white man would do under the circumstance he swore out a warrant no doubt signing it with his left hand and tom robinson now sits before you having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesses his right hand and so a quiet respectable humble negro who had the unmitigated temerity to feel sorry for a white woman ha had to put his word against two white people s i need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the stand you saw them for yourselves the witness for the state with the exception of the sheriff of maycomb county have presented themselves to you gentleman to this court in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted confident that you gentleman would go along with them on the assumption the evil assumption that all negro lie that all negro are basically immoral being that all negro men are not to be trusted around our woman an assumption one associate with mind of their caliber which gentleman we know is in itself a lie a black a tom robinson s skin a lie i do not have to point out to you you know the truth and the truth is this some negro lie some negro are immoral some negro men are not to be trusted around woman black or white but this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men there is not a person in this courtroom who ha never told a lie who ha never done an immoral thing and there is no man living who ha never looked upon a woman without desire atticus paused and took out his handkerchief then he took off his glass and wiped them and we saw another first we had never seen him sweat he wa one of those men whose face never perspired but now it wa shining tan one more thing gentleman before i quit thomas jefferson once said that all men are created equal a phrase that the yankee and the distaff side of the executive branch in washington are fond of hurling at u there is a tendency in this year of grace for certain people to use this phrase out of context to satisfy all condition the most ridiculous example i can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industrious because all men are created equal educator will gravely tell you the child left behind suffer terrible feeling of inferiority we know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have u believe some people are smarter than others some people have more opportunity because they re born with it some men make more money than others some lady make better cake than others some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men but there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal there is one human institution that make a pauper the equal of a rockefeller the stupid man the equal of an einstein and the ignorant man the equal of any college president that institution gentleman is a court it can be the supreme court of the united state or the humblest j p court in the land or this honorable court which you serve our court have their fault a doe any human institution but in this country our court are the great leveler and in our court all men are created equal i m no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our court and in the jury system that is no ideal to me it is a living working reality gentleman a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury a court is only a sound a it jury and a jury is only a sound a the men who make it up i am confident that you gentleman will review without passion the evidence you have heard come to a decision and restore this defendant to his family in the name of god do your duty atticus s voice had dropped and a he turned away from the jury he said something i did not catch he said it more to himself than to the court i punched jem what d he say in the name of god believe him i think that s what he said dill suddenly reached over me and tugged at jem looka yonder we followed his finger with sinking heart calpurnia wa making her way up the middle aisle walking straight toward atticus content prev next chapter she stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get judge taylor s attention she wa in a fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her hand judge taylor saw her and said it s calpurnia isn t it yes sir she said could i just pas this note to mr finch please sir it hasn t got anything to do with with the trial judge taylor nodded and atticus took the envelope from calpurnia he opened it read it content and said judge i this note is from my sister she say my child are missing haven t turned up since noon i could you i know where they are atticus mr underwood spoke up they re right up yonder in the colored balcony been there since precisely one eighteen p m our father turned around and looked up jem come down from there he called then he said something to the judge we didn t hear we climbed across reverend sykes and made our way to the staircase atticus and calpurnia met u downstairs calpurnia looked peeved but atticus looked exhausted jem wa jumping in excitement we ve won haven t we i ve no idea said atticus shortly you ve been here all afternoon go home with calpurnia and get your supper and stay home aw atticus let u come back pleaded jem please let u hear the verdict please sir the jury might be out and back in a minute we don t know but we could tell atticus wa relenting well you ve heard it all so you might a well hear the rest tell you what you all can come back when you ve eaten your supper eat slowly now you won t miss anything important and if the jury s still out you can wait with u but i expect it ll be over before you get back you think they ll acquit him that fast asked jem atticus opened his mouth to answer but shut it and left u i prayed that reverend sykes would save our seat for u but stopped praying when i remembered that people got up and left in drove when the jury wa out tonight they d overrun the drugstore the o k caf and the hotel that is unless they had brought their supper too calpurnia marched u home skin every one of you alive the very idea you child listenin to all that mister jem don t you know better n to take your little sister to that trial miss alexandra ll absolutely have a stroke of paralysis when she find out ain t fittin for child to hear the streetlight were on and we glimpsed calpurnia s indignant profile a we passed beneath them mister jem i thought you wa gettin some kinda head on your shoulder the very idea she s your little sister the very idea sir you oughta be perfectly ashamed of yourself ain t you got any sense at all i wa exhilarated so many thing had happened so fast i felt it would take year to sort them out and now here wa calpurnia giving her precious jem down the country what new marvel would the evening bring jem wa chuckling don t you want to hear about it cal hush your mouth sir when you oughta be hangin your head in shame you go along laughin calpurnia revived a series of rusty threat that moved jem to little remorse and she sailed up the front step with her classic if mr finch don t wear you out i will get in that house sir jem went in grinning and calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having dill in to supper you all call miss rachel right now and tell her where you are she told him she s run distracted lookin for you you watch out she don t ship you back to meridian first thing in the mornin aunt alexandra met u and nearly fainted when calpurnia told her where we were i guess it hurt her when we told her atticus said we could go back because she didn t say a word during supper she just rearranged food on her plate looking at it sadly while calpurnia served jem dill and me with a vengeance calpurnia poured milk dished out potato salad and ham muttering shamed of yourselves in varying degree of intensity now you all eat slow wa her final command reverend sykes had saved our place we were surprised to find that we had been gone nearly an hour and were equally surprised to find the courtroom exactly a we had left it with minor change the jury box wa empty the defendant wa gone judge taylor had been gone but he reappeared a we were seating ourselves nobody s moved hardly said jem they moved around some when the jury went out said reverend sykes the menfolk down there got the womenfolk their supper and they fed their baby how long have they been out asked jem bout thirty minute mr finch and mr gilmer did some more talkin and judge taylor charged the jury how wa he asked jem what say oh he did right well i ain t complainin one bit he wa mighty fairminded he sorta said if you believe this then you ll have to return one verdict but if you believe this you ll have to return another one i thought he wa leanin a little to our side reverend sykes scratched his head jem smiled he s not supposed to lean reverend but don t fret we ve won it he said wisely don t see how any jury could convict on what we heard now don t you be so confident mr jem i ain t ever seen any jury decide in favor of a colored man over a white man but jem took exception to reverend sykes and we were subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with jem s idea on the law regarding rape it wasn t rape if she let you but she had to be eighteen in alabama that is and mayella wa nineteen apparently you had to kick and holler you had to be overpowered and stomped on preferably knocked stone cold if you were under eighteen you didn t have to go through all this mr jem reverend sykes demurred this ain t a polite thing for little lady to hear aw she doesn t know what we re talkin about said jem scout this is too old for you ain t it it most certainly is not i know every word you re saying perhaps i wa too convincing because jem hushed and never discussed the subject again what time is it reverend he asked gettin on toward eight i looked down and saw atticus strolling around with his hand in his pocket he made a tour of the window then walked by the railing over to the jury box he looked in it inspected judge taylor on his throne then went back to where he started i caught his eye and waved to him he acknowledged my salute with a nod and resumed his tour mr gilmer wa standing at the window talking to mr underwood bert the court reporter wa chain smoking he sat back with his foot on the table but the officer of the court the one present atticus mr gilmer judge taylor sound asleep and bert were the only one whose behavior seemed normal i had never seen a packed courtroom so still sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully and a child would scurry out but the grown people sat a if they were in church in the balcony the negro sat and stood around u with biblical patience the old courthouse clock suffered it preliminary strain and struck the hour eight deafening bong that shook our bone when it bonged eleven time i wa past feeling tired from fighting sleep i allowed myself a short nap against reverend sykes s comfortable arm and shoulder i jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so by looking down and concentrating on the head below there were sixteen bald one fourteen men that could pas for redhead forty head varying between brown and black and i remembered something jem had once explained to me when he went through a brief period of psychical research he said if enough people a stadium full maybe were to concentrate on one thing such a setting a tree afire in the wood that the tree would ignite of it own accord i toyed with the idea of asking everyone below to concentrate on setting tom robinson free but thought if they were a tired a i it wouldn t work dill wa sound asleep his head on jem s shoulder and jem wa quiet ain t it a long time i asked him sure is scout he said happily well from the way you put it it d just take five minute jem raised his eyebrow there are thing you don t understand he said and i wa too weary to argue but i must have been reasonably awake or i would not have received the impression that wa creeping into me it wa not unlike one i had last winter and i shivered though the night wa hot the feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom wa exactly the same a a cold february morning when the mockingbird were still and the carpenter had stopped hammering on miss maudie s new house and every wood door in the neighborhood wa shut a tight a the door of the radley place a deserted waiting empty street and the courtroom wa packed with people a steaming summer night wa no different from a winter morning mr heck tate who had entered the courtroom and wa talking to atticus might have been wearing his high boot and lumber jacket atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung of a chair a he listened to what mr tate wa saying he ran his hand slowly up and down his thigh i expected mr tate to say any minute take him mr finch but mr tate said this court will come to order in a voice that rang with authority and the head below u jerked up mr tate left the room and returned with tom robinson he steered tom to his place beside atticus and stood there judge taylor had roused himself to sudden alertness and wa sitting up straight looking at the empty jury box what happened after that had a dreamlike quality in a dream i saw the jury return moving like underwater swimmer and judge taylor s voice came from far away and wa tiny i saw something only a lawyer s child could be expected to see could be expected to watch for and it wa like watching atticus walk into the street raise a rifle to his shoulder and pull the trigger but watching all the time knowing that the gun wa empty a jury never look at a defendant it ha convicted and when this jury came in not one of them looked at tom robinson the foreman handed a piece of paper to mr tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to the judge i shut my eye judge taylor wa polling the jury guilty guilty guilty guilty i peeked at jem his hand were white from gripping the balcony rail and his shoulder jerked a if each guilty wa a separate stab between them judge taylor wa saying something his gavel wa in his fist but he wasn t using it dimly i saw atticus pushing paper from the table into his briefcase he snapped it shut went to the court reporter and said something nodded to mr gilmer and then went to tom robinson and whispered something to him atticus put his hand on tom s shoulder a he whispered atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder then he left the courtroom but not by his usual exit he must have wanted to go home the short way because he walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit i followed the top of his head a he made his way to the door he did not look up someone wa punching me but i wa reluctant to take my eye from the people below u and from the image of atticus s lonely walk down the aisle miss jean louise i looked around they were standing all around u and in the balcony on the opposite wall the negro were getting to their foot reverend sykes s voice wa a distant a judge taylor s miss jean louise stand up your father s passin content prev next chapter it wa jem s turn to cry his face wa streaked with angry tear a we made our way through the cheerful crowd it ain t right he muttered all the way to the corner of the square where we found atticus waiting atticus wa standing under the street light looking a though nothing had happened his vest wa buttoned his collar and tie were neatly in place his watch chain glistened he wa his impassive self again it ain t right atticus said jem no son it s not right we walked home aunt alexandra wa waiting up she wa in her dressing gown and i could have sworn she had on her corset underneath it i m sorry brother she murmured having never heard her call atticus brother before i stole a glance at jem but he wa not listening he would look up at atticus then down at the floor and i wondered if he thought atticus somehow responsible for tom robinson s conviction is he all right aunty asked indicating jem he ll be so presently said atticus it wa a little too strong for him our father sighed i m going to bed he said if i don t wake up in the morning don t call me i didn t think it wise in the first place to let them this is their home sister said atticus we ve made it this way for them they might a well learn to cope with it but they don t have to go to the courthouse and wallow in it it s just a much maycomb county a missionary tea atticus aunt alexandra s eye were anxious you are the last person i thought would turn bitter over this i m not bitter just tired i m going to bed atticus said jem bleakly he turned in the doorway what son how could they do it how could they i don t know but they did it they ve done it before and they did it tonight and they ll do it again and when they do it seems that only child weep good night but thing are always better in the morning atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour and wa in the livingroom behind the mobile register when we stumbled in jem s morning face posed the question his sleepy lip struggled to ask it s not time to worry yet atticus reassured him a we went to the diningroom we re not through yet there ll be an appeal you can count on that gracious alive cal what s all this he wa staring at his breakfast plate calpurnia said tom robinson s daddy sent you along this chicken this morning i fixed it you tell him i m proud to get it bet they don t have chicken for breakfast at the white house what are these roll said calpurnia estelle down at the hotel sent em atticus looked up at her puzzled and she said you better step out here and see what s in the kitchen mr finch we followed him the kitchen table wa loaded with enough food to bury the family hunk of salt pork tomato bean even scuppernong atticus grinned when he found a jar of pickled pig knuckle reckon aunty ll let me eat these in the diningroom calpurnia said this wa all round the back step when i got here this morning they they preciate what you did mr finch they they aren t oversteppin themselves are they atticus s eye filled with tear he did not speak for a moment tell them i m very grateful he said tell them tell them they must never do this again time are too hard he left the kitchen went in the diningroom and excused himself to aunt alexandra put on his hat and went to town we heard dill s step in the hall so calpurnia left atticus s uneaten breakfast on the table between rabbit bite dill told u of miss rachel s reaction to last night which wa if a man like atticus finch want to butt his head against a stone wall it s his head i da got her told growled dill gnawing a chicken leg but she didn t look much like tellin this morning said she wa up half the night wonderin where i wa said she da had the sheriff after me but he wa at the hearing dill you ve got to stop goin off without tellin her said jem it just aggravates her dill sighed patiently i told her till i wa blue in the face where i wa goin she s just seein too many snake in the closet bet that woman drink a pint for breakfast every morning know she drink two glass full seen her don t talk like that dill said aunt alexandra it s not becoming to a child it s cynical i ain t cynical miss alexandra tellin the truth s not cynical is it the way you tell it it is jem s eye flashed at her but he said to dill let s go you can take that runner with you when we went to the front porch miss stephanie crawford wa busy telling it to miss maudie atkinson and mr avery they looked around at u and went on talking jem made a feral noise in his throat i wished for a weapon i hate grown folk lookin at you said dill make you feel like you ve done something miss maudie yelled for jem finch to come there jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing we ll go with you dill said miss stephanie s nose quivered with curiosity she wanted to know who all gave u permission to go to court she didn t see u but it wa all over town this morning that we were in the colored balcony did atticus put u up there a a sort of wasn t it right close up there with all those did scout understand all the didn t it make u mad to see our daddy beat hush stephanie miss maudie s diction wa deadly i ve not got all the morning to pas on the porch jem finch i called to find out if you and your colleague can eat some cake got up at five to make it so you better say yes excuse u stephanie good morning mr avery there wa a big cake and two little one on miss maudie s kitchen table there should have been three little one it wa not like miss maudie to forget dill and we must have shown it but we understood when she cut from the big cake and gave the slice to jem a we ate we sensed that this wa miss maudie s way of saying that a far a she wa concerned nothing had changed she sat quietly in a kitchen chair watching u suddenly she spoke don t fret jem thing are never a bad a they seem indoors when miss maudie wanted to say something lengthy she spread her finger on her knee and settled her bridgework this she did and we waited i simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant job for u your father s one of them oh said jem well don t you oh well me sir miss maudie replied recognizing jem s fatalistic noise you are not old enough to appreciate what i said jem wa staring at his half eaten cake it s like bein a caterpillar in a cocoon that s what it is he said like somethin asleep wrapped up in a warm place i always thought maycomb folk were the best folk in the world least that s what they seemed like we re the safest folk in the world said miss maudie we re so rarely called on to be christian but when we are we ve got men like atticus to go for u jem grinned ruefully wish the rest of the county thought that you d be surprised how many of u do who jem s voice rose who in this town did one thing to help tom robinson just who his colored friend for one thing and people like u people like judge taylor people like mr heck tate stop eating and start thinking jem did it ever strike you that judge taylor naming atticus to defend that boy wa no accident that judge taylor might have had his reason for naming him this wa a thought court appointed defense were usually given to maxwell green maycomb s latest addition to the bar who needed the experience maxwell green should have had tom robinson s case you think about that miss maudie wa saying it wa no accident i wa sittin there on the porch last night waiting i waited and waited to see you all come down the sidewalk and a i waited i thought atticus finch won t win he can t win but he s the only man in these part who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that and i thought to myself well we re making a step it s just a babystep but it s a step t s all right to talk like that can t any christian judge an lawyer make up for heathen jury jem muttered soon s i get grown that s something you ll have to take up with your father miss maudie said we went down miss maudie s cool new step into the sunshine and found mr avery and miss stephanie crawford still at it they had moved down the sidewalk and were standing in front of miss stephanie s house miss rachel wa walking toward them i think i ll be a clown when i get grown said dill jem and i stopped in our track yes sir a clown he said there ain t one thing in this world i can do about folk except laugh so i m gon na join the circus and laugh my head off you got it backwards dill said jem clown are sad it s folk that laugh at them well i m gon na be a new kind of clown i m gon na stand in the middle of the ring and laugh at the folk just looka yonder he pointed every one of em oughta be ridin broomstick aunt rachel already doe miss stephanie and miss rachel were waving wildly at u in a way that did not give the lie to dill s observation oh gosh breathed jem i reckon it d be ugly not to see em something wa wrong mr avery wa red in the face from a sneezing spell and nearly blew u off the sidewalk when we came up miss stephanie wa trembling with excitement and miss rachel caught dill s shoulder you get on in the back yard and stay there she said there s danger a comin s matter i asked ain t you heard yet it s all over town at that moment aunt alexandra came to the door and called u but she wa too late it wa miss stephanie s pleasure to tell u this morning mr bob ewell stopped atticus on the post office corner spat in his face and told him he d get him if it took the rest of his life content prev next chapter i wish bob ewell wouldn t chew tobacco wa all atticus said about it according to miss stephanie crawford however atticus wa leaving the post office when mr ewell approached him cursed him spat on him and threatened to kill him miss stephanie who by the time she had told it twice wa there and had seen it all passing by from the jitney jungle she wa miss stephanie said atticus didn t bat an eye just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and stood there and let mr ewell call him name wild horse could not bring her to repeat mr ewell wa a veteran of an obscure war that plus atticus s peaceful reaction probably prompted him to inquire too proud to fight you nigger lovin bastard miss stephanie said atticus said no too old put his hand in his pocket and strolled on miss stephanie said you had to hand it to atticus finch he could be right dry sometimes jem and i didn t think it entertaining after all though i said he wa the deadest shot in the county one time he could you know he wouldn t carry a gun scout he ain t even got one said jem you know he didn t even have one down at the jail that night he told me havin a gun around s an invitation to somebody to shoot you this is different i said we can ask him to borrow one we did and he said nonsense dill wa of the opinion that an appeal to atticus s better nature might work after all we would starve if mr ewell killed him besides be raised exclusively by aunt alexandra and we all knew the first thing she d do before atticus wa under the ground good would be to fire calpurnia jem said it might work if i cried and flung a fit being young and a girl that didn t work either but when he noticed u dragging around the neighborhood not eating taking little interest in our normal pursuit atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were he tempted jem with a new football magazine one night when he saw jem flip the page and toss it aside he said what s bothering you son jem came to the point mr ewell what ha happened nothing s happened we re scared for you and we think you oughta do something about him atticus smiled wryly do what put him under a peace bond when a man say he s gon na get you look like he mean it he meant it when he said it said atticus jem see if you can stand in bob ewell s shoe a minute i destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial if he had any to begin with the man had to have some kind of comeback his kind always doe so if spitting in my face and threatening me saved mayella ewell one extra beating that s something i ll gladly take he had to take it out on somebody and i d rather it be me than that houseful of child out there you understand jem nodded aunt alexandra entered the room a atticus wa saying we don t have anything to fear from bob ewell he got it all out of his system that morning i wouldn t be so sure of that atticus she said his kind d do anything to pay off a grudge you know how those people are what on earth could ewell do to me sister something furtive aunt alexandra said you may count on that nobody ha much chance to be furtive in maycomb atticus answered after that we were not afraid summer wa melting away and we made the most of it atticus assured u that nothing would happen to tom robinson until the higher court reviewed his case and that tom had a good chance of going free or at least of having a new trial he wa at enfield prison farm seventy mile away in chester county i asked atticus if tom s wife and child were allowed to visit him but atticus said no if he loses his appeal i asked one evening what ll happen to him he ll go to the chair said atticus unless the governor commute his sentence not time to worry yet scout we ve got a good chance jem wa sprawled on the sofa reading popular mechanic he looked up it ain t right he didn t kill anybody even if he wa guilty he didn t take anybody s life you know rape s a capital offense in alabama said atticus yessir but the jury didn t have to give him death if they wanted to they could ve gave him twenty year given said atticus tom robinson s a colored man jem no jury in this part of the world s going to say we think you re guilty but not very on a charge like that it wa either a straight acquittal or nothing jem wa shaking his head i know it s not right but i can t figure out what s wrong maybe rape shouldn t be a capital offense atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair he said he didn t have any quarrel with the rape statute none what ever but he did have deep misgiving when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence he glanced at me saw i wa listening and made it easier i mean before a man is sentenced to death for murder say there should be one or two eye witness some one should be able to say yes i wa there and saw him pull the trigger but lot of folk have been hung hanged on circumstantial evidence said jem i know and lot of em probably deserved it too but in the absence of eyewitness there s always a doubt some time only the shadow of a doubt the law say reasonable doubt but i think a defendant s entitled to the shadow of a doubt there s always the possibility no matter how improbable that he s innocent then it all go back to the jury then we oughta do away with jury jem wa adamant atticus tried hard not to smile but couldn t help it you re rather hard on u son i think maybe there might be a better way change the law change it so that only judge have the power of fixing the penalty in capital case then go up to montgomery and change the law you d be surprised how hard that d be i won t live to see the law changed and if you live to see it you ll be an old man this wa not good enough for jem no sir they oughta do away with jury he wasn t guilty in the first place and they said he wa if you had been on that jury son and eleven other boy like you tom would be a free man said atticus so far nothing in your life ha interfered with your reasoning process those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life tom s jury but you saw something come between them and reason you saw the same thing that night in front of the jail when that crew went away they didn t go a reasonable men they went because we were there there s something in our world that make men lose their head they couldn t be fair if they tried in our court when it s a white man s word against a black man s the white man always win they re ugly but those are the fact of life doesn t make it right said jem stolidly he beat his fist softly on his knee you just can t convict a man on evidence like that you can t you couldn t but they could and did the older you grow the more of it you ll see the one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom be he any color of the rainbow but people have a way of carrying their resentment right into a jury box a you grow older you ll see white men cheat black men every day of your life but let me tell you something and don t you forget it whenever a white man doe that to a black man no matter who he is how rich he is or how fine a family he come from that white man is trash atticus wa speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ear i looked up and his face wa vehement there s nothing more sickening to me than a lowgrade white man who ll take advantage of a negro s ignorance don t fool yourselves it s all adding up and one of these day we re going to pay the bill for it i hope it s not in you child s time jem wa scratching his head suddenly his eye widened atticus he said why don t people like u and miss maudie ever sit on jury you never see anybody from maycomb on a jury they all come from out in the wood atticus leaned back in his rocking chair for some reason he looked pleased with jem i wa wondering when that d occur to you he said there are lot of reason for one thing miss maudie can t serve on a jury because she s a woman you mean woman in alabama can t i wa indignant i do i guess it s to protect our frail lady from sordid case like tom s besides atticus grinned i doubt if we d ever get a complete case tried the lady d be interrupting to ask question jem and i laughed miss maudie on a jury would be impressive i thought of old mr dubose in her wheelchair stop that rapping john taylor i want to ask this man something perhaps our forefather were wise atticus wa saying with people like u that s our share of the bill we generally get the jury we deserve our stout maycomb citizen aren t interested in the first place in the second place they re afraid then they re afraid why asked jem well what if say mr link dea had to decide the amount of damage to award say miss maudie when miss rachel ran over her with a car link wouldn t like the thought of losing either lady s business at his store would he so he tell judge taylor that he can t serve on the jury because he doesn t have anybody to keep store for him while he s gone so judge taylor excuse him sometimes he excuse him wrathfully what d make him think either one of em d stop trading with him i asked jem said miss rachel would miss maudie wouldn t but a jury s vote s secret atticus our father chuckled you ve many more mile to go son a jury s vote s supposed to be secret serving on a jury force a man to make up his mind and declare himself about something men don t like to do that sometimes it s unpleasant tom s jury sho made up it mind in a hurry jem muttered atticus s finger went to his watchpocket no it didn t he said more to himself than to u that wa the one thing that made me think well this may be the shadow of a beginning that jury took a few hour an inevitable verdict maybe but usually it take em just a few minute this time he broke off and looked at u you might like to know that there wa one fellow who took considerable wearing down in the beginning he wa rarin for an outright acquittal who jem wa astonished atticus s eye twinkled it s not for me to say but i ll tell you this much he wa one of your old sarum friend one of the cunningham jem yelped one of i didn t recognize any of em you re jokin he looked at atticus from the corner of his eye one of their connection on a hunch i didn t strike him just on a hunch could ve but i didn t golly moses jem said reverently one minute they re tryin to kill him and the next they re tryin to turn him loose i ll never understand those folk a long a i live atticus said you just had to know em he said the cunningham hadn t taken anything from or off of anybody since they migrated to the new world he said the other thing about them wa once you earned their respect they were for you tooth and nail atticus said he had a feeling nothing more than a suspicion that they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the finch then too he said it took a thunderbolt plus another cunningham to make one of them change his mind if we d had two of that crowd we d ve had a hung jury jem said slowly you mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill you the night before how could you take such a risk atticus how could you when you analyze it there wa little risk there s no difference between one man who s going to convict and another man who s going to convict is there there s a faint difference between a man who s going to convict and a man who s a little disturbed in his mind isn t there he wa the only uncertainty on the whole list what kin wa that man to mr walter cunningham i asked atticus rose stretched and yawned it wa not even our bedtime but we knew he wanted a chance to read his newspaper he picked it up folded it and tapped my head let s see now he droned to himself i ve got it double first cousin how can that be two sister married two brother that s all i ll tell you you figure it out i tortured myself and decided that if i married jem and dill had a sister whom he married our child would be double first cousin gee minetti jem i said when atticus had gone they re funny folk d you hear that aunty aunt alexandra wa hooking a rug and not watching u but she wa listening she sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it her rug spread across her lap why lady hooked woolen rug on boiling night never became clear to me i heard it she said i remembered the distant disastrous occasion when i rushed to young walter cunningham s defense now i wa glad i d done it soon s school start i m gon na ask walter home to dinner i planned having forgotten my private resolve to beat him up the next time i saw him he can stay over sometimes after school too atticus could drive him back to old sarum maybe he could spend the night with u sometime okay jem we ll see about that aunt alexandra said a declaration that with her wa always a threat never a promise surprised i turned to her why not aunty they re good folk she looked at me over her sewing glass jean louise there is no doubt in my mind that they re good folk but they re not our kind of folk jem say she mean they re yappy scout what s a yap aw tacky they like fiddlin and thing like that well i do too don t be silly jean louise said aunt alexandra the thing is you can scrub walter cunningham till he shine you can put him in shoe and a new suit but he ll never be like jem besides there s a drinking streak in that family a mile wide finch woman aren t interested in that sort of people aun ty said jem she ain t nine yet she may a well learn it now aunt alexandra had spoken i wa reminded vividly of the last time she had put her foot down i never knew why it wa when i wa absorbed with plan to visit calpurnia s house i wa curious interested i wanted to be her company to see how she lived who her friend were i might a well have wanted to see the other side of the moon this time the tactic were different but aunt alexandra s aim wa the same perhaps this wa why she had come to live with u to help u choose our friend i would hold her off a long a i could if they re good folk then why can t i be nice to walter i didn t say not to be nice to him you should be friendly and polite to him you should be gracious to everybody dear but you don t have to invite him home what if he wa kin to u aunty the fact is that he is not kin to u but if he were my answer would be the same aunty jem spoke up atticus say you can choose your friend but you sho can t choose your family an they re still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge em or not and it make you look right silly when you don t that s your father all over again said aunt alexandra and i still say that jean louise will not invite walter cunningham to this house if he were her double first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he come to see atticus on business now that is that she had said indeed not but this time she would give her reason but i want to play with walter aunty why can t i she took off her glass and stared at me i ll tell you why she said because he is trash that s why you can t play with him i ll not have you around him picking up his habit and learning lord know what you re enough of a problem to your father a it is i don t know what i would have done but jem stopped me he caught me by the shoulder put his arm around me and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom atticus heard u and poked his head around the door s all right sir jem said gruffly s not anything atticus went away have a chew scout jem dug into his pocket and extracted a tootsie roll it took a few minute to work the candy into a comfortable wad inside my jaw jem wa rearranging the object on his dresser his hair stuck up behind and down in front and i wondered if it would ever look like a man s maybe if he shaved it off and started over his hair would grow back neatly in place his eyebrow were becoming heavier and i noticed a new slimness about his body he wa growing taller when he looked around he must have thought i would start cry again for he said show you something if you won t tell anybody i said what he unbuttoned his shirt grinning shyly well what well can t you see it well no well it s hair where there right there he had been a comfort to me so i said it looked lovely but i didn t see anything it s real nice jem under my arm too he said goin out for football next year scout don t let aunty aggravate you it seemed only yesterday that he wa telling me not to aggravate aunty you know she s not used to girl said jem leastways not girl like you she s trying to make you a lady can t you take up sewin or somethin hell no she doesn t like me that s all there is to it and i don t care it wa her callin walter cunningham trash that got me goin jem not what she said about being a problem to atticus we got that all straight one time i asked him if i wa a problem and he said not much of one at most one that he could always figure out and not to worry my head a second about botherin him naw it wa walter that boy s not trash jem he ain t like the ewells jem kicked off his shoe and swung his foot to the bed he propped himself against a pillow and switched on the reading light you know something scout i ve got it all figured out now i ve thought about it a lot lately and i ve got it figured out there s four kind of folk in the world there s the ordinary kind like u and the neighbor there s the kind like the cunningham out in the wood the kind like the ewells down at the dump and the negro what about the chinese and the cajun down yonder in baldwin county i mean in maycomb county the thing about it is our kind of folk don t like the cunningham the cunningham don t like the ewells and the ewells hate and despise the colored folk i told jem if that wa so then why didn t tom s jury made up of folk like the cunningham acquit tom to spite the ewells jem waved my question away a being infantile you know he said i ve seen atticus pat his foot when there s fiddlin on the radio and he love pot liquor better n any man i ever saw then that make u like the cunningham i said i can t see why aunty no lem me finish it doe but we re still different somehow atticus said one time the reason aunty s so hipped on the family is because all we ve got s background and not a dime to our name well jem i don t know atticus told me one time that most of this old family stuff s foolishness because everybody s family s just a old a everybody else s i said did that include the colored folk and englishman and he said yes background doesn t mean old family said jem i think it s how long your family s been readin and writin scout i ve studied this real hard and that s the only reason i can think of somewhere along when the finch were in egypt one of em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy jem laughed imagine aunty being proud her great grandaddy could read an write lady pick funny thing to be proud of well i m glad he could or who da taught atticus and them and if atticus couldn t read you and me d be in a fix i don t think that s what background is jem well then how do you explain why the cunningham are different mr walter can hardly sign his name i ve seen him we ve just been readin and writin longer n they have no everybody s got ta learn nobody s born knowin that walter s a smart a he can be he just get held back sometimes because he ha to stay out and help his daddy nothin s wrong with him naw jem i think there s just one kind of folk folk jem turned around and punched his pillow when he settled back his face wa cloudy he wa going into one of his decline and i grew wary his brow came together his mouth became a thin line he wa silent for a while that s what i thought too he said at last when i wa your age if there s just one kind of folk why can t they get along with each other if they re all alike why do they go out of their way to despise each other scout i think i m beginning to understand something i think i m beginning to understand why boo radley s stayed shut up in the house all this time it s because he want to stay inside content prev next chapter calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron she carried a tray of charlotte she backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently i admired the ease and grace with which she handled heavy load of dainty thing so did aunt alexandra i guess because she had let calpurnia serve today august wa on the brink of september dill would be leaving for meridian tomorrow today he wa off with jem at barker s eddy jem had discovered with angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach dill how to swim a skill jem considered necessary a walking they had spent two afternoon at the creek they said they were going in naked and i couldn t come so i divided the lonely hour between calpurnia and miss maudie today aunt alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all over the house from the kitchen i heard mr grace merriweather giving a report in the livingroom on the squalid life of the mrunas it sounded like to me they put the woman out in hut when their time came whatever that wa they had no sense of family i knew that d distress aunty they subjected child to terrible ordeal when they were thirteen they were crawling with yaw and earworms they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot and then got drunk on it immediately thereafter the lady adjourned for refreshment i didn t know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out aunt alexandra told me to join them for refreshment it wa not necessary that i attend the business part of the meeting she said it d bore me i wa wearing my pink sunday dress shoe and a petticoat and reflected that if i spilled anything calpurnia would have to wash my dress again for tomorrow this had been a busy day for her i decided to stay out can i help you cal i asked wishing to be of some service calpurnia paused in the doorway you be still a a mouse in that corner she said an you can help me load up the tray when i come back the gentle hum of lady voice grew louder a she opened the door why alexandra i never saw such charlotte just lovely i never can get my crust like this never can who d ve thought of little dewberry tart calpurnia who da thought it anybody tell you that the preacher s wife s nooo well she is and that other one not walkin yet they became quiet and i knew they had all been served calpurnia returned and put my mother s heavy silver pitcher on a tray this coffee pitcher s a curiosity she murmured they don t make em these day can i carry it in if you be careful and don t drop it set it down at the end of the table by miss alexandra down there by the cup n thing she s gon na pour i tried pressing my behind against the door a calpurnia had done but the door didn t budge grinning she held it open for me careful now it s heavy don t look at it and you won t spill it my journey wa successful aunt alexandra smiled brilliantly stay with u jean louise she said this wa a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady it wa customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbor in for refreshment be they baptist or presbyterian which accounted for the presence of miss rachel sober a a judge miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford rather nervous i took a seat beside miss maudie and wondered why lady put on their hat to go across the street lady in bunch always filled me with vague apprehension and a firm desire to be elsewhere but this feeling wa what aunt alexandra called being spoiled the lady were cool in fragile pastel print most of them were heavily powdered but unrouged the only lipstick in the room wa tangee natural cutex natural sparkled on their fingernail but some of the younger lady wore rose they smelled heavenly i sat quietly having conquered my hand by tightly gripping the arm of the chair and waited for someone to speak to me miss maudie s gold bridgework twinkled you re mighty dressed up miss jean louise she said where are your britches today under my dress i hadn t meant to be funny but the lady laughed my cheek grew hot a i realized my mistake but miss maudie looked gravely down at me she never laughed at me unless i meant to be funny in the sudden silence that followed miss stephanie crawford called from across the room whatcha going to be when you grow up jean louise a lawyer nome i hadn t thought about it i answered grateful that miss stephanie wa kind enough to change the subject hurriedly i began choosing my vocation nurse aviator well why shoot i thought you wanted to be a lawyer you ve already commenced going to court the lady laughed again that stephanie s a card somebody said miss stephanie wa encouraged to pursue the subject don t you want to grow up to be a lawyer miss maudie s hand touched mine and i answered mildly enough nome just a lady miss stephanie eyed me suspiciously decided that i meant no impertinence and contented herself with well you won t get very far until you start wearing dress more often miss maudie s hand closed tightly on mine and i said nothing it warmth wa enough mr grace merriweather sat on my left and i felt it would be polite to talk to her mr merriweather a faithful methodist under duress apparently saw nothing personal in singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me it wa the general opinion of maycomb however that mr merriweather had sobered him up and made a reasonably useful citizen of him for certainly mr merriweather wa the most devout lady in maycomb i searched for a topic of interest to her what did you all study this afternoon i asked oh child those poor mrunas she said and wa off few other question would be necessary mr merriweather s large brown eye always filled with tear when she considered the oppressed living in that jungle with nobody but j grime everett she said not a white person ll go near em but that saintly j grime everett mr merriweather played her voice like an organ every word she said received it full measure the poverty the darkness the immorality nobody but j grime everett know you know when the church gave me that trip to the camp ground j grime everett said to me wa he there ma am i thought home on leave j grime everett said to me he said mr merriweather you have no conception no conception of what we are fighting over there that s what he said to me yes ma am i said to him mr everett i said the lady of the maycomb alabama methodist episcopal church south are behind you one hundred percent that s what i said to him and you know right then and there i made a pledge in my heart i said to myself when i go home i m going to give a course on the mrunas and bring j grime everett s message to maycomb and that s just what i m doing yes ma am when mr merriweather shook her head her black curl jiggled jean louise she said you are a fortunate girl you live in a christian home with christian folk in a christian town out there in j grime everett s land there s nothing but sin and squalor yes ma am sin and squalor what wa that gertrude mr merriweather turned on her chime for the lady sitting beside her oh that well i always say forgive and forget forgive and forget thing that church ought to do is help her lead a christian life for those child from here on out some of the men ought to go out there and tell that preacher to encourage her excuse me mr merriweather i interrupted are you all talking about mayella ewell may no child that darky s wife tom s wife tom robinson ma am mr merriweather turned back to her neighbor there s one thing i truly believe gertrude she continued but some people just don t see it my way if we just let them know we forgive em that we ve forgotten it then this whole thing ll blow over ah mr merriweather i interrupted once more what ll blow over again she turned to me mr merriweather wa one of those childless adult who find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to child nothing jean louise she said in stately largo the cook and field hand are just dissatisfied but they re settling down now they grumbled all next day after that trial mr merriweather faced mr farrow gertrude i tell you there s nothing more distracting than a sulky darky their mouth go down to here just ruin your day to have one of em in the kitchen you know what i said to my sophy gertrude i said sophy i said you simply are not being a christian today jesus christ never went around grumbling and complaining and you know it did her good she took her eye off that floor and said nome miz merriweather jesus never went around grumblin i tell you gertrude you never ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the lord i wa reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at finch s landing when i wa very small and if i had been very good during the day atticus would let me pump it bellow while he picked out a tune with one finger the last note would linger a long a there wa air to sustain it mr merriweather had run out of air i judged and wa replenishing her supply while mr farrow composed herself to speak mr farrow wa a splendidly built woman with pale eye and narrow foot she had a fresh permanent wave and her hair wa a mass of tight gray ringlet she wa the second most devout lady in maycomb she had a curious habit of prefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound s s s grace she said it s just like i wa telling brother hutson the other day s s s brother hutson i said look like we re fighting a losing battle a losing battle i said s s s it doesn t matter to em one bit we can educate em till we re blue in the face we can try till we drop to make christian out of em but there s no lady safe in her bed these night he said to me mr farrow i don t know what we re coming to down here s s s i told him that wa certainly a fact mr merriweather nodded wisely her voice soared over the clink of coffee cup and the soft bovine sound of the lady munching their dainty gertrude she said i tell you there are some good but misguided people in this town good but misguided folk in this town who think they re doing right i mean now far be it from me to say who but some of em in this town thought they were doing the right thing a while back but all they did wa stir em up that s all they did might ve looked like the right thing to do at the time i m sure i don t know i m not read in that field but sulky dissatisfied i tell you if my sophy d kept it up another day i d have let her go it s never entered that wool of hers that the only reason i keep her is because this depression s on and she need her dollar and a quarter every week she can get it his food doesn t stick going down doe it miss maudie said it two tight line had appeared at the corner of her mouth she had been sitting silently beside me her coffee cup balanced on one knee i had lost the thread of conversation long ago when they quit talking about tom robinson s wife and had contented myself with thinking of finch s landing and the river aunt alexandra had got it backwards the business part of the meeting wa blood curdling the social hour wa dreary maudie i m sure i don t know what you mean said mr merriweather i m sure you do miss maudie said shortly she said no more when miss maudie wa angry her brevity wa icy something had made her deeply angry and her gray eye were a cold a her voice mr merriweather reddened glanced at me and looked away i could not see mr farrow aunt alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshment neatly engaging mr merriweather and mr gate in brisk conversation when she had them well on the road with mr perkins aunt alexandra stepped back she gave miss maudie a look of pure gratitude and i wondered at the world of woman miss maudie and aunt alexandra had never been especially close and here wa aunty silently thanking her for something for what i knew not i wa content to learn that aunt alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given there wa no doubt about it i must soon enter this world where on it surface fragrant lady rocked slowly fanned gently and drank cool water but i wa more at home in my father s world people like mr heck tate did not trap you with innocent question to make fun of you even jem wa not highly critical unless you said something stupid lady seemed to live in faint horror of men seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them but i liked them there wa something about them no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed no matter how undelectable they were there wa something about them that i instinctively liked they weren t hypocrite mr perkins born hypocrite mr merriweather wa saying at least we don t have that sin on our shoulder down here people up there set em free but you don t see em settin at the table with em at least we don t have the deceit to say to em yes you re a good a we are but stay away from u down here we just say you live your way and we ll live ours i think that woman that mr roosevelt s lost her mind just plain lost her mind coming down to birmingham and tryin to sit with em if i wa the mayor of birmingham i d well neither of u wa the mayor of birmingham but i wished i wa the governor of alabama for one day i d let tom robinson go so quick the missionary society wouldn t have time to catch it breath calpurnia wa telling miss rachel s cook the other day how bad tom wa taking thing and she didn t stop talking when i came into the kitchen she said there wasn t a thing atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him that the last thing he said to atticus before they took him down to the prison camp wa good bye mr finch there ain t nothin you can do now so there ain t no use tryin calpurnia said atticus told her that the day they took tom to prison he just gave up hope she said atticus tried to explain thing to him and that he must do his best not to lose hope because atticus wa doing his best to get him free miss rachel s cook asked calpurnia why didn t atticus just say yes you ll go free and leave it at that seemed like that d be a big comfort to tom calpurnia said because you ain t familiar with the law first thing you learn when you re in a lawin family is that there ain t any definite answer to anything mr finch couldn t say somethin s so when he doesn t know for sure it s so the front door slammed and i heard atticus s footstep in the hall automatically i wondered what time it wa not nearly time for him to be home and on missionary society day he usually stayed downtown until black dark he stopped in the doorway his hat wa in his hand and his face wa white excuse me lady he said go right ahead with your meeting don t let me disturb you alexandra could you come to the kitchen a minute i want to borrow calpurnia for a while he didn t go through the diningroom but went down the back hallway and entered the kitchen from the rear door aunt alexandra and i met him the diningroom door opened again and miss maudie joined u calpurnia had half risen from her chair cal atticus said i want you to go with me out to helen robinson s house what s the matter aunt alexandra asked alarmed by the look on my father s face tom s dead aunt alexandra put her hand to her mouth they shot him said atticus he wa running it wa during their exercise period they said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started climbing over right in front of them didn t they try to stop him didn t they give him any warning aunt alexandra s voice shook oh yes the guard called to him to stop they fired a few shot in the air then to kill they got him just a he went over the fence they said if he d had two good arm he d have made it he wa moving that fast seventeen bullet hole in him they didn t have to shoot him that much cal i want you to come out with me and help me tell helen yes sir she murmured fumbling at her apron miss maudie went to calpurnia and untied it this is the last straw atticus aunt alexandra said depends on how you look at it he said what wa one negro more or less among two hundred of em he wasn t tom to them he wa an escaping prisoner atticus leaned against the refrigerator pushed up his glass and rubbed his eye we had such a good chance he said i told him what i thought but i couldn t in truth say that we had more than a good chance i guess tom wa tired of white men s chance and preferred to take his own ready cal yessir mr finch then let s go aunt alexandra sat down in calpurnia s chair and put her hand to her face she sat quite still she wa so quiet i wondered if she would faint i heard miss maudie breathing a if she had just climbed the step and in the diningroom the lady chattered happily i thought aunt alexandra wa cry but when she took her hand away from her face she wa not she looked weary she spoke and her voice wa flat i can t say i approve of everything he doe maudie but he s my brother and i just want to know when this will ever end her voice rose it tear him to piece he doesn t show it much but it tear him to piece i ve seen him when what else do they want from him maudie what else what doe who want alexandra miss maudie asked i mean this town they re perfectly willing to let him do what they re too afraid to do themselves it might lose em a nickel they re perfectly willing to let him wreck his health doing what they re afraid to do they re be quiet they ll hear you said miss maudie have you ever thought of it this way alexandra whether maycomb know it or not we re paying the highest tribute we can pay a man we trust him to do right it s that simple who aunt alexandra never knew she wa echoing her twelve year old nephew the handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked white only the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody not just u the handful of people with enough humility to think when they look at a negro there but for the lord s kindness am l miss maudie s old crispness wa returning the handful of people in this town with background that s who they are had i been attentive i would have had another scrap to add to jem s definition of background but i found myself shaking and couldn t stop i had seen enfield prison farm and atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me it wa the size of a football field stop that shaking commanded miss maudie and i stopped get up alexandra we ve left em long enough aunt alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridge along her hip she took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose she patted her hair and said do i show it not a sign said miss maudie are you together again jean louise yes ma am then let s join the lady she said grimly their voice swelled when miss maudie opened the door to the diningroom aunt alexandra wa ahead of me and i saw her head go up a she went through the door oh mr perkins she said you need some more coffee let me get it calpurnia s on an errand for a few minute grace said miss maudie let me pas you some more of those dewberry tart dyou hear what that cousin of mine did the other day the one who like to go fishing and so they went down the row of laughing woman around the diningroom refilling coffee cup dishing out goody a though their only regret wa the temporary domestic disaster of losing calpurnia the gentle hum began again yes sir mr perkins that j grime everett is a martyred saint he needed to get married so they ran to the beauty parlor every saturday afternoon soon a the sun go down he go to bed with the chicken a crate full of sick chicken fred say that s what started it all fred say aunt alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled she looked at a tray of cooky on the table and nodded at them i carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to mr merriweather with my best company manner i asked her if she would have some after all if aunty could be a lady at a time like this so could i content prev next chapter don t do that scout set him out on the back step jem are you crazy i said set him out on the back step sighing i scooped up the small creature placed him on the bottom step and went back to my cot september had come but not a trace of cool weather with it and we were still sleeping on the back screen porch lightning bug were still about the night crawler and flying insect that beat against the screen the summer long had not gone wherever they go when autumn come a roly poly had found his way inside the house i reasoned that the tiny varmint had crawled up the step and under the door i wa putting my book on the floor beside my cot when i saw him the creature are no more than an inch long and when you touch them they roll themselves into a tight gray ball i lay on my stomach reached down and poked him he rolled up then feeling safe i suppose he slowly unrolled he traveled a few inch on his hundred leg and i touched him again he rolled up feeling sleepy i decided to end thing my hand wa going down on him when jem spoke jem wa scowling it wa probably a part of the stage he wa going through and i wished he would hurry up and get through it he wa certainly never cruel to animal but i had never known his charity to embrace the insect world why couldn t i mash him i asked because they don t bother you jem answered in the darkness he had turned out his reading light reckon you re at the stage now where you don t kill fly and mosquito now i reckon i said lem me know when you change your mind tell you one thing though i ain t gon na sit around and not scratch a redbug aw dry up he answered drowsily jem wa the one who wa getting more like a girl every day not i comfortable i lay on my back and waited for sleep and while waiting i thought of dill he had left u the first of the month with firm assurance that he would return the minute school wa out he guessed his folk had got the general idea that he liked to spend his summer in maycomb miss rachel took u with them in the taxi to maycomb junction and dill waved to u from the train window until he wa out of sight he wa not out of mind i missed him the last two day of his time with u jem had taught him to swim taught him to swim i wa wide awake remembering what dill had told me barker s eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the meridian highway about a mile from town it is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passing motorist and the short walk to the creek is easy but the prospect of walking all the way back home at dusk when the traffic is light is tiresome and swimmer are careful not to stay too late according to dill he and jem had just come to the highway when they saw atticus driving toward them he looked like he had not seen them so they both waved atticus finally slowed down when they caught up with him he said you d better catch a ride back i won t be going home for a while calpurnia wa in the back seat jem protested then pleaded and atticus said all right you can come with u if you stay in the car on the way to tom robinson s atticus told them what had happened they turned off the highway rode slowly by the dump and past the ewell residence down the narrow lane to the negro cabin dill said a crowd of black child were playing marble in tom s front yard atticus parked the car and got out calpurnia followed him through the front gate dill heard him ask one of the child where s your mother sam and heard sam say she down at si stevens s mr finch want me run fetch her dill said atticus looked uncertain then he said yes and sam scampered off go on with your game boy atticus said to the child a little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at atticus dill said her hair wa a wad of tiny stiff pigtail each ending in a bright bow she grinned from ear to ear and walked toward our father but she wa too small to navigate the step dill said atticus went to her took off his hat and offered her his finger she grabbed it and he eased her down the step then he gave her to calpurnia sam wa trotting behind his mother when they came up dill said helen said evenin mr finch won t you have a seat but she didn t say any more neither did atticus scout said dill she just fell down in the dirt just fell down in the dirt like a giant with a big foot just came along and stepped on her just ump dill s fat foot hit the ground like you d step on an ant dill said calpurnia and atticus lifted helen to her foot and half carried half walked her to the cabin they stayed inside a long time and atticus came out alone when they drove back by the dump some of the ewells hollered at them but dill didn t catch what they said maycomb wa interested by the news of tom s death for perhaps two day two day wa enough for the information to spread through the county did you hear about no well they say he wa runnin fit to beat lightnin to maycomb tom s death wa typical typical of a nigger to cut and run typical of a nigger s mentality to have no plan no thought for the future just run blind first chance he saw funny thing atticus finch might ve got him off scot free but wait hell no you know how they are easy come easy go just show you that robinson boy wa legally married they say he kept himself clean went to church and all that but when it come down to the line the veneer s mighty thin nigger always come out in em a few more detail enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn then nothing to talk about until the maycomb tribune appeared the following thursday there wa a brief obituary in the colored news but there wa also an editorial mr b b underwood wa at his most bitter and he couldn t have cared less who canceled advertising and subscription but maycomb didn t play that way mr underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to he d still get his advertising and subscription if he wanted to make a fool of himself in his paper that wa his business mr underwood didn t talk about miscarriage of justice he wa writing so child could understand mr underwood simply figured it wa a sin to kill cripple be they standing sitting or escaping he likened tom s death to the senseless slaughter of songbird by hunter and child and maycomb thought he wa trying to write an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted in the montgomery advertiser how could this be so i wondered a i read mr underwood s editorial senseless killing tom had been given due process of law to the day of his death he had been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true my father had fought for him all the way then mr underwood s meaning became clear atticus had used every tool available to free men to save tom robinson but in the secret court of men s heart atticus had no case tom wa a dead man the minute mayella ewell opened her mouth and screamed the name ewell gave me a queasy feeling maycomb had lost no time in getting mr ewell s view on tom s demise and passing them along through that english channel of gossip miss stephanie crawford miss stephanie told aunt alexandra in jem s presence oh foot he s old enough to listen that mr ewell said it made one down and about two more to go jem told me not to be afraid mr ewell wa more hot gas than anything jem also told me that if i breathed a word to atticus if in any way i let atticus know i knew jem would personally never speak to me again content prev next chapter school started and so did our daily trip past the radley place jem wa in the seventh grade and went to high school beyond the grammar school building i wa now in the third grade and our routine were so different i only walked to school with jem in the morning and saw him at mealtime he went out for football but wa too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team water bucket this he did with enthusiasm most afternoon he wa seldom home before dark the radley place had ceased to terrify me but it wa no less gloomy no less chilly under it great oak and no less uninviting mr nathan radley could still be seen on a clear day walking to and from town we knew boo wa there for the same old reason nobody d seen him carried out yet i sometimes felt a twinge of remorse when passing by the old place at ever having taken part in what must have been sheer torment to arthur radley what reasonable recluse want child peeping through his shutter delivering greeting on the end of a fishingpole wandering in his collard at night and yet i remembered two indian head penny chewing gum soap doll a rusty medal a broken watch and chain jem must have put them away somewhere i stopped and looked at the tree one afternoon the trunk wa swelling around it cement patch the patch itself wa turning yellow we had almost seen him a couple of time a good enough score for anybody but i still looked for him each time i went by maybe someday we would see him i imagined how it would be when it happened he d just be sitting in the swing when i came along hidy do mr arthur i would say a if i had said it every afternoon of my life evening jean louise he would say a if he had said it every afternoon of my life right pretty spell we re having isn t it yes sir right pretty i would say and go on it wa only a fantasy we would never see him he probably did go out when the moon wa down and gaze upon miss stephanie crawford i d have picked somebody else to look at but that wa his business he would never gaze at u you aren t starting that again are you said atticus one night when i expressed a stray desire just to have one good look at boo radley before i died if you are i ll tell you right now stop it i m too old to go chasing you off the radley property besides it s dangerous you might get shot you know mr nathan shoot at every shadow he see even shadow that leave size four bare footprint you were lucky not to be killed i hushed then and there at the same time i marveled at atticus this wa the first he had let u know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew and it had happened year ago no only last summer no summer before last when time wa playing trick on me i must remember to ask jem so many thing had happened to u boo radley wa the least of our fear atticus said he didn t see how anything else could happen that thing had a way of settling down and after enough time passed people would forget that tom robinson s existence wa ever brought to their attention perhaps atticus wa right but the event of the summer hung over u like smoke in a closed room the adult in maycomb never discussed the case with jem and me it seemed that they discussed it with their child and their attitude must have been that neither of u could help having atticus for a parent so their child must be nice to u in spite of him the child would never have thought that up for themselves had our classmate been left to their own device jem and i would have had several swift satisfying fist fight apiece and ended the matter for good a it wa we were compelled to hold our head high and be respectively a gentleman and a lady in a way it wa like the era of mr henry lafayette dubose without all her yelling there wa one odd thing though that i never understood in spite of atticus s shortcoming a a parent people were content to re elect him to the state legislature that year a usual without opposition i came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar i withdrew from them and never thought about them until i wa forced to i wa forced to one day in school once a week we had a current event period each child wa supposed to clip an item from a newspaper absorb it content and reveal them to the class this practice allegedly overcame a variety of evil standing in front of his fellow encouraged good posture and gave a child poise delivering a short talk made him word conscious learning his current event strengthened his memory being singled out made him more than ever anxious to return to the group the idea wa profound but a usual in maycomb it didn t work very well in the first place few rural child had access to newspaper so the burden of current event wa borne by the town child convincing the bus child more deeply that the town child got all the attention anyway the rural child who could usually brought clipping from what they called the grit paper a publication spurious in the eye of miss gate our teacher why she frowned when a child recited from the grit paper i never knew but in some way it wa associated with liking fiddling eating syrupy biscuit for lunch being a holy roller singing sweetly sings the donkey and pronouncing it dunkey all of which the state paid teacher to discourage even so not many of the child knew what a current event wa little chuck little a hundred year old in his knowledge of cow and their habit wa halfway through an uncle natchell story when miss gate stopped him charles that is not a current event that is an advertisement cecil jacob knew what one wa though when his turn came he went to the front of the room and began old hitler adolf hitler cecil said miss gate one never begin with old anybody yes ma am he said old adolf hitler ha been prosecutin the persecuting cecil nome miss gate it say here well anyway old adolf hitler ha been after the jew and he s puttin em in prison and he s taking away all their property and he won t let any of em out of the country and he s washin all the feebleminded and washing the feeble minded yes ma am miss gate i reckon they don t have sense enough to wash themselves i don t reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean well anyway hitler s started a program to round up all the half jew too and he want to register em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and i think this is a bad thing and that s my current event very good cecil said miss gate puffing cecil returned to his seat a hand went up in the back of the room how can he do that who do what asked miss gate patiently i mean how can hitler just put a lot of folk in a pen like that look like the govamint d stop him said the owner of the hand hitler is the government said miss gate and seizing an opportunity to make education dynamic she went to the blackboard she printed democracy in large letter democracy she said doe anybody have a definition u somebody said i raised my hand remembering an old campaign slogan atticus had once told me about what do you think it mean jean louise equal right for all special privilege for none i quoted very good jean louise very good miss gate smiled in front of democracy she printed we are a now class say it all together we are a democracy we said it then miss gate said that s the difference between america and germany we are a democracy and germany is a dictatorship dictator ship she said over here we don t believe in persecuting anybody persecution come from people who are prejudiced prejudice she enunciated carefully there are no better people in the world than the jew and why hitler doesn t think so is a mystery to me an inquiring soul in the middle of the room said why don t they like the jew you reckon miss gate i don t know henry they contribute to every society they live in and most of all they are a deeply religious people hitler s trying to do away with religion so maybe he doesn t like them for that reason cecil spoke up well i don t know for certain he said they re supposed to change money or somethin but that ain t no cause to persecute em they re white ain t they miss gate said when you get to high school cecil you ll learn that the jew have been persecuted since the beginning of history even driven out of their own country it s one of the most terrible story in history time for arithmetic child a i had never liked arithmetic i spent the period looking out the window the only time i ever saw atticus scowl wa when elmer davis would give u the latest on hitler atticus would snap off the radio and say hmp i asked him once why he wa impatient with hitler and atticus said because he s a maniac this would not do i mused a the class proceeded with it sum one maniac and million of german folk looked to me like they d shut hitler in a pen instead of letting him shut them up there wa something else wrong i would ask my father about it i did and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didn t know the answer but it s okay to hate hitler it is not he said it s not okay to hate anybody atticus i said there s somethin i don t understand miss gate said it wa awful hitler doin like he doe she got real red in the face about it i should think she would but yes nothing sir i went away not sure that i could explain to atticus what wa on my mind not sure that i could clarify what wa only a feeling perhaps jem could provide the answer jem understood school thing better than atticus jem wa worn out from a day s water carrying there were at least twelve banana peel on the floor by his bed surrounding an empty milk bottle whatcha stuffin for i asked coach say if i can gain twenty five pound by year after next i can play he said this is the quickest way if you don t throw it all up jem i said i wanta ask you somethin shoot he put down his book and stretched his leg miss gate is a nice lady ain t she why sure said jem i liked her when i wa in her room she hate hitler a lot what s wrong with that well she went on today about how bad it wa him treatin the jew like that jem it s not right to persecute anybody is it i mean have mean thought about anybody even is it gracious no scout what s eatin you well coming out of the courthouse that night miss gate wa she wa goin down the step in front of u you musta not seen her she wa talking with miss stephanie crawford i heard her say it s time somebody taught em a lesson they were gettin way above themselves an the next thing they think they can do is marry u jem how can you hate hitler so bad an then turn around and be ugly about folk right at home jem wa suddenly furious he leaped off the bed grabbed me by the collar and shook me i never wanta hear about that courthouse again ever ever you hear me you hear me don t you ever say one word to me about it again you hear now go on i wa too surprised to cry i crept from jem s room and shut the door softly lest undue noise set him off again suddenly tired i wanted atticus he wa in the livingroom and i went to him and tried to get in his lap atticus smiled you re getting so big now i ll just have to hold a part of you he held me close scout he said softly don t let jem get you down he s having a rough time these day i heard you back there atticus said that jem wa trying hard to forget something but what he wa really doing wa storing it away for a while until enough time passed then he would be able to think about it and sort thing out when he wa able to think about it jem would be himself again content prev next chapter thing did settle down after a fashion a atticus said they would by the middle of october only two small thing out of the ordinary happened to two maycomb citizen no there were three thing and they did not directly concern u the finch but in a way they did the first thing wa that mr bob ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of day and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteen thirty he wa the only man i ever heard of who wa fired from the wpa for laziness i suppose his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry but his job lasted only a long a his notoriety mr ewell found himself a forgotten a tom robinson thereafter he resumed his regular weekly appearance at the welfare office for his check and received it with no grace amid obscure muttering that the bastard who thought they ran this town wouldn t permit an honest man to make a living ruth jones the welfare lady said mr ewell openly accused atticus of getting his job she wa upset enough to walk down to atticus s office and tell him about it atticus told miss ruth not to fret that if bob ewell wanted to discus atticus s getting his job he knew the way to the office the second thing happened to judge taylor judge taylor wa not a sunday night churchgoer mr taylor wa judge taylor savored his sunday night hour alone in his big house and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the writing of bob taylor no kin but the judge would have been proud to claim it one sunday night lost in fruity metaphor and florid diction judge taylor s attention wa wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise hush he said to ann taylor his fat nondescript dog then he realized he wa speaking to an empty room the scratching noise wa coming from the rear of the house judge taylor clumped to the back porch to let ann out and found the screen door swinging open a shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye and that wa all he saw of his visitor mr taylor came home from church to find her husband in his chair lost in the writing of bob taylor with a shotgun across his lap the third thing happened to helen robinson tom s widow if mr ewell wa a forgotten a tom robinson tom robinson wa a forgotten a boo radley but tom wa not forgotten by his employer mr link dea mr link dea made a job for helen he didn t really need her but he said he felt right bad about the way thing turned out i never knew who took care of her child while helen wa away calpurnia said it wa hard on helen because she had to walk nearly a mile out of her way to avoid the ewells who according to helen chunked at her the first time she tried to use the public road mr link dea eventually received the impression that helen wa coming to work each morning from the wrong direction and dragged the reason out of her just let it be mr link please suh helen begged the hell i will said mr link he told her to come by his store that afternoon before she left she did and mr link closed his store put his hat firmly on his head and walked helen home he walked her the short way by the ewells on his way back mr link stopped at the crazy gate ewell he called i say ewell the window normally packed with child were empty i know every last one of you s in there a layin on the floor now hear me bob ewell if i hear one more peep outa my girl helen about not bein able to walk this road i ll have you in jail before sundown mr link spat in the dust and walked home helen went to work next morning and used the public road nobody chunked at her but when she wa a few yard beyond the ewell house she looked around and saw mr ewell walking behind her she turned and walked on and mr ewell kept the same distance behind her until she reached mr link dea s house all the way to the house helen said she heard a soft voice behind her crooning foul word thoroughly frightened she telephoned mr link at his store which wa not too far from his house a mr link came out of his store he saw mr ewell leaning on the fence mr ewell said don t you look at me link dea like i wa dirt i ain t jumped your first thing you can do ewell is get your stinkin carcass off my property you re leanin on it an i can t afford fresh paint for it second thing you can do is stay away from my cook or i ll have you up for assault i ain t touched her link dea and ain t about to go with no nigger you don t have to touch her all you have to do is make her afraid an if assault ain t enough to keep you locked up awhile i ll get you in on the lady law so get outa my sight if you don t think i mean it just bother that girl again mr ewell evidently thought he meant it for helen reported no further trouble i don t like it atticus i don t like it at all wa aunt alexandra s assessment of these event that man seems to have a permanent running grudge against everybody connected with that case i know how that kind are about paying off grudge but i don t understand why he should harbor one he had his way in court didn t he i think i understand said atticus it might be because he know in his heart that very few people in maycomb really believed his and mayella s yarn he thought he d be a hero but all he got for his pain wa wa okay we ll convict this negro but get back to your dump he s had his fling with about everybody now so he ought to be satisfied he ll settle down when the weather change but why should he try to burgle john taylor s house he obviously didn t know john wa home or he wouldn t ve tried only light john show on sunday night are on the front porch and back in his den you don t know if bob ewell cut that screen you don t know who did it said atticus but i can guess i proved him a liar but john made him look like a fool all the time ewell wa on the stand i couldn t dare look at john and keep a straight face john looked at him a if he were a three legged chicken or a square egg don t tell me judge don t try to prejudice jury atticus chuckled by the end of october our life had become the familiar routine of school play study jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it wa he wanted to forget and our classmate mercifully let u forget our father s eccentricity cecil jacob asked me one time if atticus wa a radical when i asked atticus atticus wa so amused i wa rather annoyed but he said he wasn t laughing at me he said you tell cecil i m about a radical a cotton tom heflin aunt alexandra wa thriving miss maudie must have silenced the whole missionary society at one blow for aunty again ruled that roost her refreshment grew even more delicious i learned more about the poor mrunas social life from listening to mr merriweather they had so little sense of family that the whole tribe wa one big family a child had a many father a there were men in the community a many mother a there were woman j grime everett wa doing his utmost to change this state of affair and desperately needed our prayer maycomb wa itself again precisely the same a last year and the year before that with only two minor change firstly people had removed from their store window and automobile the sticker that said nra we do our part i asked atticus why and he said it wa because the national recovery act wa dead i asked who killed it he said nine old men the second change in maycomb since last year wa not one of national significance until then halloween in maycomb wa a completely unorganized affair each child did what he wanted to do with assistance from other child if there wa anything to be moved such a placing a light buggy on top of the livery stable but parent thought thing went too far last year when the peace of miss tutti and miss frutti wa shattered miss tutti and frutti barber were maiden lady sister who lived together in the only maycomb residence boasting a cellar the barber lady were rumored to be republican having migrated from clanton alabama in their way were strange to u and why they wanted a cellar nobody knew but they wanted one and they dug one and they spent the rest of their life chasing generation of child out of it miss tutti and frutti their name were sarah and france aside from their yankee way were both deaf miss tutti denied it and lived in a world of silence but miss frutti not about to miss anything employed an ear trumpet so enormous that jem declared it wa a loudspeaker from one of those dog victrola with these fact in mind and halloween at hand some wicked child had waited until the miss barber were thoroughly asleep slipped into their livingroom nobody but the radleys locked up at night stealthily made away with every stick of furniture therein and hid it in the cellar i deny having taken part in such a thing i heard em wa the cry that awoke the miss barber s neighbor at dawn next morning heard em drive a truck up to the door stomped around like horse they re in new orleans by now miss tutti wa sure those traveling fur seller who came through town two day ago had purloined their furniture da rk they were she said syrian mr heck tate wa summoned he surveyed the area and said he thought it wa a local job miss frutti said she d know a maycomb voice anywhere and there were no maycomb voice in that parlor last night rolling their r s all over her premise they were nothing less than the bloodhound must be used to locate their furniture miss tutti insisted so mr tate wa obliged to go ten mile out the road round up the county hound and put them on the trail mr tate started them off at the miss barber s front step but all they did wa run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door when mr tate set them in motion three time he finally guessed the truth by noontime that day there wa not a barefooted child to be seen in maycomb and nobody took off his shoe until the hound were returned so the maycomb lady said thing would be different this year the high school auditorium would be open there would be a pageant for the grown ups applebobbing taffy pulling pinning the tail on the donkey for the child there would also be a prize of twenty five cent for the best halloween costume created by the wearer jem and i both groaned not that we d ever done anything it wa the principle of the thing jem considered himself too old for halloween anyway he said he wouldn t be caught anywhere near the high school at something like that oh well i thought atticus would take me i soon learned however that my service would be required on stage that evening mr grace merriweather had composed an original pageant entitled maycomb county ad astra per aspera and i wa to be a ham she thought it would be adorable if some of the child were costumed to represent the county s agricultural product cecil jacob would be dressed up to look like a cow agnes boone would make a lovely butterbean another child would be a peanut and on down the line until mr merriweather s imagination and the supply of child were exhausted our only duty a far a i could gather from our two rehearsal were to enter from stage left a mr merriweather not only the author but the narrator identified u when she called out pork that wa my cue then the assembled company would sing maycomb county maycomb county we will aye be true to thee a the grand finale and mr merriweather would mount the stage with the state flag my costume wa not much of a problem mr crenshaw the local seamstress had a much imagination a mr merriweather mr crenshaw took some chicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham this she covered with brown cloth and painted it to resemble the original i could duck under and someone would pull the contraption down over my head it came almost to my knee mr crenshaw thoughtfully left two peephole for me she did a fine job jem said i looked exactly like a ham with leg there were several discomfort though it wa hot it wa a close fit if my nose itched i couldn t scratch and once inside i could not get out of it alone when halloween came i assumed that the whole family would be present to watch me perform but i wa disappointed atticus said a tactfully a he could that he just didn t think he could stand a pageant tonight he wa all in he had been in montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon he thought jem might escort me if i asked him aunt alexandra said she just had to get to bed early she d been decorating the stage all afternoon and wa worn out she stopped short in the middle of her sentence she closed her mouth then opened it to say something but no word came s matter aunty i asked oh nothing nothing she said somebody just walked over my grave she put away from her whatever it wa that gave her a pinprick of apprehension and suggested that i give the family a preview in the livingroom so jem squeezed me into my costume stood at the livingroom door called out po ork exactly a mr merriweather would have done and i marched in atticus and aunt alexandra were delighted i repeated my part for calpurnia in the kitchen and she said i wa wonderful i wanted to go across the street to show miss maudie but jem said she d probably be at the pageant anyway after that it didn t matter whether they went or not jem said he would take me thus began our longest journey together content prev next chapter the weather wa unusually warm for the last day of october we didn t even need jacket the wind wa growing stronger and jem said it might be raining before we got home there wa no moon the street light on the corner cast sharp shadow on the radley house i heard jem laugh softly bet nobody bother them tonight he said jem wa carrying my ham costume rather awkwardly a it wa hard to hold i thought it gallant of him to do so it is a scary place though ain t it i said boo doesn t mean anybody any harm but i m right glad you re along you know atticus wouldn t let you go to the schoolhouse by yourself jem said don t see why it s just around the corner and across the yard that yard s a mighty long place for little girl to cross at night jem teased ain t you scared of haints we laughed haints hot steam incantation secret sign had vanished with our year a mist with sunrise what wa that old thing jem said angel bright life in death get off the road don t suck my breath cut it out now i said we were in front of the radley place jem said boo must not be at home listen high above u in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in blissful unawareness of whose tree he sat in plunging from the shrill kee kee of the sunflower bird to the irascible qua ack of a bluejay to the sad lament of poor will poor will poor will we turned the corner and i tripped on a root growing in the road jem tried to help me but all he did wa drop my costume in the dust i didn t fall though and soon we were on our way again we turned off the road and entered the schoolyard it wa pitch black how do you know where we re at jem i asked when we had gone a few step i can tell we re under the big oak because we re passin through a cool spot careful now and don t fall again we had slowed to a cautious gait and were feeling our way forward so a not to bump into the tree the tree wa a single and ancient oak two child could not reach around it trunk and touch hand it wa far away from teacher their spy and curious neighbor it wa near the radley lot but the radleys were not curious a small patch of earth beneath it branch wa packed hard from many fight and furtive crap game the light in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance but they blinded u if anything don t look ahead scout jem said look at the ground and you won t fall you should have brought the flashlight jem didn t know it wa this dark didn t look like it d be this dark earlier in the evening so cloudy that s why it ll hold off a while though someone leaped at u god almighty jem yelled a circle of light burst in our face and cecil jacob jumped in glee behind it haa a gotcha he shrieked thought you d be comin along this way what are you doin way out here by yourself boy ain t you scared of boo radley cecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parent hadn t seen u then had ventured down this far because he knew good and well we d be coming along he thought mr finch d be with u though shuck ain t much but around the corner said jem who s scared to go around the corner we had to admit that cecil wa pretty good though he had given u a fright and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse that wa his privilege say i said ain t you a cow tonight where s your costume it s up behind the stage he said mr merriweather say the pageant ain t comin on for a while you can put yours back of the stage by mine scout and we can go with the rest of em this wa an excellent idea jem thought he also thought it a good thing that cecil and i would be together this way jem would be left to go with people his own age when we reached the auditorium the whole town wa there except atticus and the lady worn out from decorating and the usual outcast and shut in most of the county it seemed wa there the hall wa teeming with slicked up country people the high school building had a wide downstairs hallway people milled around booth that had been installed along each side oh jem i forgot my money i sighed when i saw them atticus didn t jem said here s thirty cent you can do six thing see you later on okay i said quite content with thirty cent and cecil i went with cecil down to the front of the auditorium through a door on one side and backstage i got rid of my ham costume and departed in a hurry for mr merriweather wa standing at a lectern in front of the first row of seat making last minute frenzied change in the script how much money you got i asked cecil cecil had thirty cent too which made u even we squandered our first nickel on the house of horror which scared u not at all we entered the black seventh grade room and were led around by the temporary ghoul in residence and were made to touch several object alleged to be component part of a human being here s his eye we were told when we touched two peeled grape on a saucer here s his heart which felt like raw liver these are his innards and our hand were thrust into a plate of cold spaghetti cecil and i visited several booth we each bought a sack of mr judge taylor s homemade divinity i wanted to bob for apple but cecil said it wasn t sanitary his mother said he might catch something from everybody s head having been in the same tub ain t anything around town now to catch i protested but cecil said his mother said it wa unsanitary to eat after folk i later asked aunt alexandra about this and she said people who held such view were usually climber we were about to purchase a blob of taffy when mr merriweather s runner appeared and told u to go backstage it wa time to get ready the auditorium wa filling with people the maycomb county high school band had assembled in front below the stage the stage footlights were on and the red velvet curtain rippled and billowed from the scurrying going on behind it backstage cecil and i found the narrow hallway teeming with people adult in homemade three corner hat confederate cap spanish american war hat and world war helmet child dressed a various agricultural enterprise crowded around the one small window somebody s mashed my costume i wailed in dismay mr merriweather galloped to me reshaped the chicken wire and thrust me inside you all right in there scout asked cecil you sound so far off like you wa on the other side of a hill you don t sound any nearer i said the band played the national anthem and we heard the audience rise then the bass drum sounded mr merriweather stationed behind her lectern beside the band said maycomb county ad astra per aspera the bass drum boomed again that mean said mr merriweather translating for the rustic element from the mud to the star she added unnecessarily it seemed to me a pageant reckon they wouldn t know what it wa if she didn t tell em whispered cecil who wa immediately shushed the whole town know it i breathed but the country folk ve come in cecil said be quiet back there a man s voice ordered and we were silent the bass drum went boom with every sentence mr merriweather uttered she chanted mournfully about maycomb county being older than the state that it wa a part of the mississippi and alabama territory that the first white man to set foot in the virgin forest wa the probate judge s great grandfather five time removed who wa never heard of again then came the fearless colonel maycomb for whom the county wa named andrew jackson appointed him to a position of authority and colonel maycomb s misplaced self confidence and slender sense of direction brought disaster to all who rode with him in the creek indian war colonel maycomb persevered in his effort to make the region safe for democracy but his first campaign wa his last his order relayed to him by a friendly indian runner were to move south after consulting a tree to ascertain from it lichen which way wa south and taking no lip from the subordinate who ventured to correct him colonel maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to rout the enemy and entangled his troop so far northwest in the forest primeval that they were eventually rescued by settler moving inland mr merriweather gave a thirty minute description of colonel maycomb s exploit i discovered that if i bent my knee i could tuck them under my costume and more or less sit i sat down listened to mr merriweather s drone and the bass drum s boom and wa soon fast asleep they said later that mr merriweather wa putting her all into the grand finale that she had crooned po ork with a confidence born of pine tree and butterbean entering on cue she waited a few second then called po ork when nothing materialized she yelled pork i must have heard her in my sleep or the band playing dixie woke me but it wa when mr merriweather triumphantly mounted the stage with the state flag that i chose to make my entrance chose is incorrect i thought i d better catch up with the rest of them they told me later that judge taylor went out behind the auditorium and stood there slapping his knee so hard mr taylor brought him a glass of water and one of his pill mr merriweather seemed to have a hit everybody wa cheering so but she caught me backstage and told me i had ruined her pageant she made me feel awful but when jem came to fetch me he wa sympathetic he said he couldn t see my costume much from where he wa sitting how he could tell i wa feeling bad under my costume i don t know but he said i did all right i just came in a little late that wa all jem wa becoming almost a good a atticus at making you feel right when thing went wrong almost not even jem could make me go through that crowd and he consented to wait backstage with me until the audience left you wanta take it off scout he asked naw i ll just keep it on i said i could hide my mortification under it you all want a ride home someone asked no sir thank you i heard jem say it s just a little walk be careful of haints the voice said better still tell the haints to be careful of scout there aren t many folk left now jem told me let s go we went through the auditorium to the hallway then down the step it wa still black dark the remaining car were parked on the other side of the building and their headlight were little help if some of em were goin in our direction we could see better said jem here scout let me hold onto your hock you might lose your balance i can see all right yeah but you might lose your balance i felt a slight pressure on my head and assumed that jem had grabbed that end of the ham you got me uh huh we began crossing the black schoolyard straining to see our foot jem i said i forgot my shoe they re back behind the stage well let s go get em but a we turned around the auditorium light went off you can get em tomorrow he said but tomorrow s sunday i protested a jem turned me homeward you can get the janitor to let you in scout hm nothing jem hadn t started that in a long time i wondered what he wa thinking he d tell me when he wanted to probably when we got home i felt his finger press the top of my costume too hard it seemed i shook my head jem you don t hafta hush a minute scout he said pinching me we walked along silently minute s up i said whatcha thinkin about i turned to look at him but his outline wa barely visible thought i heard something he said stop a minute we stopped hear anything he asked no we had not gone five pace before he made me stop again jem are you tryin to scare me you know i m too old be quiet he said and i knew he wa not joking the night wa still i could hear his breath coming easily beside me occasionally there wa a sudden breeze that hit my bare leg but it wa all that remained of a promised windy night this wa the stillness before a thunderstorm we listened heard an old dog just then i said it s not that jem answered i hear it when we re walkin along but when we stop i don t hear it you hear my costume rustlin aw it s just halloween got you i said it more to convince myself than jem for sure enough a we began walking i heard what he wa talking about it wa not my costume it s just old cecil said jem presently he won t get u again let s don t let him think we re hurrying we slowed to a crawl i asked jem how cecil could follow u in this dark looked to me like he d bump into u from behind i can see you scout jem said how i can t see you your fat streak are showin mr crenshaw painted em with some of that shiny stuff so they d show up under the footlights i can see you pretty well an i expect cecil can see you well enough to keep his distance i would show cecil that we knew he wa behind u and we were ready for him cecil jacob is a big wet he en i yelled suddenly turning around we stopped there wa no acknowledgement save he en bouncing off the distant schoolhouse wall i ll get him said jem he y hay e hay e hay ey answered the schoolhouse wall it wa unlike cecil to hold out for so long once he pulled a joke he d repeat it time and again we should have been leapt at already jem signaled for me to stop again he said softly scout can you take that thing off i think so but i ain t got anything on under it much i ve got your dress here i can t get it on in the dark okay he said never mind jem are you afraid no think we re almost to the tree now few yard from that an we ll be to the road we can see the street light then jem wa talking in an unhurried flat toneless voice i wondered how long he would try to keep the cecil myth going you reckon we oughta sing jem no be real quiet again scout we had not increased our pace jem knew a well a i that it wa difficult to walk fast without stumping a toe tripping on stone and other inconvenience and i wa barefooted maybe it wa the wind rustling the tree but there wasn t any wind and there weren t any tree except the big oak our company shuffled and dragged his foot a if wearing heavy shoe whoever it wa wore thick cotton pant what i thought were tree rustling wa the soft swish of cotton on cotton wheek wheek with every step i felt the sand go cold under my foot and i knew we were near the big oak jem pressed my head we stopped and listened shuffle foot had not stopped with u this time his trouser swished softly and steadily then they stopped he wa running running toward u with no child s step run scout run run jem screamed i took one giant step and found myself reeling my arm useless in the dark i could not keep my balance jem jem help me jem something crushed the chicken wire around me metal ripped on metal and i fell to the ground and rolled a far a i could floundering to escape my wire prison from somewhere near by came scuffling kicking sound sound of shoe and flesh scraping dirt and root someone rolled against me and i felt jem he wa up like lightning and pulling me with him but though my head and shoulder were free i wa so entangled we didn t get very far we were nearly to the road when i felt jem s hand leave me felt him jerk backwards to the ground more scuffling and there came a dull crunching sound and jem screamed i ran in the direction of jem s scream and sank into a flabby male stomach it owner said uff and tried to catch my arm but they were tightly pinioned his stomach wa soft but his arm were like steel he slowly squeezed the breath out of me i could not move suddenly he wa jerked backwards and flung on the ground almost carrying me with him i thought jem s up one s mind work very slowly at time stunned i stood there dumbly the scuffling noise were dying someone wheezed and the night wa still again still but for a man breathing heavily breathing heavily and staggering i thought he went to the tree and leaned against it he coughed violently a sobbing boneshaking cough jem there wa no answer but the man s heavy breathing jem jem didn t answer the man began moving around a if searching for something i heard him groan and pull something heavy along the ground it wa slowly coming to me that there were now four people under the tree atticus the man wa walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road i went to where i thought he had been and felt frantically along the ground reaching out with my toe presently i touched someone jem my toe touched trouser a belt buckle button something i could not identify a collar and a face a prickly stubble on the face told me it wa not jem s i smelled stale whiskey i made my way along in what i thought wa the direction of the road i wa not sure because i had been turned around so many time but i found it and looked down to the street light a man wa passing under it the man wa walking with the staccato step of someone carrying a load too heavy for him he wa going around the corner he wa carrying jem jem s arm wa dangling crazily in front of him by the time i reached the corner the man wa crossing our front yard light from our front door framed atticus for an instant he ran down the step and together he and the man took jem inside i wa at the front door when they were going down the hall aunt alexandra wa running to meet me call dr reynolds atticus s voice came sharply from jem s room where s scout here she is aunt alexandra called pulling me along with her to the telephone she tugged at me anxiously i m all right aunty i said you better call she pulled the receiver from the hook and said eula may get dr reynolds quick agnes is your father home oh god where is he please tell him to come over here a soon a he come in please it s urgent there wa no need for aunt alexandra to identify herself people in maycomb knew each other s voice atticus came out of jem s room the moment aunt alexandra broke the connection atticus took the receiver from her he rattled the hook then said eula may get me the sheriff please heck atticus finch someone s been after my child jem s hurt between here and the schoolhouse i can t leave my boy run out there for me please and see if he s still around doubt if you ll find him now but i d like to see him if you do got to go now thanks heck atticus is jem dead no scout look after her sister he called a he went down the hall aunt alexandra s finger trembled a she unwound the crushed fabric and wire from around me are you all right darling she asked over and over a she worked me free it wa a relief to be out my arm were beginning to tingle and they were red with small hexagonal mark i rubbed them and they felt better aunty is jem dead no no darling he s unconscious we won t know how badly he s hurt until dr reynolds get here jean louise what happened i don t know she left it at that she brought me something to put on and had i thought about it then i would have never let her forget it in her distraction aunty brought me my overall put these on darling she said handing me the garment she most despised she rushed back to jem s room then came to me in the hall she patted me vaguely and went back to jem s room a car stopped in front of the house i knew dr reynolds s step almost a well a my father s he had brought jem and me into the world had led u through every childhood disease known to man including the time jem fell out of the treehouse and he had never lost our friendship dr reynolds said if we had been boil prone thing would have been different but we doubted it he came in the door and said good lord he walked toward me said you re still standing and changed his course he knew every room in the house he also knew that if i wa in bad shape so wa jem after ten forevers dr reynolds returned is jem dead i asked far from it he said squatting down to me he s got a bump on the head just like yours and a broken arm scout look that way no don t turn your head roll your eye now look over yonder he s got a bad break so far a i can tell now it s in the elbow like somebody tried to wring his arm off now look at me then he s not dead no o dr reynolds got to his foot we can t do much tonight he said except try to make him a comfortable a we can we ll have to x ray his arm look like he ll be wearing his arm way out by his side for a while don t worry though he ll be a good a new boy his age bounce while he wa talking dr reynolds had been looking keenly at me lightly fingering the bump that wa coming on my forehead you don t feel broke anywhere do you dr reynolds s small joke made me smile then you don t think he s dead then he put on his hat now i may be wrong of course but i think he s very alive show all the symptom of it go have a look at him and when i come back we ll get together and decide dr reynolds s step wa young and brisk mr heck tate s wa not his heavy boot punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly but he said the same thing dr reynolds said when he came in you all right scout he added yes sir i m goin in to see jem atticus n them s in there i ll go with you said mr tate aunt alexandra had shaded jem s reading light with a towel and his room wa dim jem wa lying on his back there wa an ugly mark along one side of his face his left arm lay out from his body his elbow wa bent slightly but in the wrong direction jem wa frowning jem atticus spoke he can t hear you scout he s out like a light he wa coming around but dr reynolds put him out again yes sir i retreated jem s room wa large and square aunt alexandra wa sitting in a rocking chair by the fireplace the man who brought jem in wa standing in a corner leaning against the wall he wa some countryman i did not know he had probably been at the pageant and wa in the vicinity when it happened he must have heard our scream and come running atticus wa standing by jem s bed mr heck tate stood in the doorway his hat wa in his hand and a flashlight bulged from his pant pocket he wa in his working clothes come in heck said atticus did you find anything i can t conceive of anyone low down enough to do a thing like this but i hope you found him mr tate sniffed he glanced sharply at the man in the corner nodded to him then looked around the room at jem at aunt alexandra then at atticus sit down mr finch he said pleasantly atticus said let s all sit down have that chair heck i ll get another one from the livingroom mr tate sat in jem s desk chair he waited until atticus returned and settled himself i wondered why atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the corner but atticus knew the way of country people far better than i some of his rural client would park their long eared steed under the chinaberry tree in the back yard and atticus would often keep appointment on the back step this one wa probably more comfortable where he wa mr finch said mr tate tell you what i found i found a little girl s dress it s out there in my car that your dress scout yes sir if it s a pink one with smockin i said mr tate wa behaving a if he were on the witness stand he liked to tell thing his own way untrammeled by state or defense and sometimes it took him a while i found some funny looking piece of muddy colored cloth that s m costume mr tate mr tate ran his hand down his thigh he rubbed his left arm and investigated jem s mantelpiece then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace his finger sought his long nose what is it heck said atticus mr tate found his neck and rubbed it bob ewell s lyin on the ground under that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his rib he s dead mr finch content prev next chapter aunt alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece mr tate rose but she declined assistance for once in his life atticus s instinctive courtesy failed him he sat where he wa somehow i could think of nothing but mr bob ewell saying he d get atticus if it took him the rest of his life mr ewell almost got him and it wa the last thing he did are you sure atticus said bleakly he s dead all right said mr tate he s good and dead he won t hurt these child again i didn t mean that atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep his age wa beginning to show his one sign of inner turmoil the strong line of his jaw melted a little one became aware of telltale crease forming under his ear one noticed not his jet black hair but the gray patch growing at his temple hadn t we better go to the livingroom aunt alexandra said at last if you don t mind said mr tate i d rather u stay in here if it won t hurt jem any i want to have a look at his injury while scout tell u about it is it all right if i leave she asked i m just one person too many in here i ll be in my room if you want me atticus aunt alexandra went to the door but she stopped and turned atticus i had a feeling about this tonight i this is my fault she began i should have mr tate held up his hand you go ahead miss alexandra i know it s been a shock to you and don t you fret yourself about anything why if we followed our feeling all the time we d be like cat chasin their tail miss scout see if you can tell u what happened while it s still fresh in your mind you think you can did you see him following you i went to atticus and felt his arm go around me i buried my head in his lap we started home i said jem i ve forgot m shoe soon s we started back for em the light went out jem said i could get em tomorrow scout raise up so mr tate can hear you atticus said i crawled into his lap then jem said hush a minute i thought he wa thinkin he always want you to hush so he can think then he said he heard somethin we thought it wa cecil cecil cecil jacob he scared u once tonight an we thought it wa him again he had on a sheet they gave a quarter for the best costume i don t know who won it where were you when you thought it wa cecil just a little piece from the schoolhouse i yelled somethin at him you yelled what cecil jacob is a big fat hen i think we didn t hear nothin then jem yelled hello or somethin loud enough to wake the dead just a minute scout said mr tate mr finch did you hear them atticus said he didn t he had the radio on aunt alexandra had hers going in her bedroom he remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she could hear hers atticus smiled i always play a radio too loud i wonder if the neighbor heard anything said mr tate i doubt it heck most of them listen to their radio or go to bed with the chicken maudie atkinson may have been up but i doubt it go ahead scout mr tate said well after jem yelled we walked on mr tate i wa shut up in my costume but i could hear it myself then footstep i mean they walked when we walked and stopped when we stopped jem said he could see me because mr crenshaw put some kind of shiny paint on my costume i wa a ham how s that asked mr tate startled atticus described my role to mr tate plus the construction of my garment you should have seen her when she came in he said it wa crushed to a pulp mr tate rubbed his chin i wondered why he had those mark on him his sleeve were perforated with little hole there were one or two little puncture mark on his arm to match the hole let me see that thing if you will sir atticus fetched the remains of my costume mr tate turned it over and bent it around to get an idea of it former shape this thing probably saved her life he said look he pointed with a long forefinger a shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire bob ewell meant business mr tate muttered he wa out of his mind said atticus don t like to contradict you mr finch wasn t crazy mean a hell low down skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill child he d never have met you face to face atticus shook his head i can t conceive of a man who d mr finch there s just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to em even then they ain t worth the bullet it take to shoot em ewell a one of em atticus said i thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me even if he hadn t i thought he d come after me he had gut enough to pester a poor colored woman he had gut enough to pester judge taylor when he thought the house wa empty so do you think he da met you to your face in daylight mr tate sighed we d better get on scout you heard him behind you yes sir when we got under the tree how d you know you were under the tree you couldn t see thunder out there i wa barefooted and jem say the ground s always cooler under a tree we ll have to make him a deputy go ahead then all of a sudden somethin grabbed me an mashed my costume think i ducked on the ground heard a tusslin under the tree sort of they were bammin against the trunk sounded like jem found me and started pullin me toward the road some mr ewell yanked him down i reckon they tussled some more and then there wa this funny noise jem hollered i stopped that wa jem s arm anyway jem hollered and i didn t hear him any more an the next thing mr ewell wa tryin to squeeze me to death i reckon then somebody yanked mr ewell down jem must have got up i guess that s all i know and then mr tate wa looking at me sharply somebody wa staggerin around and pantin and coughing fit to die i thought it wa jem at first but it didn t sound like him so i went lookin for jem on the ground i thought atticus had come to help u and had got wore out who wa it why there he is mr tate he can tell you his name a i said it i half pointed to the man in the corner but brought my arm down quickly lest atticus reprimand me for pointing it wa impolite to point he wa still leaning against the wall he had been leaning against the wall when i came into the room his arm folded across his chest a i pointed he brought his arm down and pressed the palm of his hand against the wall they were white hand sickly white hand that had never seen the sun so white they stood out garishly against the dull cream wall in the dim light of jem s room i looked from his hand to his sand stained khaki pant my eye traveled up his thin frame to his torn denim shirt his face wa a white a his hand but for a shadow on his jutting chin his cheek were thin to hollowness his mouth wa wide there were shallow almost delicate indentation at his temple and his gray eye were so colorless i thought he wa blind his hair wa dead and thin almost feathery on top of his head when i pointed to him his palm slipped slightly leaving greasy sweat streak on the wall and he hooked his thumb in his belt a strange small spasm shook him a if he heard fingernail scrape slate but a i gazed at him in wonder the tension slowly drained from his face his lip parted into a timid smile and our neighbor s image blurred with my sudden tear hey boo i said content prev next chapter mr arthur honey said atticus gently correcting me jean louise this is mr arthur radley i believe he already know you if atticus could blandly introduce me to boo radley at a time like this well that wa atticus boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where jem wa sleeping for the same shy smile crept across his face hot with embarrassment i tried to cover up by covering jem up ah ah don t touch him atticus said mr heck tate sat looking intently at boo through his horn rimmed glass he wa about to speak when dr reynolds came down the hall everybody out he said a he came in the door evenin arthur didn t notice you the first time i wa here dr reynolds s voice wa a breezy a his step a though he had said it every evening of his life an announcement that astounded me even more than being in the same room with boo radley of course even boo radley got sick sometimes i thought but on the other hand i wasn t sure dr reynolds wa carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper he put it down on jem s desk and took off his coat you re quite satisfied he s alive now tell you how i knew when i tried to examine him he kicked me had to put him out good and proper to touch him so scat he said to me er said atticus glancing at boo heck let s go out on the front porch there are plenty of chair out there and it s still warm enough i wondered why atticus wa inviting u to the front porch instead of the livingroom then i understood the livingroom light were awfully strong we filed out first mr tate atticus wa waiting at the door for him to go ahead of him then he changed his mind and followed mr tate people have a habit of doing everyday thing even under the oddest condition i wa no exception come along mr arthur i heard myself saying you don t know the house real well i ll just take you to the porch sir he looked down at me and nodded i led him through the hall and past the livingroom won t you have a seat mr arthur this rocking chair s nice and comfortable my small fantasy about him wa alive again he would be sitting on the porch right pretty spell we re having isn t it mr arthur yes a right pretty spell feeling slightly unreal i led him to the chair farthest from atticus and mr tate it wa in deep shadow boo would feel more comfortable in the dark atticus wa sitting in the swing and mr tate wa in a chair next to him the light from the livingroom window wa strong on them i sat beside boo well heck atticus wa saying i guess the thing to do good lord i m losing my memory atticus pushed up his glass and pressed his finger to his eye jem s not quite thirteen no he s already thirteen i can t remember anyway it ll come before county court what will mr finch mr tate uncrossed his leg and leaned forward of course it wa clear cut self defense but i ll have to go to the office and hunt up mr finch do you think jem killed bob ewell do you think that you heard what scout said there s no doubt about it she said jem got up and yanked him off her he probably got hold of ewell s knife somehow in the dark we ll find out tomorrow mi ter finch hold on said mr tate jem never stabbed bob ewell atticus wa silent for a moment he looked at mr tate a if he appreciated what he said but atticus shook his head heck it s mighty kind of you and i know you re doing it from that good heart of yours but don t start anything like that mr tate got up and went to the edge of the porch he spat into the shrubbery then thrust his hand into his hip pocket and faced atticus like what he said i m sorry if i spoke sharply heck atticus said simply but nobody s hushing this up i don t live that way nobody s gon na hush anything up mr finch mr tate s voice wa quiet but his boot were planted so solidly on the porch floorboard it seemed that they grew there a curious contest the nature of which eluded me wa developing between my father and the sheriff it wa atticus s turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch he said h rm and spat dryly into the yard he put his hand in his pocket and faced mr tate heck you haven t said it but i know what you re thinking thank you for it jean louise he turned to me you said jem yanked mr ewell off you yes sir that s what i thought i see there heck thank you from the bottom of my heart but i don t want my boy starting out with something like this over his head best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open let the county come and bring sandwich i don t want him growing up with a whisper about him i don t want anybody saying jem finch his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that sooner we get this over with the better mr finch mr tate said stolidly bob ewell fell on his knife he killed himself atticus walked to the corner of the porch he looked at the wisteria vine in his own way i thought each wa a stubborn a the other i wondered who would give in first atticus s stubbornness wa quiet and rarely evident but in some way he wa a set a the cunningham mr tate s wa unschooled and blunt but it wa equal to my father s heck atticus s back wa turned if this thing s hushed up it ll be a simple denial to jem of the way i ve tried to raise him sometimes i think i m a total failure a a parent but i m all they ve got before jem look at anyone else he look at me and i ve tried to live so i can look squarely back at him if i connived at something like this frankly i couldn t meet his eye and the day i can t do that i ll know i ve lost him i don t want to lose him and scout because they re all i ve got mr finch mr tate wa still planted to the floorboard bob ewell fell on his knife i can prove it atticus wheeled around his hand dug into his pocket heck can t you even try to see it my way you ve got child of your own but i m older than you when mine are grown i ll be an old man if i m still around but right now i m if they don t trust me they won t trust anybody jem and scout know what happened if they hear of me saying downtown something different happened heck i won t have them any more i can t live one way in town and another way in my home mr tate rocked on his heel and said patiently he d flung jem down he stumbled over a root under that tree and look i can show you mr tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife a he did so dr reynolds came to the door the son deceased s under that tree doctor just inside the schoolyard got a flashlight better have this one i can ease around and turn my car light on said dr reynolds but he took mr tate s flashlight jem s all right he won t wake up tonight i hope so don t worry that the knife that killed him heck no sir still in him looked like a kitchen knife from the handle ken oughta be there with the hearse by now doctor night mr tate flicked open the knife it wa like this he said he held the knife and pretended to stumble a he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of him see there stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his rib his whole weight drove it in mr tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket scout is eight year old he said she wa too scared to know exactly what went on you d be surprised atticus said grimly i m not sayin she made it up i m sayin she wa too scared to know exactly what happened it wa mighty dark out there black a ink d take somebody mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness i won t have it atticus said softly god damn it i m not thinking of jem mr tate s boot hit the floorboard so hard the light in miss maudie s bedroom went on miss stephanie crawford s light went on atticus and mr tate looked across the street then at each other they waited when mr tate spoke again his voice wa barely audible mr finch i hate to fight you when you re like this you ve been under a strain tonight no man should ever have to go through why you ain t in the bed from it i don t know but i do know that for once you haven t been able to put two and two together and we ve got to settle this tonight because tomorrow ll be too late bob ewell s got a kitchen knife in his craw mr tate added that atticus wasn t going to stand there and maintain that any boy jem s size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a grown man in the pitch dark heck said atticus abruptly that wa a switchblade you were waving where d you get it took it off a drunk man mr tate answered coolly i wa trying to remember mr ewell wa on me then he went down jem must have gotten up at least i thought heck i said i took it off a drunk man downtown tonight ewell probably found that kitchen knife in the dump somewhere honed it down and bided his time just bided his time atticus made his way to the swing and sat down his hand dangled limply between his knee he wa looking at the floor he had moved with the same slowness that night in front of the jail when i thought it took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it in his chair mr tate clumped softly around the porch it ain t your decision mr finch it s all mine it s my decision and my responsibility for once if you don t see it my way there s not much you can do about it if you wanta try i ll call you a liar to your face your boy never stabbed bob ewell he said slowly didn t come near a mile of it and now you know it all he wanted to do wa get him and his sister safely home mr tate stopped pacing he stopped in front of atticus and his back wa to u i m not a very good man sir but i am sheriff of maycomb county lived in this town all my life an i m goin on forty three year old know everything that s happened here since before i wa born there s a black boy dead for no reason and the man responsible for it s dead let the dead bury the dead this time mr finch let the dead bury the dead mr tate went to the swing and picked up his hat it wa lying beside atticus mr tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on i never heard tell that it s against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed which is exactly what he did but maybe you ll say it s my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up know what d happen then all the lady in maycomb includin my wife d be knocking on his door bringing angel food cake to my way of thinkin mr finch taking the one man who s done you and this town a great service an draggin him with his shy way into the limelight to me that s a sin it s a sin and i m not about to have it on my head if it wa any other man it d be different but not this man mr finch mr tate wa trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot he pulled his nose then he massaged his left arm i may not be much mr finch but i m still sheriff of maycomb county and bob ewell fell on his knife good night sir mr tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard his car door slammed and he drove away atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time finally he raised his head scout he said mr ewell fell on his knife can you possibly understand atticus looked like he needed cheering up i ran to him and hugged him and kissed him with all my might yes sir i understand i reassured him mr tate wa right atticus disengaged himself and looked at me what do you mean well it d be sort of like shootin a mockingbird wouldn t it atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it when he got up and walked across the porch into the shadow his youthful step had returned before he went inside the house he stopped in front of boo radley thank you for my child arthur he said content prev next chapter when boo radley shuffled to his foot light from the livingroom window glistened on his forehead every move he made wa uncertain a if he were not sure his hand and foot could make proper contact with the thing he touched he coughed his dreadful raling cough and wa so shaken he had to sit down again his hand searched for his hip pocket and he pulled out a handkerchief he coughed into it then he wiped his forehead having been so accustomed to his absence i found it incredible that he had been sitting beside me all this time present he had not made a sound once more he got to his foot he turned to me and nodded toward the front door you d like to say good night to jem wouldn t you mr arthur come right in i led him down the hall aunt alexandra wa sitting by jem s bed come in arthur she said he s still asleep dr reynolds gave him a heavy sedative jean louise is your father in the livingroom yes ma am i think so i ll just go speak to him a minute dr reynolds left some her voice trailed away boo had drifted to a corner of the room where he stood with his chin up peering from a distance at jem i took him by the hand a hand surprisingly warm for it whiteness i tugged him a little and he allowed me to lead him to jem s bed dr reynolds had made a tent like arrangement over jem s arm to keep the cover off i guess and boo leaned forward and looked over it an expression of timid curiosity wa on his face a though he had never seen a boy before his mouth wa slightly open and he looked at jem from head to foot boo s hand came up but he let it drop to his side you can pet him mr arthur he s asleep you couldn t if he wa awake though he wouldn t let you i found myself explaining go ahead boo s hand hovered over jem s head go on sir he s asleep his hand came down lightly on jem s hair i wa beginning to learn his body english his hand tightened on mine and he indicated that he wanted to leave i led him to the front porch where his uneasy step halted he wa still holding my hand and he gave no sign of letting me go will you take me home he almost whispered it in the voice of a child afraid of the dark i put my foot on the top step and stopped i would lead him through our house but i would never lead him home mr arthur bend your arm down here like that that s right sir i slipped my hand into the crook of his arm he had to stoop a little to accommodate me but if miss stephanie crawford wa watching from her upstairs window she would see arthur radley escorting me down the sidewalk a any gentleman would do we came to the street light on the corner and i wondered how many time dill had stood there hugging the fat pole watching waiting hoping i wondered how many time jem and i had made this journey but i entered the radley front gate for the second time in my life boo and i walked up the step to the porch his finger found the front doorknob he gently released my hand opened the door went inside and shut the door behind him i never saw him again neighbor bring food with death and flower with sickness and little thing in between boo wa our neighbor he gave u two soap doll a broken watch and chain a pair of good luck penny and our life but neighbor give in return we never put back into the tree what we took out of it we had given him nothing and it made me sad i turned to go home street light winked down the street all the way to town i had never seen our neighborhood from this angle there were miss maudie s miss stephanie s there wa our house i could see the porch swing miss rachel s house wa beyond u plainly visible i could even see mr dubose s i looked behind me to the left of the brown door wa a long shuttered window i walked to it stood in front of it and turned around in daylight i thought you could see to the postoffice corner daylight in my mind the night faded it wa daytime and the neighborhood wa busy miss stephanie crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to miss rachel miss maudie bent over her azalea it wa summertime and two child scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance the man waved and the child raced each other to him it wa still summertime and the child came closer a boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him a man stood waiting with his hand on his hip summertime and his child played in the front yard with their friend enacting a strange little drama of their own invention it wa fall and his child fought on the sidewalk in front of mr dubose s the boy helped his sister to her foot and they made their way home fall and his child trotted to and fro around the corner the day s woe and triumph on their face they stopped at an oak tree delighted puzzled
